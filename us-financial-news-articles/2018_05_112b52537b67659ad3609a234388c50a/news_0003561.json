FILE PHOTO: Anti-establishment 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio speaks following a talk with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, April 12, 2018\nAfter a populist coalition between the winning 5-Star movement and far-right League turned out (for now) to be a non-starter, the outgoing centre-left Democratic Party (PD) will decide today whether to open government negotiations with 5-Star. The chances of that do not look good, given the outright hostility of influential ex-party leader Matteo Renzi to any such tie-up.\nTo the relief of financial markets, Italian President Sergio Mattarella yesterday said he would not call early national elections in June and said his preferred solution to the logjam was a caretaker government that would at least be able to put together a budget for next year. “Winning elections keeps people together, losing causes dissent. Conservatives will need to avoid the ill-discipline of fighting like ferrets in a sack” Rob Wilson, former Conservative MP\nSuch are the low expectations of British PM Theresa May's Conservatives in today's local elections that it would take a spectacularly bad result to loosen her already tenuous grip on national power. That might still come about but the opposition Labour Party's cause has not been helped in recent weeks with a rash of headlines about anti-Semitic leanings within its ranks .\nBrexit will inevitably be part of the sub-text of the vote: battlegrounds will include once staunch Conservative London boroughs such as Wandsworth, which voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, while outside the capital any swing to the Conservatives in pro-Brexit areas will be taken as an endorsement of May's EU exit strategy .\nThe Armenian stand-off may take a decisive turn today if de facto protest leader Nikol Pashinyan receives assurances from the ruling Republican Party that it will back him for premier in a new parliamentary vote due next week. He has called on his supporters to take a breather today - but told them to be ready to go back onto the streets if no such assurance is forthcoming.\nFlash euro zone inflation for April is due out at 0900 GMT. Analysts see another weak reading at 1.3 percent, which will complicate yet further the ECB's goal of removing stimulus : ECB chief Mario Draghi said he expected it would hover around 1.5 pct for the rest of the year.\nMARKETS A woman waves as she sets up a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in London, May 3, 2018\nWith the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting doing little to shake existing thinking in world markets, the focus has shifted back to the simmering U.S.-China trade standoff and the heaviest part of the European earnings season in particular. The simplest takeaway from the Fed is that markets remained priced for two more interest rate rises this year, with the next one next month.\nFears that the Fed’s statement would flag concern about accelerating headline inflation proved unfounded and, if anything, the stress that the central bank put on its “symmetric” inflation target was read as it being more relaxed about recent price trends. Ten-year Treasury yields are little changed this morning at about 2.97 percent and the dollar has dialled back slightly from its recent peaks.\nEuro/dollar bounced from a low of $1.1936 on Wednesday, though it remains below $1.20 as traders awaited flash April inflation readings for the euro zone later. The U.S. Treasury quarterly refunding announcement also disappointed some who felt it might have seen a push of debt sales further out the maturity spectrum. Instead it introduced a new 2-month Treasury bill to soak up the still-heavy reliance on short-dated debt.\nDollar strength and jitters about further U.S. regulatory action against Chinese telecoms firms saw the S&P500 slip 0.7 percent overnight, though futures are up slightly this morning. Shanghai shares are up 0.5 percent, meantime, as the high-level U.S. trade delegation – including Treasury Secretary Mnuchin – settle down to talks in Beijing. Hopes of a breakthrough this week were downplayed, with the officials scheduled to leave again on Friday.\nEven though Tokyo was closed, other Asian bourses traded heavily. HK stocks were down more than 1 percent and Seoul’s Kospi index was down 0.7 percent. Anxiety about a unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the international Iran nuclear deal kept oil prices underpinned, with Brent crude holding above $73. European stock futures are expected to open slightly lower.\nEven though the euro has started to weaken in the last couple of weeks, its strength has weighed on company results during the first quarter. Today, Bayer shares are seen falling 1-2 percent after the group cut its full-year guidance today , blaming the strong currency. Adverse FX also led to a 2 percent revenue drop at healthcare group Fresenius (down 1 percent premarket) and resulted in a lower-than-expected core profit for Belgian chemicals group Solvay (down 1-2 percent premarket).\nElsewhere, emerging markets remain under pressure, with Turkey's lira setting a new record low against the dollar ahead of April inflation numbers later. It's been a torrid week for Turkey, with a sovereign credit rating downgrade , data showing the first manufacturing contraction for 14 months and a surge in the country's trade deficit.\n— A look at the day ahead from European Economics and Politics Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
