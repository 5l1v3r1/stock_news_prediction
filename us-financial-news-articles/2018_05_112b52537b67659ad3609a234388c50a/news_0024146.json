Their license was due to expire in May 2019.\nOther retention licences canceled by the mining commission target other nickel, gold, silver, copper and rare earth exploration companies.\nTanzania, Africa’s fourth-largest gold producer, is seeking a bigger slice of the pie from its vast mineral resources by overhauling the fiscal and regulatory regime of its mining sector.\nRetention licences were previously granted for a period not exceeding five years, which was renewable.\nTanzanian President John Magufuli appointed the chairman and commissioners for the country’s new mining commission last month, paving the way for tighter regulation of the mining sector.\nMagufuli sent shock-waves through the mining industry with a series of actions since his election in late 2015.\nIn July last year, he suspended the issuance of all new mining licences until the new mining commission was in place.\nThe new mining rules state that “all retention licences issued prior to the date of publication of these regulations are hereby canceled and shall cease to have legal effect.”\n“Consequent upon cancellation of retention license...rights over all areas which were subject of retention licences are hereby and without further assurance reverted to the government.”\nCanada’s Barrick Gold Corp, the world’s biggest gold producer, is also the majority shareholder of London-listed Acacia Mining Plc, which is embroiled in a tax dispute with the Tanzanian government over mineral exports.\nBarrick and Glencore have been looking for potential buyers for the Kabanga project since 2015 after lower global nickel prices derailed the project, according to mining sources in Tanzania.\nThe two miners have held the license for the project since 2009, which is estimated to have inferred resource of 36.3 million tonnes, grading 2.8 percent nickel.\nUnder legislation passed last Julyr, the mining commission has been given extensive powers to regulate and monitor the mining industry and mining operations in Tanzania.\nReporting by Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala; Editing by George Obulutsa\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T19:51:35.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
