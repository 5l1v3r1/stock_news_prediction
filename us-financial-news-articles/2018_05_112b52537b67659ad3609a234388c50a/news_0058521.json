Audacious backhand passing shots on the Nadal first serve and delightfully disguised drop shots brought frequent loud gasps from the crowd.\nSpeaking after the match, Nadal said he should have been more aggressive in response to the Bolelli attack.\nTennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates winning his first round match against Italy's Simone Bolelli REUTERS/Christian Hartmann “It was difficult today to play so aggressive, being in the first round and against a player who really came on court and decided to play that strong,” Nadal told reporters.\nEven so, he maintained the calm and poise of a French Open champion who entered the tournament with a 79-2 win-loss record at Roland Garros, retrieving seemingly impossible balls and letting rip with his own exquisite passing shots.\nTennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates winning his first round match against Italy's Simone Bolelli REUTERS/Christian Hartmann He survived four set points against him in the tiebreak, coming back from a 3-6 deficit, before finally triumphing.\nBolelli was fearless from the outset, with nothing to lose. Nadal, after all, had won his tenth French Open title in 2017 without dropping a single set and has been in imperious form, arriving in Paris with a 19-1 win-loss record on clay this year.\nThe world number one grinded out Monday’s first set 6-4 but the Italian kept coming, at times hitting the ball harder and flatter than Nadal to lead by a break in the second before Nadal fought back to take a two-set lead.\nStill Bolelli was not yet done, returning to the court on Tuesday with an early third set break in the bag and hitting ferociously at the Nadal baseline. Yet he was unable to break through and squandered four set points.\nEven in defeat, Bolelli said he would be leaving Paris happy.\n“It gives me a lot of confidence, I played a really good tennis,” the Italian told a post-match news conference. “I think maybe I deserved the third set. But Rafa is like this, you have to go after every point, pushing and pushing.”\nReporting by Richard Lough; Editing by Martyn Herman and Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:58:50.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
