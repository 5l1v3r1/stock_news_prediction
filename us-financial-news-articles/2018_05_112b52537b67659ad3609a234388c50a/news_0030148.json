Britain Soccer Football - Wolverhampton Wanderers v Newcastle United - Sky Bet Championship - Molineux - 11/2/17 Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Ed Sykes Livepic\nFormer Liverpool, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss Benitez, who took charge of Newcastle in 2016, helped the club secure a 10th-placed league finish this season, ending the campaign with a thumping 3-0 win over Chelsea on Sunday.\nThe Spaniard, who has a year left on his contract, has been critical of Newcastle’s poor transfer dealings throughout the season.\n“Rafa, as always, has my full support, and contrary to some media reports that portray me as a pantomime villain, I will continue to ensure that every penny generated by the club is available to him,” Ashley said on Newcastle’s website.\n“I hope very much that Rafa will remain at Newcastle United.”\nAshley previously promised investment at the end of the 2016-17 campaign after Newcastle won promotion from the Championship but the funds did not materialise, leading Benitez to deal with a thin squad throughout the season.
