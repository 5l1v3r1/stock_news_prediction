The record deficit was the C$20.20 billion set in the third quarter of 2010.\nThe trade deficit in goods jumped to C$8.97 billion from C$7.49 billion as imports grew at a faster rate than exports.\nImports rose to C$148.23 billion from C$145.25 billion on higher shipments of motor vehicles and parts as well as energy products. Exports edged up to C$139.26 billion from C$137.75 billion on greater demand for energy products.\nDirect investment in Canada for the quarter rose to C$17.79 billion, the highest level in two and a half years, with more than half of the money going to the manufacturing sector.\n($1=$1.30 Canadian)\nReporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Paul Simao\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
