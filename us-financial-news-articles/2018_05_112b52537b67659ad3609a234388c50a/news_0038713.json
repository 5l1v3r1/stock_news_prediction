But this one case is different, the government is very firm it wouldn’t be able to pay back,” said one of the sources.\nCompany executives have conducted several rounds of talks with local officials but they have yet to break a deadlock, according to the sources.\nLocal government officials have insisted on rolling over the loans for another year as the city authorities struggle to boost their fiscal revenues, the sources said.\n“The government’s argument is that only interest will be paid,” said one of the sources.
