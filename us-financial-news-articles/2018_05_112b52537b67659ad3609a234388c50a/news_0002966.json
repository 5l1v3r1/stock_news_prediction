Today, especially, we think of our dedicated colleagues Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who have spent 143 day imprisoned in Myanmar simply for doing their jobs. We continue to call for their immediate release.\nToday and every day, Reuters is committed to the principles of press freedom, and we believe a free press is fundamental to any democracy. World Press Freedom Day is an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to producing independent, unbiased journalism that helps people make better-informed decisions in their professional and personal lives.
