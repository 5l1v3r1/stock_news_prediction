As previously disclosed, VF's Board of Directors authorized a change in the company's fiscal year end to the Saturday closest to March 31 from the Saturday closest to December 31. As a result, throughout this press release, we refer to the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 as the “transition period.” All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. This release refers to “reported” and “currency neutral” amounts, terms that are described under the heading “Currency Neutral - Excluding the Impact of Foreign Currency.” Unless otherwise noted, “reported” and “currency neutral” amounts are the same. This release also refers to “continuing” and “discontinued” operations amounts, which are concepts described under the heading “Discontinued Operations - Nautica ® Brand Business and Licensing Business.” Unless otherwise noted, results presented are based on continuing operations. This release also refers to “adjusted” amounts, terms that are described under the heading “Adjusted Amounts - Excluding Williamson-Dickie, Icebreaker ® and Altra ® Transaction and Deal Related Expenses and the Provisional Impact of U.S. Tax Legislation.” Unless otherwise noted, “reported” and “adjusted” amounts are the same.\n“VF's transition period results were strong as the broad-based growth acceleration that began in the second half of 2017 continued,” said Steve Rendle, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our core growth engines are driving strong global momentum as we begin to enter the acceleration phase of our 2021 strategy. VF is in the midst of a transformation to become a purpose-led, consumer-centric organization. We are evolving and adapting to a rapidly changing marketplace and remain committed to delivering top quartile returns for our shareholders.”\nCurrency Neutral - Excluding the Impact of Foreign Currency\nThis release refers to “reported” amounts in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. This release also refers to “currency neutral” amounts, which exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency neutral amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.\nDiscontinued Operations - Nautica ® Brand Business and Licensing Business\nOn March 19, 2018, the company announced it had reached an agreement to sell its Nautica ® brand business to Authentic Brands Group (ABG), LLC. and the sale was completed on April 30, 2018. Accordingly, the company has classified the assets and liabilities of the Nautica ® brand business as held-for-sale and has included the operating results of this business in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nOn April 28, 2017, the company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group (LSG) business, including the Majestic ® brand. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to entirely exit the licensing business and completed the sale of the assets of the JanSport ® brand collegiate business in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, the company has removed the assets and liabilities of the licensing business as of the dates noted above and included the operating results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe company’s after-tax net loss from discontinued operations was approximately $8 million in the transition period, which includes an increase in the estimated loss on the sale of the Nautica ® brand business recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the operating results of the Nautica ® brand business during the transition period.\nAdjusted Amounts - Excluding Williamson-Dickie, Icebreaker ® and Altra ® Transaction and Deal Related Expenses and the Provisional Impact of U.S. Tax Legislation\nThis release refers to adjusted amounts that exclude transaction and deal related expenses associated with the acquisitions of Williamson-Dickie, Icebreaker ® and Altra ® . Total transaction and deal related expenses were approximately $14 million in the transition period.\nAdjusted amounts in this release also exclude the provisional amounts recorded due to recent U.S. tax legislation. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act reduces the federal tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21 percent and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies are required to pay tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. Additionally, revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21 percent is also required. The transitional impact of the Tax Act resulted in a provisional net charge of approximately $465 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which was further adjusted by a $5 million benefit in the transition period.\nCombined, the above net charges negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 during the transition period. All adjusted amounts referenced herein exclude the effects of these amounts.\nReconciliations of measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.\nTransition Period Income Statement Review\nRevenue increased 22 percent (up 17 percent currency neutral) to $3.0 billion, including a $233 million revenue contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, revenue increased 12 percent (up 8 percent currency neutral), driven by broad-based strength across VF’s international and direct-to-consumer platforms and Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Gross margin improved 20 basis points to 50.5 percent, as benefits from a mix-shift toward higher margin businesses and changes in foreign currency were partially offset by the impact of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. On an adjusted basis, gross margin increased 50 basis points to 50.8 percent. Excluding the impact of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, adjusted gross margin increased 160 basis points to 51.9 percent. Changes in foreign currency positively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points on a reported basis. Operating income on a reported basis was $311 million. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased 14 percent to $330 million, including a $16 million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Operating margin on a reported basis decreased 140 basis points to 10.2 percent. Adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points to 10.8 percent. Adjusted operating margin, excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, declined 40 basis points to 11.2 percent. Changes in foreign currency positively impacted operating margin by 20 basis points on a reported basis. Earnings per share was $0.65 on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 30 percent (22 percent currency neutral) to $0.67, including a $0.03 contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights\nInventories were up 17 percent compared with the same period in 2017. Excluding the impact of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, inventories increased less than 2 percent. During the transition period, VF repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $250 million. The company has $4 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.\nFull Year Fiscal 2019 Outlook\nVF’s full year fiscal 2019 outlook includes the following:\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $13.45 billion to $13.55 billion, reflecting growth of approximately 9 percent to 10 percent. By coalition, revenue for Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase 8 percent to 10 percent; revenue for Jeanswear is expected to be about flat compared to prior year; and Imagewear revenue is expected to increase more than 35 percent. International revenue is expected to increase 13 percent to 15 percent. By geographic region, European revenue is expected to increase 13 percent to 15 percent. In the Asia Pacific region, revenue is expected to increase 15 percent to 17 percent. And, in the Americas (non-U.S.) region, revenue is expected to increase 10 percent to 12 percent. Direct-to-consumer revenue is expected to increase 8 percent to 10 percent, including more than 25 percent growth in digital. Gross margin is expected to be about 51 percent. Operating margin is expected to increase 50 basis points to about 13.2 percent. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.53, reflecting growth between 11 percent and 13 percent. Cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $1.6 billion. Other full year assumptions include an effective tax rate of approximately 17 percent and capital expenditures of approximately $275 million.\nDividend Declared\nVF’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, payable on June 18, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 8, 2018.\nWebcast Information\nVF will host its transition period conference call beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF from translating its foreign revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars, and from entering foreign currency transactions. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results. As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present currency neutral financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. We use currency neutral information to provide a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the effects of changes in the rates used to calculate foreign currency translation, and transaction gains and losses. Management believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparison of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses. To calculate foreign currency translation on a currency neutral basis, operating results for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year (rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period). Similarly, transaction gains and losses on a currency neutral basis are calculated using exchange rates from the comparable period of the prior year. These currency neutral performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

(a) The contribution from Williamson-Dickie represents its operating results, excluding transaction and deal related costs, beginning on the acquisition date of October 2, 2017. The impact on the diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations was calculated using a tax rate of 17% and 20% for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective periods. The contribution from Williamson-Dickie has been reflected in VF's Imagewear coalition for segment reporting purposes since the acquisition date. (b) Transaction and deal related costs include acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisitions of Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. (\"Williamson-Dickie\"), Icebreaker Holdings Limited (\"Icebreaker\") and Altra ® brand, additional cost of goods sold recognized by Williamson-Dickie due to fair value inventory adjustments calculated as part of the purchase price accounting and a non-operating net benefit from hedging the purchase price of Icebreaker. The transaction and deal related costs resulted in net tax benefits of $3.3 million, $2.0 million and $1.6 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018, December 30, 2017, and September 30, 2017, respectively. The diluted earnings per share impact was calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective periods. Transaction and deal related costs associated with the Williamson-Dickie acquisition of $11.4 million and $6.9 million have been reported in VF's Imagewear coalition for segment reporting purposes in each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. The remaining transaction and deal related costs have been reported as corporate expenses. (c) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and moved from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. Additionally, revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21% is also required. The transitional impact of the Tax Act resulted in a provisional net charge of $465.5 million for the three months ended December 30, 2017. Measurement period adjustments related to the provisional net charge were recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2018, resulting in a tax benefit of $5.1 million. The diluted earnings per share impact was calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective periods. (d) Amounts shown in the table have been calculated using unrounded numbers. Non-GAAP Financial Information In connection with a change in fiscal year end to the Saturday closest to March 31 from the Saturday closest to December 31, VF is reporting a transition quarter from December 31, 2017 through March 31, 2018. VF's next fiscal year will run from April 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019 (“Fiscal 2019”). The financial metrics provided for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2018 are non-GAAP measures and have been presented in order to provide a comparison that aligns with VF's new fiscal year end. The quarterly and trailing twelve month financial information has also been presented on an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of tax reform and transaction and deal related costs, and on an adjusted organic basis, which excludes the operating results of Williamson-Dickie beginning on the acquisition date of October 2, 2017. These adjusted presentations are non-GAAP measures. Management believes these measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding VF's underlying business trends and the performance of VF's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. Management uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting and review process and, in some cases, as a factor in determining compensation. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, VF's operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nVF CORPORATION Supplemental Financial Information Reconciliation of Select GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures - Trailing Twelve Months Ended April 1, 2017 (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months\nEnded\nJuly 2, 2016\nThree Months\nEnded\nOctober 1, 2016\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31, 2016\nThree Months\nEnded\nApril 1, 2017\nTrailing Twelve\nMonths Ended\nApril 1, 2017\nTotal revenues - Reported GAAP $ 2,231,203 $ 3,218,833 $ 3,037,543 $ 2,500,340 $ 10,987,919 Gross profit - Reported GAAP $ 1,090,241 $ 1,584,242 $ 1,524,456 $ 1,256,735 $ 5,455,674 Restructuring charges (a) — — 23,275 — 23,275 Adjusted gross profit - Non-GAAP $ 1,090,241 $ 1,584,242 $ 1,547,731 $ 1,256,735 $ 5,478,949 Operating income - Reported GAAP $ 186,252 $ 594,849 $ 282,426 $ 289,653 $ 1,353,180 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (a) — — 79,644 — 79,644 Restructuring charges (a) — — 55,019 — 55,019 Pension settlement charge (a) — — 50,922 — 50,922 Adjusted operating income - Non-GAAP $ 186,252 $ 594,849 $ 468,011 $ 289,653 $ 1,538,765 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (b) $ 0.31 $ 1.13 $ 0.57 $ 0.51 $ 2.52 * Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (a) — — 0.15 — 0.15 Restructuring charges (a) — — 0.10 — 0.10 Pension settlement charge (a) — — 0.08 — 0.08 Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (b) $ 0.31 $ 1.13 $ 0.90 $ 0.51 $ 2.85 Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 422,059 419,240 417,891 415,960 418,787 * * Recalculated on a trailing twelve-month basis for the period ended April 1, 2017.
