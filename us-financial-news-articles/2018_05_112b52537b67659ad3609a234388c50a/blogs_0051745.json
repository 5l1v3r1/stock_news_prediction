Photo: Reuters\nThe U.K. Serious Fraud Office brought additional charges Tuesday against two people facing trial in its ongoing investigation of Monaco-based Unaoil Group.\nBasil Al Jarah, who was Unaoil’s Iraq partner, and Ziad Akle, the group’s territory manager for Iraq, were charged with conspiracy to make corrupt payments to secure a contract for Leighton Contractors Singapore PTE Ltd., the SFO said. The $733 million contract relates to a project to build two oil pipelines in southern Iraq.\nMessrs. Al Jarah and Akle will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Wednesday, a procedural formality to decide at which court the case will be heard.\nA White & Case partner confirmed the firm is representing Mr. Akle and declined to comment. Brown Rudnick represents Mr. Al Jarah and didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe SFO couldn’t immediately say whether the new charges will be combined with the ongoing trial in which the two individuals are facing charges of making corrupt payments to win contracts in Iraq for Dutch oil-services firm SBM Offshore, a Unaoil client.\nTwo other people were charged in November in relation to the SBM Offshore part of the investigation into Unaoil’s activities. Paul Bond, a former sales manager for SBM, and Stephen Whiteley, a former SBM vice president and Iraq, Kazakhstan and Angola territories manager for Unaoil, both were charged with conspiracy to make corrupt payments from 2005 to 2011.\nThe four individuals are due to appear before Southwark Crown Court on July 25, as the trial continues.\nSBM Offshore settled a U.S. bribery case, agreeing to pay $238 million.\nThe SFO is conducting a criminal investigation of Unaoil’s activities and those of its officers, employees and agents in connection with suspected offenses of bribery, corruption and money laundering. It began the probe in March 2016 following a series of media reports , including one in which a former Unaoil employee admitted paying bribes .\nThe U.K.’s special prosecutor announced its investigation into Unaoil in July 2016, but has yet to charge the company.\nA Unaoil spokesperson denied to comment on the ongoing investigation. A message on the company’s website says that the “press articles and the investigations have had a devastating impact on the business” and have pushed a number of companies in the group into liquidation. The company “vigorously” denies the bribery allegations.\nThe SFO has also been trying to obtain the extradition of Saman Ahsani, the son of Unaoil’s founder and was the firm’s commercial director. A Monaco court denied the SFO’s petition for Mr. Ahsani’s extradition earlier this year.\nCorrects to Brown Rudnick in 4th paragraph.\nWrite to Mara Lemos Stein at mara.lemos-stein@wsj.com.
