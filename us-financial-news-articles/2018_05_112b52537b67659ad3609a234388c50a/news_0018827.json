He retired at the end of March.\nMr. Robb centered Clorox’s business on the domestic market even as other companies chased profits overseas. He positioned the maker of bleach, toilet cleaner and disinfecting wipes to dominate in midsize-product categories while keeping cost down.\n“What Steve Robb provided was a lot of consistency,” said Jason Gere, a consumer-products analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, adding Mr. Robb was instrumental in cutting costs, integrating acquisitions and training future leaders.\nEarlier in the year, the company reported overall sales growth of 1% for the quarter ended Dec. 31, helped by double-digit volume gains in sales of wellness-related items such as probiotics and water-filtration systems.\nOverall, the company’s financial strength is reflected in its dividend policy. The company has increased its dividend annually for four decades.\nThat success didn’t come without some hard calls by Mr. Robb, who rose to the CFO post in 2011. “During my tenure we were coming out of the worst recession we had seen in a generation,” he said.\nClorox’s decision to focus heavily on its U.S. business roughly seven years ago was one of the most controversial strategic moves in Mr. Robb’s career, he said.\n“Keep in mind that this was at a time when many other companies were chasing BRIC,” he said, referring to the acronym for the block of developing countries that include Brazil, Russia, India and China.\n“One of the toughest days was our decision to exit Venezuela,” Mr. Robb said, reflecting on a move announced in September 2014. “We were losing too much money as a company.”\nVenezuela’s socialist government choked the private sector with regulations that have stirred inflation, which the International Monetary Fund estimates could reach 13,000% this year.\nMr. Robb also backed Clorox’s strategy of establishing strong brands in smaller product categories. The company’s 2016 acquisition of Renew Life, the maker of probiotic products sold at natural grocers like Whole Foods for $295 million is one such move.\nMr. Robb, the son of an engineer and a stay-at-home mom, grew up in the heart of what was to become Silicon Valley, about 40 miles southeast of San Francisco in Sunnyvale, Calif.\nHe left home while still a teenager and swept floors and bused tables to pay his bills. “I’ve worked in restaurants, I’ve been a janitor, I worked for UPS. It’s honorable work,” he said.\nMr. Robb worked full time while attending college. He graduated in 1988 from San Jose State University with a degree in finance and economics. The next year, now married, Mr. Robb took a staff accountant position at Oakland-based Clorox, about 90 minutes from his hometown.\n“I laughingly remember telling my wife that I would join Clorox, stay for a couple of years and then probably move to a different company,” he said. “I never expected to be CFO and I didn’t expect to stay nearly 30 years. Clorox was my first and last company in finance.”\nMr. Robb had stints as the finance chief of Clorox’s household segment and as head of global finance overseeing the company’s daily finance operations.\n“Steve leaves a tremendous legacy of financial stewardship and discipline that has served the company and investors well and will contribute to the company for years to come,” said Clorox Chief Executive Benno Dorer in a statement earlier in the year.\nLooking back, Mr. Robb said he is most proud of launching an internal developmental program that established training classes for employees.\n“Those are the moments that change the culture in a company,” he said.\nClorox treasurer Paola Gonzalez said Mr. Robb, her mentor, encouraged her to pursue an opportunity she didn’t feel confident about, adding she wouldn’t be in her current post if not for him.\n“He told me that he thought I had the right skills and would be successful,” said Ms. Gonzalez. “I’m not the only one he has done that for.”\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nStephen Robb is the former chief financial officer of Clorox Co.
