We know the number of viewers, we also know the reviews, who is watching, the buzz of it — and that's something HBO can offer television creators,\" Rich said.\nFurthermore, Rich said creators can rest assured their shows will be promoted, unlike at Netflix, where they \"have 20 open in a week and only a couple get special attention.\"\nBut it all comes down to quality of content.\n\"We really try to curate and find high-quality stuff, like 'Westworld,' 'Game of Thrones' and, we hope 'Succession,'\" Rich said.\n\"Succession\" premiers June 3, and details the rise and fall of media dynasties, a narrative Rich says is very appropriate, given turmoil among the Murdoch family and 21st Century Fox and the Redstone family and CBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:51:22.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
