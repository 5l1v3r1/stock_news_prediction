They made the quarter-finals in 1958, 1962 and 1970, losing to Sweden, Chile and Uruguay.\nCoach: Stanislav Cherchesov\nThe former goalkeeper won four Russian league titles with Spartak Moscow and three league championships in Austria with FC Tirol Innsbruck in a long career which also included 39 caps for Russia and eight appearances for the Soviet Union.\nHe began coaching in Austria, later returning to manage a host of Russian sides including Spartak and Dynamo Moscow.\nHe led Polish side Legia Warsaw to a league and cup double in 2015-16 and was named Leonid Slutsky’s successor in charge of the Russian national team in 2016.\nHe clung on to his job despite suffering an early exit in the Confederations Cup by coming third in their group behind Portugal and Mexico.\nCherchesov has prioritized the team’s defense, assembling a new-look back three protected by five midfielders. He also has a reputation for making bold decisions, removing reliable defensive midfielder Igor Denisov from the team after falling out with him at Dynamo Moscow.\nKey players:\nFyodor Smolov: The charismatic striker was written off early in his career after a disappointing spell at Feyenoord and a long goal drought with Anzhi Makhachkala but has roared back with Krasnodar to finish as second top scorer in the Russian Premier League.\nWith 12 goals in 30 international games, he is his country’s best hope of getting out of the group.\nIgor Akinfeev: A one-club man with CSKA Moscow, the goalkeeper has kept more clean sheets than anyone else in the history of Russia’s top flight.\nThe keeper has more than 100 caps since making his debut in 2004 although he has made costly errors, such as conceding soft goals against South Korea and Algeria in the last World Cup which led to Russia’s early elimination.\nAleksei Miranchuk: The playmaker was one of the key men behind Lokomotiv Moscow winning their first league title in 14 years this season.\nTwin brother of fellow Russia international Anton, he is Russia’s most creative player, with a deft touch and a penchant for producing tricks.\nForm guide:\nRussia’s recent results do not make for positive reading: they have lost eight games out of 18 under Cherchesov, winning only five. Most of these matches were friendlies while they lost to Portugal and Mexico in the Confederations Cup and beat New Zealand.\nA 4-2 victory over South Korea in October offered hope but they have failed to win in five games since. They battled back to draw 3-3 with Spain in November and were beaten 3-0 by Brazil and 3-1 by France in their most recent games.\nHow they qualified: as tournament hosts\nProspects:\nThere is a serious danger Russia could join South Africa from 2010 in being the only World Cup tournament hosts to fail to get out of their group.\nCherchesov’s squad are young, inexperienced and mostly play in Russia’s top flight, meaning the majority of their players have barely tested themselves against international opponents.\nThe one thing in their favor is a kind draw which placed them alongside Uruguay, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in Group A. The South Americans will be expected to top the group, meaning Russia are likely to be battling Egypt and Saudi Arabia for second spot and a place in the last 16.\nReporting by Richard Martin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:32:41.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
