But until Tuesday, 3 percent level wasn’t convincingly broken.\n“The dollar stands to benefit, particularly against the euro, on higher Treasury yields. But against the yen, its advance could stall if the negative impact of higher yields on equities is prolonged,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\nThe yen tends to benefit during times of market turmoil and investor risk aversion.\n“The next focal point is trying to figure out the yield levels which are bearable for equities,” Ishikawa said.\nThe uptick in U.S. yields unnerved equity markets and sent Wall Street shares significantly lower on Tuesday.\nThe euro was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1823 after brushing $1.1817, its weakest since late December.\nThe dollar was little changed at 110.300 yen, having risen to 110.450 overnight, its strongest since Feb. 5.\nThe yen barely budged after data showed Japan’s economy contracted for the first time in nine quarters during January-March.\nThe Australian dollar was largely flat at $0.7467 after sliding 0.7 percent overnight. The New Zealand dollar, which fell about 0.75 percent the previous day to a five-month trough of $0.6855, last traded at $0.6882.\nThe pound was a shade weaker at $1.3499 after slipping to $1.3452 on Tuesday, its lowest since Dec. 29.
