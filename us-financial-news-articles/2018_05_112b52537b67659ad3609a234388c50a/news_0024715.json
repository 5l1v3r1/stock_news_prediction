REUTERS/Max Rossi/File Photo\nTo address concerns that their pledges to raise welfare spending and cut taxes will undermine the economic stability of the heavily indebted country, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the administration would not be a threat to Europe.\nDi Maio met with League leader Matteo Salvini for a second consecutive day, and afterward they signalled there had been progress on policy, but still offered no names for the top job.\nAsked about the premiership, Salvini told reporters: “When we have something to say, we’ll say it.”\nThe two party leaders will meet again in Milan on Saturday, and a 5-Star source said the aim was to offer a candidate to President Sergio Mattarella on Sunday.\nVincenzo Spadafora, a close aide to Di Maio, said the two parties were looking for someone outside both parties who “has a high profile and is trusted by Italian citizens and Italy’s international partners”.\nDi Maio insisted after the March 4 election that he should be the next prime minister, but dropped this demand last week to help clinch a deal with the League.\n5-Star won 32 percent of the vote, making it the largest party in parliament, while the League got 17 percent to become the second-largest. Salvini said weeks ago he would not insist on leading any government his group was a part of.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi “RATIONAL AND REASONABLE”\nThe parties said meetings to agree a programme to cut taxes, hike welfare payments and bolster efforts to stop irregular immigration had made progress.\nOn Thursday, news that they were seeking to form a government pushed the gap between Italian benchmark bond yields and the safer German equivalent to its widest in seven weeks on concerns that the state accounts might take a hit.\n“It’s being called a populist government. Some have said it’s a threat to the people,” Di Maio told reporters after meeting Salvini. “Some say it’s a threat to Europe ... but it’s not Europe that’s under threat.”\nThe Italian-German bond spread narrowed on Friday, returning to where it was before 5-Star and the League began negotiations.\nThough both parties have said they want to renegotiate the EU’s fiscal rules to allow Italy to spend more, a 5-Star source said that any plans to increase the budget deficit would be discussed with Brussels first.\n“The government will be rational and reasonable (with the public accounts),” the source said.\n5-Star’s flagship policy is universal income support for the poor, while the League’s main campaign promise was a “flat tax” of 15 percent for individuals and companies. Both policies would be costly for Italy’s strained public finances.\nThe parties have also said they want to head off a value-added tax increase worth 12.5 billion euros ($14.9 billion) due to kick in next year unless alternative deficit cuts are found.\nPresident Mattarella can veto the make-up of any new administration and would need to endorse the parties’ choice for prime minister before a government can be formed.
