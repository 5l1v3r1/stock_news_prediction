The mode allows up to 100 online players to battle each other to the death until only one player survives.\nSales at EA’s high-margin digital business however rose 18 percent to $1.10 billion in the fourth quarter as more gamers bought their titles online instead of purchasing physical copies from retail stores.\nNet income rose to $607 million, or $1.95 per share, in the fourth quarter ended March. 31, from $566 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.\nVideogame companies are required to defer some revenue from certain online-enabled games following a tweak to the U.S. accounting rules.\nOn an adjusted basis, EA’s revenue was $1.26 billion for the reported quarter, beating estimates of $1.24 billion.
