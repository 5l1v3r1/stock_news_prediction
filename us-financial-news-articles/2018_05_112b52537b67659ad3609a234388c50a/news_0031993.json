I was aiming 15 feet left and just kind of started it a little bit left and it faded with the wind right on line.”\nThe only previous albatross at the hole was by Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello last year.\nKoepka finished tied for 11th at 11-under 277, seven strokes behind winner Webb Simpson.\nKoepka was delighted with his performance in his third event back after missing more than three months with a left wrist injury.\n“I’ve been knocking on the door,” said the American.\n“It’s just sometimes when you’re off for four months you come back, you need to play a little bit, get some rhythm and it’s nice to finally shoot a low one.\n“There’s nobody more excited to be here than me. To get back out it felt like it took forever. The days were very long.” (Reporting by Andrew Both Editing by Toby Davis / Ian Ransom)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T02:56:34.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
