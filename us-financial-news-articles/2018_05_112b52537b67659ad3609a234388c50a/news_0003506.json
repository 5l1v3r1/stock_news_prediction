A lawyer for Walker, 43, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe case brought to four the number of former State Street employees who have since 2016 been accused by federal prosecutors in Boston of participating in schemes to fleece the bank’s clients.\nThe cases followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients mark-ups on certain transactions.\nState Street in January 2017 agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations.\nProsecutors accused McLellan and two other executives, Richard Boomgaardt and Edward Pennings, of conspiring to add secret commissions for trades performed for six clients of the bank’s “transition management” business in 2010 and 2011.\nThat unit helps institutional clients move their investments between asset managers or liquidate investment portfolios, prosecutors said.\nWalker during much of his time at State Street from 2004 to 2015 was likewise assigned to that unit.\nFriday’s complaint said that in 2011 Walker participated in a scheme with McLellan and another unnamed State Street employee to defraud the insurance company through inflated trading commissions.\nThe scheme caused the insurance company and the funds it advised to be secretly overcharged by more than $800,000, the complaint said.\nBoomgaardt and Pennings pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. State Street said it is cooperating with authorities.\nThe case is U.S. v. Walker, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-mj-07160.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T19:07:33.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
