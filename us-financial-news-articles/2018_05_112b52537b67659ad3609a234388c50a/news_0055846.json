We do not believe that paralysis and pressure for adjusting prices is the answer,” reads the letter, written in the midst of nationwide trucker strikers over diesel prices which has wrought havoc on commerce in Brazil.\n“It would be a step backward which would increase our debt, harm consumers, the company and ultimately Brazilian society.”\nBrazilian oil workers have called a strike for Wednesday.
