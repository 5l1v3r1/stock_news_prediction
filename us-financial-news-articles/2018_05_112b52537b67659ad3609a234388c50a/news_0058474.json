Australia boasts the third-largest pool of retirement savings in the world, according to OECD data. “SUPER” FUNDS’ INFLOWS GUARANTEEDThe industry enjoys billions of dollars of guaranteed inflows a year, underpinned by a mandatory system where almost one-tenth of a worker’s wage is deposited into a pension fund, known locally as a superannuation or “super” fund to be accessed at retirement.\nAbout 60 percent of those inflows go to default funds, according to Jeff Bresnahan, chairman at research house SuperRatings, because most workers don’t actively research and choose their own fund.\n“There will be some funds that have underperformed for some time and are still getting strong flows,” Bresnahan said.\nHe noted, however, that the Commission’s proposal might not be workable, given it would be difficult to choose the “best 10” products when performance can be cyclical, and funds must also be measured on their fee structures and life insurance arrangements.\nThe Productivity Commission will hold public hearings next month before finalizing the recommendations it sends to the government for possible implementation.\nPension assets totaled A$2.6 trillion at the end of the December 2017 quarter, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.\nLast year, the asset pool grew in size by 10.1 per cent, driven by investment returns and new contributions.\nAny move to change the default fund system would likely ignite a new battle between commercial, or retail, funds and the country’s union-backed industry funds.\nIndustry funds have historically dominated the default market, locking in agreements with some of Australia’s biggest sectors, including manufacturing and education.\nCommercial funds, run by the major banks and wealth managers, have lobbied the center-right federal government for employers to be allowed to directly negotiate default arrangements.
