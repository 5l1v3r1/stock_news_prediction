Xiaomi is expected to sell its shares in July, while China Tower is aiming to float soon after the summer lull, sources said.\nChina Tower's IPO is being led by China International Capital Corp (CICC) and Goldman Sachs.\nThe company operated 1.9 million tower sites and had 2.7 million tenants at the end of last year. Its operating revenue in 2017 rose nearly 23 percent to 68.7 billion yuan ($10.8 billion), while profit rose more than 25 times to 1.9 billion yuan, the prospectus showed.\nThe IPO was expected to launch early this year, but was delayed, according to sources, by the difficulties of obtaining all the requisite approvals from state regulators as well as the company's three main state-backed owners - China Mobile , China Telecom and China Unicom.\nThe three combined their towers in a bid to streamline operations and reduce tower duplication. At the time, China Mobile held 38 percent, China Unicom, 28.1 percent and China Telecom, 27.9 percent. China Reform Holding, a state-owned asset manager, took the remaining 6 percent.\nValuations of some global rivals are high.\nU.S.-listed American Tower and Crown Castle International are trading on about 54 times and 111 times last year's earnings, respectively, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nBoth are structured as real estate investment trusts - a group particularly prized by investors in recent years for the high dividends they pay.\nTelecoms companies around the world have sought to spin out and merge tower operations to cut costs.\nIndia's Bharti Infratel is in the process of becoming the world's second-largest mobile mast operator by merging its operations with those of Indus Tower, creating a giant with more than 163,000 towers.\n($1 = 6.3365 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Jennifer Hughes and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by David Goodman and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:54:19.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
