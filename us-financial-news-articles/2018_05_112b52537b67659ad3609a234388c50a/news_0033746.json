The new company, which brings together three market leaders and creates a comprehensive care continuum of personal care, skilled home healthcare, and hospice care, will serve more than 63,000 patients and their families daily, employing over 31,000 caregivers across 15 states in 221 locations.\nFollowing its acquisition of Jordan in December 2010, Palladium implemented key elements of its GOLâ„¢ value creation framework, focusing on Jordan's growth, operations and leadership. Palladium assisted in the recruitment of senior team members and the build out of an in-house M&A team, supported the company's investment in corporate infrastructure and diversification into new business lines and helped facilitate more than 30 acquisitions. Jordan's related organic growth initiatives and its M&A program expanded the company's service offerings, allowing the company to achieve geographic scale and lead the consolidation in its markets.
