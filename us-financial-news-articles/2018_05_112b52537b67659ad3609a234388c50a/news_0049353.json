The Civil Aviation Administration of China declined to provide immediate comment when reached by phone.\nSelf-ruled Taiwan is claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory, and has become one of China’s most sensitive issues and a potential military flashpoint. Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously.\nChina has in recent months been upping its policing of how foreign firms describe these territories. Japanese retailer Muji was fined after being found to be using packaging that listed Taiwan as a country while U.S. retailer Gap Inc issued an apology last week for selling a T-shirt which it said had an incorrect map of China.\nSome airlines such as Air Canada, Lufthansa and British Airways have already made changes to their websites, according to Reuters’ checks. The Taiwanese foreign ministry last week asked Air Canada for a “speedy correction” after the carrier made the changes.\nChinese state-backed tabloid the Global Times late on Wednesday published a post on social media platform Wechat naming U.S. carriers United Airlines, American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines as being among those that had yet to alter their characterisation of Taiwan.
