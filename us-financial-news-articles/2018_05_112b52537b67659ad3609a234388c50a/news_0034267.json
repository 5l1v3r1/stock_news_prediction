AUGUSTINE, Fla., Creative Learning Corporation (OTCPK: CLCN)\nCreative Learning Corporation recorded a net profit of $39,000 in the second quarter of the 2018. This is an improvement of $198,000 from the same quarter in 2017. The results were due to higher revenue and lower professional fees, primarily lower legal expense. The Company reported revenues of $608,000 during the quarter compared to $582,000 in the same quarter of 2017 due to an increase in initial franchise sales.\nChristian Miller, COO and CFO of the Company stated, \"We believe we are beginning to see the results of the changes we have made in various segments of the business.
