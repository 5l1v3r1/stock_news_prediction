I just have to keep enjoying it, keep enjoying the journey.”\nLast year Shapovalov cracked the top 200, top 100 and became the youngest player to rise into the top 50 since Nadal in 2004.\nHe reached the Montreal Masters semi-final in 2017 and while his game is best-suited to hardcourts, he made the Madrid semi-finals this month, raising his hopes for Roland Garros.\nHis inexperience on the clay surface showed against Marterer, occasionally trying to pull the pin too early in rallies.\nBut he is determined to master the dirt surface.\n“You run into guys that are playing well, playing hot. In Madrid it was me, today it was Max,” he said.\n“I feel like my game does suit this court. And I feel like in the future I could get really good on it.\n“I’m pretty excited about that. I’m pretty excited to come back next year and play all these clay tournaments again.”\nThe good news for those who drool over his lavish groundstrokes is that he will not look to tame his style.\n“I think I have to keep my character on the court, keep my game style, you know, which is being aggressive, dictating, coming to the net a lot,” he said.\n“Definitely a bit more patience is going to be better for me, just staying with these guys, opening up the court more, stuff like this. But at the end of the day I still have to keep my identity, keep my game style.”\nShapovalov’s game began to fray in the middle of the second set when a double-fault at 3-3 gave Marterer the break.\nThe German, also playing in the main draw for the first time, faltered when serving for the second set at 5-4 but he made no mistake in the tiebreak.\nAnother double-fault gave Marterer a set point at 5-6 in the third and while Shapovalov found the line with a forehand to stave it off Marterer converted a second with a superb backhand.\nMarterer saved break points at 2-2 and 4-4 in the fourth set and broke to love to claim victory.
