The primary endpoint was achieved, with a 10-week ongoing pregnancy rate of 35.6% for nolasiban treated patients vs. 28.5% for placebo treated patients, a 25% relative increase (p= 0.031). In the ET Day 5 subgroup, the relative increase was 32% and the absolute increase was 11.2% in favor of nolasiban (nolasiban 45.9% and placebo 34.7%, p = 0.034). In addition, nolasiban treatment was safe and well tolerated with no difference in rates of discontinuation from treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE's) nor the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE's) as compared to placebo.\nPatient randomization was completed in the first quarter of 2018 for the EDELWEISS Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109, ObsEva's oral GnRH receptor antagonist for the treatment of endometriosis. The trial enrolled nearly 330 patients combined in Europe and the U.S., and is comparing 4 different doses of OBE2109 to placebo, with the goal of identifying dosages that can alleviate pain symptoms utilizing either partial or full estrogen suppression to offer potential alternatives both with and without hormonal add back therapy (ABT).\nPatient enrollment continued in the PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids, with a target enrollment of approximately 1,000 women in total (US and Europe). These trials are designed to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids, with efficacy and safety of 2 doses being studied, one with ABT and one without ABT.\nFirst patients were enrolled in the PROLONG Phase 2a clinical trial of OBE022, ObsEva's oral prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor antagonist for the treatment of pre-term labor in pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation.\nUpcoming Milestones\nObsEva expects to achieve the following clinical and regulatory milestones during 2018:\n12-week results from the Phase 2b EDELWEISS clinical trial of OBE2109 for the treatment of endometriosis, by the end of Q2:18 and readout of 24-week treatment data, including bone mineral density measurement in Q4:18. End-of-phase 2 meeting with regulatory authorities to discuss the design of the phase 3 program for that indication is expected by the end of 2018.\nGiven current trends, completion of patient enrollment in the Phase 3 PRIMROSE 2 trial of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids continues to be targeted for the end of 2018, while PRIMROSE 1 enrollment completion is anticipated in Q1:19\nResults of live birth rate and 28-day neonatal safety from the Phase 3 IMPLANT2 clinical trial of nolasiban in IVF in Q4:18. Post consultation with regulatory authorities, initiation of a US Phase 3 clinical development program is planned for Q4:18.\nSafety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in pregnant women, and interim efficacy from the Phase 2a PROLONG clinical trial of OBE022 in pre-term labor in Q4:18.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $19.8 million, or ($0.54) per basic and diluted share, vs. $15.5 million or ($0.58) per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses were $16.3 million and general and administrative expenses were $3.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, vs. $13.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Our first quarter 2018 net loss included non-cash expenses of $2.4 million for share-based compensation, vs. $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, ObsEva had cash and cash equivalents of $95.4 million.\nConference Call Information\nObsEva will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, 2 p.m Central European Time, to provide a business update and discuss first quarter 2018 financial results.
