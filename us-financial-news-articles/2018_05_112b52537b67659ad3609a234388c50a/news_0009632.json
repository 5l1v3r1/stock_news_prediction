It also marks the eighth add-on for Albireo, which is an ExecFactor ® executive-led platform initiative launched by Huron Capital to provide smart building automation and energy services to commercial and institutional customers throughout the U.S. The acquisition is expected to bolster Albireo's presence in the New York City region and expand its capabilities in systems integration.\nFounded in 1981, EMCC provides integrated building solutions across diverse markets, including universities, healthcare institutions, and commercial facilities, throughout the New York City area. Primary offerings include the installation, operation and maintenance of air volume systems, heating/air conditioning ventilation, and security and access control.\n\"We are very excited to become part of the Albireo Energy family and to have access to the operational expertise and industry knowledge of Huron Capital,\" said John Piraino, President of EMCC. \"Most importantly, we will be able to bring more resources to the market and our current customers, and our employees will have greater opportunities for growth as part of the larger Albireo organization.\"\n\"Last year we doubled our presence in the New York area and the EMCC acquisition adds to this momentum, further affirming the Huron Capital business case for Albireo's continued growth in the fragmented building automation and energy services market,\" said Phil Rogers, CEO of Albireo Energy. \"We believe EMCC's sustainable energy savings and infrastructure offerings coupled with its long-standing tradition of excellent service improves our ability to serve key markets key in the region.\"\nHuron Capital formed Albireo in 2014 to pursue the vast building automation services and energy efficiency markets in the U.S., which are expected to experience continued growth in the coming years. In addition to the EMCC transaction, Albireo has completed seven acquisitions over the past four years. Those companies include Energy Options, Electronic Controls Systems, Energy Systems Technologies, Green Total Solutions, Sky Technologies, GxP Automation, and Advance Power Control.\n\"Albireo exemplifies Huron Capital's ExecFactor® buy-and-build investment model,\" said Jim Mahoney, Senior Partner at Huron Capital. \"Over the last four years we have collaborated with Phil and the Albireo team to aggressively identify and pursue opportunities to enhance the platform's service offerings and customer base, resulting in what we see as eight impactful acquisitions.\"\nAbout Huron Capital\nBased in Detroit, Huron Capital is an operationally-focused private equity firm with a long history of growing lower middle-market companies through our proprietary ExecFactor® buy-and-build investment model.
