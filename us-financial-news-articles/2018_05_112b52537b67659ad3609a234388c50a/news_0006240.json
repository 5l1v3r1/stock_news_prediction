Are we able to issue in different currencies other than dollars, yes. Are we keen to take that step at the moment, I don’t think so,” Fahad al-Saif told a business conference in Riyadh.\n“We don’t wanna take a step unless it reflects that issuances are mature issuances,” he said.\nAmong emerging market economies, Argentina last year sold a 100-year bond in U.S. dollars, joining some countries in the euro zone who have taken advantage of a low-yield environment to sell long-dated bonds.
