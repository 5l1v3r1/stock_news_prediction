(NASDAQ: LPNT) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe following highlights the Company’s results of operations as presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nSame-hospital revenues totaled $1,603.1 million, an increase of 0.4% compared to the same period last year; Net loss totaled $5.3 million; Diluted loss per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders was $0.22; and Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $100.6 million, an increase of $8.9 million, or 9.7%, compared to the same period last year.\nThe Company’s results of operations for the first quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, included the following non-operational adjustments:\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized a net charge of $72.7 million, or $1.44 loss per diluted share, primarily related to impairment losses recognized in connection with the Company’s entry into definitive agreements to sell the assets of three hospital campuses located in Louisiana. For the first quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a net gain of $25.9 million, or $0.39 earnings per diluted share, related to the transfer of certain of the Company’s home health agencies and hospices to In-Home Healthcare Partnership (“IHHP”), a joint venture with LHC Group, Inc., which the Company does not consolidate, and the settlement of a contingent liability previously established in connection with a prior hospital acquisition.\nExcluding the non-operational adjustments listed above, highlights of the Company’s results of operations, as adjusted on a non-GAAP basis, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were as follows:\nAdjusted net income totaled $51.7 million; Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders were $1.22; and Adjusted EBITDA totaled $188.5 million.\nAdditional information regarding adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders, and adjusted EBITDA, including uses by management and others, and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures of financial performance, is set forth under the section titled “Unaudited Supplemental Information.”\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s same-hospital revenues increased $6.9 million, or 0.4%, to $1,603.1 million, compared to $1,596.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in the Company’s same-hospital revenues consisted of a 2.6% increase in same-hospital revenues per equivalent admission, partially offset by a 2.2% decrease in same-hospital equivalent admissions for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period last year. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the transfer of the Company’s home health and hospice service lines to IHHP, the Company’s same-hospital revenues increased $15.3 million, or 1.0%, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period last year.\nWhen adjusted to exclude the aforementioned first quarter 2018 and 2017 non-operational adjustments, adjusted net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $51.7 million, compared to adjusted net income of $47.8 million for the same period last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $1.22, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders of $1.07 for the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $188.5 million, or 11.8% of revenues, compared to $195.6 million, or 12.0% of revenues, for the same period last year. This decrease was partially the result of the recognition of $3.2 million less in Medicare and Medicaid electronic health record (“EHR”) incentive payments during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year. The Company’s EHR incentive payments have gradually decreased and ultimately ended in 2017.\nCommenting on the results, William F. Carpenter III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LifePoint Health, said, “We are pleased with the solid first quarter 2018 results, which demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy. Our continued focus on quality of care, operational excellence and effective cost management helped drive sequential margin expansion and strong cash flow during the quarter, and we also continued to utilize our financial strength to return capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our strategic priorities to continue creating value for shareholders.”\nA listen-only simulcast, as well as a 30-day replay, of LifePoint Health’s first quarter 2018 conference call will be available on line at www.lifepointhealth.net/investor-relations today, Friday, May 4, 2018, beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nLifePoint Health (NASDAQ: LPNT) is a leading healthcare company dedicated to Making Communities Healthier®.

When significant, LifePoint’s management and Board of Directors typically exclude these gains or losses when evaluating the Company’s operating performance and in certain instances when evaluating performance for incentive compensation purposes. Additionally, the Company believes that some investors and equity analysts exclude these or similar items when evaluating the Company’s current or future operating performance and in making informed investment decisions regarding the Company. Accordingly, the Company provides adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measures of net (loss) income and diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders, respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders should not be considered measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and the items excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net (loss) income or diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders as presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations to adjusted net income (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Net (loss) income $ (5.3 ) $ 64.0 Adjustments (net of income taxes): Impairment losses 58.2 – Gains on home health partnership transaction (1.2 ) (4.9 ) Gain on settlement of contingent liability – (11.3 ) Adjusted net income $ 51.7 $ 47.8 The following table reconciles diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations to adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders $ (0.22 ) $ 1.46 Adjustments (net of income taxes): Impairment losses 1.47 – Gains on home health partnership transaction (0.03 ) (0.12 ) Gain on settlement of contingent liability – (0.27 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders $ 1.22 $ 1.07\nLIFEPOINT HEALTH, INC.\nUNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (Continued)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; other non-operating losses (gains), net; provision for income taxes; and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. LifePoint’s management and Board of Directors use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes. LifePoint’s credit facilities use adjusted EBITDA, subject to further permitted adjustments, for certain financial covenants. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA is a measure of performance used by some investors, equity analysts, rating agencies and lenders to make informed decisions as to, among other things, the Company’s ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. In addition, multiples of current or projected adjusted EBITDA are used by some investors and equity analysts to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance. Because adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations to adjusted EBITDA (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Amount % of\nRevenues\nAmount % of\nRevenues\nNet (loss) income $ (5.3 ) (0.3 )% $ 64.0 3.9 % Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests (3.5 ) (0.2 ) (4.1 ) (0.2 ) Net (loss) income attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc.
