So this is about helping address that unfairness.”\nForrest offered to donate A$3 million ($2.26 million) to Rugby Australia to retain Force in Super Rugby but was brushed off by chairman Cameron Clyne.\nHe has instead ploughed his money into the World Series which aims to speed the game up with a number of rule changes.\nIt will feature seven-point “power tries” awarded when teams take the ball out from behind their own 22-metre line and cross without coughing up possession or committing a penalty.\nSet pieces, a part of rugby that often tests viewers’ patience, will be quicker, with a one-minute time limit placed on scrums. Teams will also be allowed up to 12 substitutions, up from the traditional eight.\nPlenty of scepticism surrounds the tournament’s ability to generate fan interest and sponsors, but the Force’s opener against the Fijian Warriors is expected to draw over 15,000 people to Perth Rectangular Stadium, a decent crowd by Super Rugby standards.\nThe match will also be broadcast live on a free-to-air channel in Western Australia, and on a delayed broadcast to other states. Super Rugby is broadcast exclusively by a pay-TV provider.\nOfficials at World Rugby are certain to be among the interested viewers, to see the market’s response to a tournament that borrows heavily from the ideas that underpinned cricket’s reinvention through the Twenty20 format.\nRugby Australia, mindful of Super Rugby’s problems, may also watch with some anxiety.\n($1 = 1.3263 Australian dollars)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T10:16:59.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
