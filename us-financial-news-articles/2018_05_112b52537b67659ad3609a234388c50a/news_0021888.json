It traded at 63.33 per dollar on Tuesday.\nRussian consumers usually interpret rouble depreciation as a sign that prices for cars, which are mostly built from imported parts and materials even when assembled locally, will rise, as happened after the rouble’s steep decline in 2014-2016.\n“New vehicle orders have spiked as a result, and will continue to materialize as extra good news in the sales statistics in the short term,” Schreiber said in a statement.\nLast month, AEB said it expected sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles in Russia to rise by 10 percent in 2018, to 1.75 million units.\nIn 2017, Russian car sales totaled 1.6 million units, up 11.9 percent from the previous year, but still only around half the nearly 3 million units sold in 2012 when the market was booming.\nReporting by Anastasia Lyrchikova and Andrey Ostroukh; Writing by Andrey Ostroukh; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:17:45.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
