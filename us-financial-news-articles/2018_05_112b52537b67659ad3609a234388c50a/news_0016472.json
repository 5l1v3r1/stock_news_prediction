The Dubai index lost 0.4 percent.\n“Stock markets in the Gulf have been weak (over the) last couple of weeks - so quite likely the event is priced in. There are other moving parts in this geopolitical equation, including the wars in Yemen and Syria, and so Iran’s reaction would be keenly watched,” said Vrajesh Bhandari, portfolio manager at Al Mal Capital.\n“The rise in Brent to a three-and-a-half year high has significant positive implications for oil exporting nations. If crude oil can hold these levels for a while, I think investors would begin factoring in the improving macro fundamentals,” he added.\nIn Saudi, Al Rajhi Bank rose 0.4 percent and property developer Jabal Omar went up 0.5 percent.\nIn Abu Dhabi, the main index was helped by First Abu Dhabi Bank which jumped 2.2 percent and Dana Gas that added 0.9 percent.\nDamac properties jumped 3.5 percent, leading Dubai market’s early gainers. Doha index’s main support came from Industries Qatar and Commercial Bank of Qatar which rose 0.9 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.
