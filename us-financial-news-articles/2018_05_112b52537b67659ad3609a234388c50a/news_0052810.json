The exchange offers trading in four of the largest coins: bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash.\nThe number of cryptocurrencies has surged to more than 1,600 over the past year in part fueled by a boom in initial coin offerings (ICO), online fundraisers where new coins are issued to contributors.\nSome U.S. exchanges have been more cautious about listing ICO tokens because of concerns that they might be considered unregistered securities and could require platforms that list them to be licensed by regulators.\nIn March the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors that platforms offering trading of digital assets that are securities and operate as an “exchange” must register with regulators.\nCoinbase will “eventually” offer access to Paradex services to its U.S. customers after it implements “changes for compliance purposes,” it said.\nThe company also said on Wednesday that it is overhauling its trading platform for professional investors known as GDAX. Customers of GDAX will be rolled over to the revamped service called Coinbase Pro at the end of June, it said.\nCoinbase announced last week that it was revamping its trading technology and creating a new suite of services to attract more institutional investors, including hedge funds and high-frequency trading firms.
