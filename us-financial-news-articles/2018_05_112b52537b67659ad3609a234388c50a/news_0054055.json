REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo The consortium includes Alibaba’s majority-owned logistics affiliate Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Ltd, Alibaba and ZTO said in a joint statement without disclosing the identity of other investors. They said they expect the deal to close in June.\nThe investment would be Alibaba’s third in a Chinese courier after buying a minority stakes in YTO Express Group Co Ltd and Best Inc.\nThe e-commerce firm has been expanding its logistics network at home and abroad as it works to diversify its customer base. As part of that effort, it became majority shareholder in September of Cainiao, which provides logistics support to Alibaba’s main e-commerce platform, Taobao.\nZTO owns 1 percent of Cainiao, which it co-founded with Alibaba and over a dozen other Chinese companies in 2013.\nZTO’s chairman, Lai Meisong, told Reuters the latest deal would allow ZTO and Alibaba to better share resources and help ZTO cut costs through access to new technologies. He said the pair decided to enter a deal so as to work more closely on operations and build trust between affiliates.\nA sign of Alibaba Group is seen during the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, December 3, 2017. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo ZTO said Alibaba will have a seat on its board.\n“This trust will improve the efficiency of our cooperation,” Lai said in a telephone interview.\nShanghai-based ZTO’s $1.4 billion New York listing was the United States’ largest listing in 2016 and was the biggest by a Chinese firm since Alibaba’s $25 billion initial public offering in 2014.\nZTO shares closed at a lifetime high of $19.30 on Friday, their most recent day of trading, valuing the firm at $13.7 billion.\nFILE PHOTO: Workers listen to their line manager as he prepares them for the upcoming Singles Day shopping festival, at a sorting centre of ZTO Express, in Chaoyang district, Beijing, China November 8, 2015.

It said it handled 6.2 billion parcels in 2017, giving it a 15.5 percent market share, from 7.6 percent in 2011.\nReporting by Brenda GohEditing by Christopher Cushing\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
