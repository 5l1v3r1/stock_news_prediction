The S&P energy index was down 1.7 percent.\nNetflix’s stock market value ballooned to a record $153 billion and eclipsed Walt Disney Co for the first time, making it the world’s most valuable entertainment company. Netflix shares were up 1.9 percent, helping the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\nAt 3:34 p.m. (1934 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 54.63 points, or 0.22 percent, to 24,832.18, the S&P 500 lost 3.96 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,729.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.53 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,433.48.\nEarlier in the session the blue chip Dow touched a two-week low.\nDefense stocks jumped after Trump called off the North Korea meeting and warned that the U.S. military was ready in the event of any “reckless” acts by North Korea.\nFord and General Motors gained on the possibility of tariffs on European and Asian car imports. U.S.-listed shares of Fiat fell 1 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 41 new lows.
