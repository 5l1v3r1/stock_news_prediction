I know dressing rooms very well and I know exactly what goes through the head of a footballer,” Zidane told reporters on Wednesday.\n“That’s very important for me but it’s not the only thing. There’s a lot of work and a philosophy behind this. I’m not the best coach, I’m not the best tactically, but I have something else, passion and hope. That’s worth a lot more.”\nThe Frenchman is the polar opposite of predecessor Rafael Benitez, a renowned tactician who had no playing career and who struggled to connect with the highly strung Madrid squad before he was sacked.\n“Zidane has understood how to manage such a complicated dressing room with sensitivity. We are delighted that he is the captain of this ship and I hope he stays for a long time,” said Real captain Sergio Ramos.\nNot everyone, however, has been convinced by the Frenchman’s work.\nSome sections of the Spanish media have written Zidane off as lucky, accusing him of enjoying a favourable draw in the 2016 Champions League run and benefiting from generous refereeing in the last two campaigns.\nHis former Juventus team mate Alessandro del Piero, meanwhile, said last year that Zidane “knows how to manage a dressing room but he’s helped by the fact he has an incredible squad, the best in the world.”\nA hapless domestic campaign, in which his team finished a humiliating 17 points behind Liga champions Barcelona, has made the idea he is more of a supervisor of star players than a top coach more persuasive. HUGE IMPACT\nYet Zidane also deserves credit for his in-game management. His two substitutions, Marco Asensio and Lucas Vazquez, had a huge impact in the 3-1 win over Paris St Germain in the last-16 first leg.\nIn the semi-final first leg against Bayern Munich he again turned to Asensio when Isco was injured and pushed Vazquez to right back, where the winger shackled Franck Ribery.\nHe has also proved to be his own man, benching Real’s record signing Gareth Bale in the latter stages of this year’s competition and marginalising another expensive recruit in James Rodriguez last season.\n“He is a hard worker, he hates to lose, he wants perfection,” former Real Madrid midfielder Christian Karembeu told Reuters.\n“He wants quality and you can see Zidane’s prints on this Madrid team. The passing has to be good, the players have to be in the right position, and you can see his influence on the team. Of course, when you look at the players you see the talent there, but talent alone does not bring you success.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:31:38.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
