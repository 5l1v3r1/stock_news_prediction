(Nasdaq:ENT) (“Global Eagle,” the “Company” or “we”), a leading provider of media, content, connectivity and data analytics to markets across air, sea and land, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, Global Eagle recorded revenue of $156 million; incurred a net loss of $38.3 million; and generated Adjusted EBITDA* of $17.3 million.\n“During the first quarter of 2018, we focused on our objectives of operating a healthy core business, driving profitable growth and aggressively transforming our business,” commented Josh Marks, CEO of Global Eagle. “We continue to expect a minimum of 25% Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2018 versus 2017. Looking forward to the third quarter of 2018, we are excited to activate aircraft from our recent new wins onto what is already the largest network of Ku-connected, single-aisle aircraft in the world.”\nGlobal Eagle is building upon its market-leading, connected aircraft solution. Our unique solution combines high-speed gate-to-gate internet connectivity with connectivity-enabled content, data analytics, and our powerful portal for short- and medium- haul fleets. It has a proven track record of demonstrating the highest levels of reliability and elevating the on-board passenger experience, all while minimizing the risk to the airline of technological obsolescence.\n“An integral part of transforming our business is further integrating our prior acquisitions, which will improve our ability to meet our customers’ needs and streamline our cost structure,” said Paul Rainey, CFO of Global Eagle. “We continue to expect these actions to positively impact our operating expenses in the second quarter of 2018 and to build throughout the year.”\nFirst Quarter Summary\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $156 million, a 2.6% increase over the prior-year period. This increase was primarily driven by growth in service revenue in our Connectivity segment due to new aircraft, vessel and site additions, as well as increased equipment revenue. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $38.3 million. The smaller net loss over the prior-year period was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment in the first quarter of 2017 that did not recur in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $78 million related to its Maritime & Land business unit within its Connectivity segment. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $17.3 million, which was a slight increase over the prior-year period, primarily due to growth in our Connectivity segment’s service revenue and equipment revenue, which included higher margin sales of spare parts.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Global Eagle implemented a new accounting standard, “ ASC 606—Revenue from Contracts with Customers .” The impact of applying the new standard for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was a decrease in revenue of $0.7 million, a decrease in cost of goods sold of $0.4 million and an immaterial adverse impact on net income and Adjusted EBITDA. We recommend that you review the disclosures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for our first quarter of 2018 for additional information regarding the impact of ASC 606.\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the recent Searchlight Capital Partners investment to repay the $78 million principal balance on the Company's revolving credit facility. The full $85 million facility (reduced for approximately $6 million in outstanding letters of credit) remains available to the Company. The Company anticipates using the remaining proceeds for growth initiatives and other general corporate purposes.\nWebcast\nGlobal Eagle will host a live webcast on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2:00 p.m. PDT). The Company will make the webcast available on the Investor Relations section of its website at http://investors.geemedia.com/events.cfm . An archive of the webcast replay will be on its website for 30 days following the event.\nAbout Global Eagle\nGlobal Eagle is a leading provider of media, content, connectivity and data analytics to markets across air, sea and land.

The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other measures of our cash flows or liquidity. Further, we note that Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein is defined and calculated differently than the “Consolidated EBITDA” definition in our senior secured credit agreement and in our second lien notes, which Consolidated EBITDA definition we use for financial-covenant-compliance purposes and as a measure of our liquidity. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable measure under GAAP, please see the table entitled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measure” at the end of this release.\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our financial performance and operating trends, including period to period comparisons, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long term operational plans. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures used by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to establish the funding targets for (and subsequent funding of) our Annual Incentive Plan bonuses for our employees and executive officers. We believe our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors both because it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and because our management frequently uses it in discussions with investors, commercial bankers, securities analysts and other users of our financial statements.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before (a) interest expense (income), (b) income tax expense (benefit) and (c) depreciation and amortization (including relating to equity-method investments) and (gain) loss on disposal and impairment of fixed assets, and we then further adjust that result to exclude (when applicable in the period) (1) change in fair value of financial instruments, (2) other (income) expense, including primarily, (gains) losses from investments and foreign-currency-transaction (gains) losses, (3) goodwill impairment expense, (4) stock-based compensation expense, (5) strategic-transaction, integration and realignment expenses (as described below), (6) auditor and third-party professional fees and expenses related to our internal-control deficiencies (and the remediation thereof) and complications in our audit process relating to our control environment, (7) excess content expenses (as described below), (8) securities class-action expenses (as described below), (9) losses on significant customer bankruptcies (as described below) and (10) restructuring expenses pursuant to our September 2014 integration plan. Management does not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating results.\n“Excess content expenses” includes the additional purchasing costs that we incurred in 2017 to procure movie content for our customers, notwithstanding that we could have procured equivalent content under our (preferential-pricing) output arrangements with major studios. We incurred these additional costs because we could not timely identify and measure our movie-content expenditures and procurement during the period due to weaknesses in our control environment.\n“Losses on significant customer bankruptcies” includes (1) our provision for bad debt associated with the bankruptcies of Air Berlin and Alitalia (two of our Media & Content customers) in 2017, together with (2) the costs ( e.g ., content acquisition fees) that we incurred to maintain service to those customers during their bankruptcy proceedings in order to preserve the customer relationship.\n“Securities class-action expenses” includes third-party professional fees and expenses associated with the securities class-action lawsuits filed against us in 2017.\n“Strategic-transaction, integration and realignment expenses” includes (1) transaction-related expenses and costs (including third-party professional fees) attributable to acquisition, financing, investment and other strategic-transaction activities, (2) integration and realignment expenses and allowances, (3) employee-severance, retention and relocation expenses, (4) purchase-accounting adjustments for deferred revenue, costs and credits associated with companies and businesses that we have acquired through our M&A activities, (5) service-level-agreement penalties incurred during our Eagle-1 migration and setup in its new orbital slot in 2017, and (6) claims at companies or businesses that we acquired through our M&A activities for underlying liabilities that pre-dated our acquisition of those companies or businesses. In respect of clause (6) in this definition, we include ( i.e ., exclude from net income (loss)) any estimated loss contingencies and provisions for legal settlements relating to those liabilities.\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
