He was also a member of the now seven-strong senior executive committee that leads Richemont, which has abolished the role of group CEO.\n“I presume Richemont will leverage Yoox Net-a-Porter’s expertise to scale and internationalise its online and multichannel platforms, which was something Van Oosten was originally hired for,” Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said.\nLuxury goods manufacturers have only belatedly pursued online growth, with many brands initially wary of an e-commerce world which they believed might make their products seem less exclusive.\nBut most are now playing catch-up, either building out their own websites where they can tightly control their image, or collaborating with third-parties sites such as Farfetch and MatchesFashion.\nFrance’s LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, opted to develop its own multi-brand platform, 24 Sevres, in one of its most eye-catching initiatives since hiring former Apple music executive Ian Rogers in 2015 as digital chief.\nYNAP said in April it was launching a dedicated section for the sale of high-end jewellery - one of Richemont’s fortes.\nOne challenge for the two groups as YNAP moves in-house will be to hold onto other clients that collaborate with the platform.\n$1 = 0.8353 euros Reporting by Michael Shields and Silke Koltrowitz in Zurich and Sarah White in Paris; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:11:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
