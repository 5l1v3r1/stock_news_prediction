It felt pretty good out there today.”\nFitzpatrick saved par on the last with a chip and a putt after hitting his ball into the water.\nBland, whose best career result came at Wentworth in 2006 when he was fifth, made six birdies during his round, dropping one shot at the par-four sixth.\n“I know the results are not showing it but I felt It was trending back in the right direction,” Bland said after shooting his lowest score in 29 rounds at Wentworth.\n“It’s just nice to finally see something red for the hours you’ve put in on the range.”\nNorthern Ireland’s former Open champion Darren Clarke pulled out late on after injuring his ankle the day before.
