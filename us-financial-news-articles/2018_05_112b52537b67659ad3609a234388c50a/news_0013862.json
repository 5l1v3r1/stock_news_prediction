This was less than $4.609 billion they bought at the seven-year auction in March.\nWhile foreigners have pulled back their Treasuries purchases, domestic fund managers stepped up their buying of these Treasury maturities to their highest levels since September.\nIn late April, investment managers bought $13.930 billion of two-year notes, $19.569 billion in 5-year notes and $18.074 billion in 7-year debt, Treasury data showed.
