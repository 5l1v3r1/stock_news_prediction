However, school attendance is not compulsory, meaning parents have a right to choose how to educate their children.\nDanish parents living in the designated areas will also be forced to enroll their children in the initiative, although those already receiving daycare will not be required to join.\nWhile the primary focus will be on language skills and learning readiness, the deal also seeks to educate the primarily Muslim children in Danish traditions and Christian holidays including Christmas and Easter.\nIf parents fail to enroll their children they could lose their child benefits, the government said.\nThe amount of non-Western immigrants in the “ghetto” areas was 66.5 percent in 2017, according to the Danish ministry of housing. Non-western immigrants make up 8.7 percent of Denmark’s 5.7 million population.\nDenmark is the only country in the world to officially describe certain residential areas as “ghettos”, a term originated in sixteenth century Venice to describe areas of the city to which Jews were restricted.\nThe agreement was reached by a majority in parliament, where the government is led by The Liberal Party and supported by the nationalist Danish People’s Party.\nOpposition party The Social Democratic Party, which in recent years like many other European social democrats has taken a harder stance towards Middle Eastern immigrants, also supported the deal.\nReporting by Emil Gjerding Nielson; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T17:34:49.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
