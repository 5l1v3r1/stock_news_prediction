He gave up six hits and two walks while striking out four.\nMinor allowed three runs and seven hits in his six innings. He walked three and struck out four.\nOne of the hits Minor allowed was Betts’ fourth home run in the last two games. The solo shot in the second inning was his American League-leading 12th of the season.\nMazara finished with five RBIs, one shy of his career best, helping the Rangers win for just the second time in five games.\nMazara, DeShields, Choo and Chirinos had two hits apiece for Texas, while DeShields and Profar scored twice each.\nThe Rangers out-hit the Red Sox 11-9.\nBetts added a sacrifice fly and two-run double to complete a four-RBI game. J.D. Martinez and Christian Vazquez added two hits each for the Red Sox.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:06:29.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
