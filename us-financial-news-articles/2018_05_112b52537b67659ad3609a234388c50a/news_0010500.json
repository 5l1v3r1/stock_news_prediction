(NASDAQ:TTMI), a leading global printed circuit board (“PCB”) manufacturer, today reported results for fiscal 2018, which ended April 2nd, 2018. The financial results provided below for the first quarter do not include any contribution from the acquisition of Anaren, Inc. (“Anaren”), which was completed on April 18 th , 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet sales were $663.6 million GAAP net income was $10.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share Non-GAAP net income was $28.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share Completed the acquisition of Anaren, Inc.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet sales for 2018 were $663.6 million, compared to $625.2 million in 2017 and $739.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP operating income for 2018 was $30.0 million, compared to $52.6 million in 2017 and $71.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net income for 2018 was $10.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. This compares to $33.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in 2017 and $49.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income for 2018 was $28.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $39.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for 2017 and $61.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2018 was $83.2 million, or 12.5 percent of net sales, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $95.6 million, or 15.3 percent of net sales, for 2017 and $121.7 million, or 16.5 percent of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“As anticipated, we faced seasonal challenges in our consumer related cellular and computing markets in the first quarter resulting in expected short term pressure on margins,” said Tom Edman, CEO of TTM. “We were pleased to see solid growth from the aerospace and defense and automotive end markets that more than offset weakness in our computing and networking markets. We also closed the acquisition of Anaren in the second quarter, which we expect will further increase our exposure to the growing aerospace and defense end market and strengthen our ability to deliver value added solutions to our customers across all of the markets we serve.”\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, including the expected contribution from Anaren post acquisition, TTM estimates that revenue will be in the range of $700 million to $750 million, and non-GAAP net income will be in the range of $0.34 to $0.40 per diluted share.\nTo Access the Live Webcast/Conference Call\nTTM will host a conference call and webcast to discuss first quarter 2018 results and second quarter 2018 outlook on Wednesday, May 2nd, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time).

TTM cautions you that such statements are simply predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. These statements reflect TTM's current expectations, and TTM does not undertake to update or revise these forward looking statements, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in this or other TTM statements will not be realized. Further, these statements involve risks beyond TTM's control, which could cause actual results to the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, including interest rates, currency exchange rates and consumer spending, demand for TTM's products, market pressures on prices of TTM's products, warranty claims, changes in product mix, contemplated significant capital expenditures and related financing requirements, TTM's dependence upon a small number of customers and other factors set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of the Company's public reports filed with the SEC.\nAbout Our\nThis release includes information about TTM’s adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, all of which are non- . TTM presents non-GAAP financial information to enable investors to see TTM through the eyes of management and to provide better insight into TTM’s ongoing financial performance.\nA material limitation associated with the use of the above non- is that they have no standardized measurement prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar non- used by other companies. TTM compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. However, the non- should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWith respect to the Company’s outlook for non-GAAP net income per diluted share, we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty or without unreasonable effort certain items that may affect such measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our expected non-GAAP net income per diluted share excludes primarily the future impact of restructuring actions, impairment charges, unusual gains and losses, and tax adjustments. These reconciling items are highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control and could have a material impact on our future period net income per diluted share calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income per diluted share to such measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is not available without unreasonable effort and has not been provided.\n- Tables Follow -\nTTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Management believes that both measures -- which add back amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense on debt (before consideration of capitalized interest), gain on sale of assets, acquisition-related costs, asset impairments, restructuring and other charges as well as the associated tax impact of these charges and discrete tax items -- provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Company's ongoing financial condition and results of operations. 5 Income tax adjustments reflect the difference between income taxes based on a non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate. 6 Non-GAAP diluted number of shares used in computing non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to stockholders excludes the dilutive effect of convertible debt. 7 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, gain on sale of assets, acquisition-related costs, asset impairments, restructuring and other charges. We present adjusted EBITDA to enhance the understanding of our operating results, and it is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations. In addition, we provide our adjusted EBITDA because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements. However, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
