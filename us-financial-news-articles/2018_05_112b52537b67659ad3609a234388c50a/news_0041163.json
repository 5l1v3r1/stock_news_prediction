Brill, whom tabloids dubbed “The Man Who Ate Manhattan” and who still heads the hunts, showed the world how ubiquitous wild plants are and since then foraging has increasingly gained a hip, trendy appeal.\nMany U.S. national parks have no-foraging rules but make exceptions for certain abundant foods, such as cactus pears in Arizona's Casa Grande Ruins National Monument and berries at Cape Cod National Seashore. reut.rs/2L6CQ7U\nDepending on the time of year and location, sharp-eyed gatherers may fill their baskets with sheep sorrel, a lemony vegetable that looks vaguely like a sheep’s head, lady’s thumb, whose pink petals are used for tea, or linden tree blossoms, which makes a beverage prized as a natural tranquilizer.\nWild delicacies can be dangerous, however, with 6,000 Americans poisoned each year by mushrooms alone. reut.rs/2rPQ8wS (Reporting by Elly Park; Writing by Barbara Goldberg)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://reut.rs/2L6CQ7U", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://reut.rs/2rPQ8wS", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:33:33.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
