As early as last year, when French euroskeptic leader Marine Le Pen gained support in the polls, French bonds switched back to ape Italian ones .\nBut now, with Italy’s new antiestablishment parties once again posing a direct challenge to the euro, French and Belgian bonds are clearly tracking German ones, correlations between daily bond moves show—even though spreads have widened because German debt has rallied even faster.\nShare this: eurozone Italy Macron Previous Brexit & Beyond: Eurozone Crisis Fears Revived Next WSJ City PM: Eurozone Risk Aversion Is Back, Why Bank Investors Fear Return of Doom Loop", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:00:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
