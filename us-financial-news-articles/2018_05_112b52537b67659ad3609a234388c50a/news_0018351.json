I will not give up.”\nNew Zealand-born Cooper played his last test off the bench against Italy in Brisbane last June.\nBehind incumbent Bernard Foley, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has few specialist flyhalves to choose from in Super Rugby and none with Cooper’s international experience.\nHowever Cheika, who is preparing to name a squad for the three-match series against Ireland in June, may elect to have regular inside centre Kurtley Beale back up at flyhalf, while Reece Hodge also played at 10 in last year’s test against Japan.
