The purchase of the water and wastewater systems adds approximately 1,415 new wastewater customers and approximately 475 water customers to the Company’s customer base.\nThe Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) approved the sale for $2 million on May 2, 2018. Today, Illinois American Water acquired the water and wastewater systems.\nAccording to Brad Spurgeon, Vice President of Sundale Utilities, Inc., significant investment needs coupled with his retirement led to the decision to sell the systems. He said, “Over 60 years ago when the utility systems were created, there was a great need for water and sewer infrastructure in Washington Estates and for a sewer system in the Sundale area. This need is stronger today than ever before.”\nHe explained, “Guidelines have become more stringent and the investment needed to remain in compliance has grown beyond our capacity. A benefit of selling the systems to Illinois American Water is knowing they will make the critical investment needed and will care for our customers as we have over the years.”\nIllinois American Water plans to invest an estimated $4.4 million over the first five years of ownership. This investment includes security and safety improvements including improved chemical storage and electrical upgrades for reliability. The Company will also complete a hydraulic study to ensure critical water pressure for service and fire protection. Water mains and water meters will also be replaced and upgraded. Additional wastewater improvements include installing a new aeration system, sewer main lining and overall system rehab for reliability and safety.\n“Systems across the nation are facing incredible investment needs for public health and safety. We are committed to upgrading these systems and ensuring quality water and reliable wastewater service to our new customers,” said Roger Goodson, sr. manager of field operations and production for Illinois American Water’s Peoria District.\nNew customers will soon receive an Illinois American Water welcome packet in the mail. This packet includes information about online account management, billing, payment options and more.\nThe appraisal process used for the Sundale Utilities, Inc. water and wastewater systems was conducted under the supervision of the ICC and established as part of the Illinois Water Systems Viability Act.
