Three Mile Island is in Pennsylvania, and Dresden and Byron are in Illinois.\nExelon said the results “underscore the urgent need for policy reforms to resolve acknowledged flaws in market rules that fail to properly value the resilient, zero-emissions power provided by nuclear plants.”\nThis marks the fourth consecutive year that Three Mile Island has failed to clear in the PJM auction. Exelon has said it plans to shut Three Mile Island in October 2019.\nAcross all of PJM, 10,643 megawatts of nuclear capacity did not clear in the auction, compared with 3,243 MW that failed to clear last year, Exelon said. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes.\nThat is the largest volume of nuclear capacity ever not selected in the auction, Exelon said.\nPJM, the biggest U.S. power grid, operates the system in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois.
