View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515005491/en/\nJeremy is a well-known figure in Oil & Gas with over 15 years of experience. He joins OspreyData from Capgemini, where he served as Operational Technology Practice Leader, delivering value where IT and OT meet. He previously served as Executive VP of Sales and Field Operations at WellAware, focusing on real-time data solutions and optimization analytics for the Upstream and Midstream sectors. Before that, Jeremy spent the previous five years leading the sales team of CygNet Software to become the North America market leader in onshore SCADA installations and also Weatherford’s Production Optimization business units with a portfolio of over 500,000 wells. At OspreyData, he will focus on all aspects of the customer experience from client acquisition through implementation and support by matching its predictive platform with companies ready to transition into data-driven operations.\nBarrett is equally well-known in the industry with over 15 years of experience. He last served as Energy Solutions Consultant at Capgemini, helping customers leverage their data-collection investments with the proper analytics tools. He also holds experience at WellAware, serving as Product Manager in their software division. At Cygnet, Barrett led the Product Advisor team, selling both CygNet and Weatherford’s suite of Production Optimization tools.

Their expertise will be instrumental at this stage where we have real momentum in the market. All of our customers and prospects acknowledge they need to adapt in this area and their current systems are not capable of delivering predictive and optimization insights essential for improving production and lowering costs. We are investing in this momentum as there is not a better technology or company capable of answering this demand more than OspreyData.”\nAbout OspreyData\nOspreyData is the first software platform to bring Expert-Augmented Machine Learning to the E&P space within Oil & Gas.
