(NASDAQ:RMBS) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 under the newly adopted GAAP Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606” or “New Revenue Accounting Standard”), which superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”) that was previously applicable. Total revenue for the quarter under ASC 606 was $46.4 million, with GAAP diluted net loss per share of $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net loss per share of $0.10.\nRambus also reported financial results as they would have been presented under ASC 605. This ASC 605 presentation is required under the modified retrospective transition method that Rambus has chosen to adopt under ASC 606. Rambus notes that this presentation allows a more relevant comparability with prior results, which were all reported under ASC 605. Total revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 under ASC 605 would have been $100.5 million, 4% higher than a year ago excluding the impact of the Lighting Division, with GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.05 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.21.\n“We delivered a solid first quarter and are making strong progress across all of our businesses as we maintain our growth trajectory, making data faster and safer for the data center and mobile edge markets,” said Dr. Ron Black, chief executive officer of Rambus. “We continue to gain traction with our products, services and licensing, while expanding partnerships with industry leaders to extend our reach to new technologies and market segments.”\nBusiness Review\nWe had a very positive quarter in our Memory and Interfaces Division, with ongoing customer traction for our DIMM buffer chipset and record revenue for IP cores. We increased our market footprint for our DDR4 memory buffer chipset with further OEM and cloud customer qualifications leading to more design wins at our key customers. As we look to the next-generation, we maintain our leadership position, leveraging our head start in learnings for DDR5 memory buffer chips as the first and only supplier with working silicon for both the RCD and DB chips. For IP cores, we continue to grow our portfolio with new technologies and expand to new market segments. With the launch of our new GDDR6 memory PHY as part of a comprehensive solution alongside ecosystem partners Micron, Norwest Logic and Avery Design, we are the first IP supplier to offer a broadly available GGDR6 PHY and closed our first major design win for non-graphics applications.\nOur Security Division, which consists of our Cryptography, Ticketing and Payments groups, had a solid quarter with the Cryptography team launching the CryptoManager Root of Trust core. Representing the next-generation of programmable secure processing, the core features a RISC-V CPU that has been customized by our security experts to go beyond a secure vault and enable the siloed execution of secure code within the core to help protect against vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre. In addition, we expanded our DPA licensing program, signing agreements with Gemalto and Beijing Tongfang Microelectronics, our first licensee in China, to protect against side-channel attacks. Our Ticketing group remains a market leader in smart ticketing with ongoing deployments of our back-office software and services to train and bus operators across the UK. The Payments team continues to see ongoing traction for tokenization solutions for card payments and beyond with world-wide implementations of our Token Service Provider software and ongoing customer engagements for the Unified Payment Platform.\nLastly, as we look to further our innovation and IP development from our Emerging Solutions Division, we announced a partnership with IBM to develop hybrid memory system architectures for future data centers. As part of the collaboration, we will develop an architecture that combines the best attributes of DRAM and storage class memory to create a high-capacity solution at lower cost per bit, with performance levels comparable to that of DRAM.\nFinancial Review - GAAP Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions, except for percentages and per share amounts) 2018 2017 As Reported\nASC 606\nAdjustments\n(1)\nASC 605 (1)\nAs Reported\nASC 605\nRevenue Royalties $ 21.4 $ 55.8 $ 77.2 $ 69.0 Product revenue 7.3 0.3 7.6 10.9 Contract and other revenue 17.7 (2.0 ) 15.7 17.5 Total revenue $ 46.4 $ 54.1 $ 100.5 $ 97.4 Total operating costs and expenses $ 90.0 $ — $ 90.0 $ 84.0 Operating income (loss) $ (43.6 ) $ 54.1 $ 10.5 $ 13.4 Operating margin (94 )%\n104 % 10 % 14 % Net income (loss) $ (38.9 ) $ 45.0 $ 6.1 $ 3.0 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ (0.36 ) $ 0.41 $ 0.05 $ 0.03 Licensing billings (1) $ 75.9 $ — $ 75.9 $ 68.6 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16.5 $ — $ 16.5 $ 17.2 (1) As noted above, Rambus is presenting the ASC 606 results together with the adjustments made to reconcile the ASC 606 presentation to the results that would have been applicable under ASC 605.

Note that the applicable non-GAAP measures are presented and that revenue is solely presented on a GAAP basis. (2) See note (1) under “Financial Review-GAAP” above for a description of the Adjustments and ASC 605 presentations. Revenue for the quarter was $46.4 million. Revenue under ASC 605 would have been $100.5 million. Revenue was in line with our expectations, and included $2.5 million from our Lighting Division which was wound down in the first quarter of 2018. GAAP total operating costs and expenses of $90.0 million and non-GAAP total operating costs and expenses of $68.7 million included expenses from our Lighting Division for the quarter. We also had $0.36 of GAAP diluted net loss per share and $0.10 of non-GAAP diluted net loss per share. Total GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share under ASC 605 would have been $0.05 and $0.21, respectively, and were in line with our expectations.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31, 2018 were $291.2 million, a decrease of $38.2 million from December 31, 2017, mainly due to $50 million paid in connection with an accelerated share repurchase program, offset by cash generated from operating activities of approximately $16.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA under ASC 605 for the quarter would have been $34.7 million.\n2018 Second Quarter Outlook\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 which materially impacted the timing of revenue recognition for the Company's fixed-fee intellectual property licensing arrangements. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Company's other revenue streams, net cash provided by operating activities, or its underlying financial position.\nThe Company has provided its second quarter outlook under ASC 606 and ASC 605 in order to provide additional transparency. The Company believes that providing this additional disclosure in the short term will help its investors and analysts understand the impact of the change in revenue recognition standards, especially given the material difference in the timing of revenue recognition for its fixed-fee licensing arrangements as mentioned above. Note that the presentation under ASC 605 is not a substitute for the new ASC 606 revenue recognition rules under current GAAP.\n2018 Second Quarter Outlook (ASC 606) (In millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Non-GAAP (1) Revenue $42 - $48 $42 - $48 Total operating costs and expenses $87 - $83 $68 - $64 Operating loss $45 - $35 $26 - $16 Diluted net loss per share $0.35 - $0.28 $0.20 - $0.13 (1) See “Reconciliation of GAAP Forward Looking Estimates to Non-GAAP Forward Looking Estimates” tables included below. Note that the applicable non-GAAP measures are presented and that revenue is solely presented on a GAAP basis. For the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects revenue under ASC 606 to be between $42 million and $48 million. Revenue is not without risk and achieving revenue in this range will require that the Company sign customer agreements for patent licensing, various product sales, mobile payments software and solutions licensing among other matters.\nThe Company also expects operating costs and expenses to be between $87 million and $83 million, and diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.28. Additionally, the Company expects non-GAAP operating costs and expenses to be between $68 million and $64 million, and non-GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.20 and $0.13. These expectations also assume non-GAAP interest and other income and expense of $2 million, tax rate of 24% (refer to non-GAAP financial information below - income tax adjustments) and diluted share count of 107 million, and exclude stock-based compensation expense ($8 million), amortization expense ($11 million), and non-cash interest expense on convertible notes ($3 million).\n2018 Second Quarter Outlook (ASC 605) (In millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Non-GAAP (1) Revenue $94 - $100 $94 - $100 Total operating costs and expenses $87 - $83 $68 - $64 Operating income $8 - $18 $26 - $36 Diluted net income per share $0.02 - $0.09 $0.17 - $0.23 (1) See “Reconciliation of GAAP Forward Looking Estimates to Non-GAAP Forward Looking Estimates” tables included below. Note that the applicable non-GAAP measures are presented and that revenue is solely presented on a GAAP basis. For the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects that revenue under ASC 605 would be between $94 million and $100 million. Revenue is not without risk and achieving revenue in this range will require that the Company sign customer agreements for patent licensing, various product sales, mobile payments software and solutions licensing among other matters.\nThe Company also expects that operating costs and expenses would be between $87 million and $83 million, and diluted net income per share would be between $0.02 and $0.09. Additionally, the Company expects that non-GAAP operating costs and expenses would be between $68 million and $64 million, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share would be between $0.17 and $0.23. These expectations also assume non-GAAP interest and other income and expense of $2 million, tax rate of 24% (refer to non-GAAP financial information below - income tax adjustments) and diluted share count of 111 million, and exclude stock-based compensation expense ($8 million), amortization expense ($11 million), and non-cash interest expense on convertible notes ($3 million).\nConference Call:\nRambus management will discuss the results of the quarter during a conference call scheduled for 2:00pm PT today. The call, audio and slides will be available online at investor.rambus.com and a replay will be available for the next week at the following numbers: (855) 859-2056 (domestic) or (404) 537-3406 (international) with ID#9392458.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information:\nIn the commentary set forth above and in the financial statements included in this earnings release, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures: operating costs and expenses, operating margin, operating income (loss), net income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share, presented both under ASC 606 and as they would have been presented under ASC 605. In computing each of these non-GAAP financial measures, the following items were considered as discussed below: stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related transaction costs and retention bonus expense, amortization expenses, non-cash interest expense and certain other one-time adjustments. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate for both its own assessment of, and to show investors, how the Company’s performance compares to other periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the financial statements contained in this release.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expense. These expenses primarily relate to employee stock options, employee stock purchase plans, and employee non-vested equity stock and non-vested stock units. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because such expenses are non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Additionally, given the fact that other companies may grant different amounts and types of equity awards and may use different option valuation assumptions, excluding stock-based compensation expense permits more accurate comparisons of the Company’s results with peer companies.\nAcquisition-related transaction costs and retention bonus expense. These expenses include all direct costs of certain acquisitions and the current periods’ portion of any retention bonus expense associated with the acquisitions. The Company excludes these expenses in order to provide better comparability between periods.\nRestructuring charges. These charges may consist of severance, contractual retention payments, exit costs and other charges and are excluded because such charges are not directly related to ongoing business results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses.\nAmortization expense. The Company incurs expenses for the amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. The Company excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Company’s prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company’s core business.\nNon-cash interest expense on convertible notes. The Company incurs non-cash interest expense related to its convertible notes. The Company excludes non-cash interest expense related to its convertible notes to provide more accurate comparisons of the Company’s results with other peer companies and to more accurately reflect the Company’s ongoing operations.\nIncome tax adjustments. For purposes of internal forecasting, planning and analyzing future periods that assume net income from operations, the Company estimates a fixed, long-term projected tax rate of approximately 24 percent for 2018 and 35 percent for 2017, which consists of estimated U.S. federal and state tax rates, and excludes tax rates associated with certain items such as withholding tax, tax credits, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the release of any deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Accordingly, the Company has applied these tax rates to its non-GAAP financial results for all periods in the relevant years to assist the Company’s planning. The Company has provided below a reconciliation of its GAAP provision for income taxes and GAAP effective tax rate to the assumed non-GAAP provision for income taxes and non-GAAP effective tax rate.\nOn occasion in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies that the Company may exclude in deriving its non-GAAP financial measures if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nAbout Rambus Inc.\nDedicated to making data faster and safer, Rambus creates innovative hardware, software and services that drive technology advancements from the data center to the mobile edge.
