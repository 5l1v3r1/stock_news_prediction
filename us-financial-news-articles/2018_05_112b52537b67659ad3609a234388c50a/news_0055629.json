REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\nSaft formed the alliance with European partners Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), Solvay ( SOLB.BR ) and Manz ( M5ZG.DE ) in February to research, develop and build a new generation solid-state battery to compete with Asian and U.S. manufacturers.\nThe level of funding from its partners is still to be decided, Saft told Reuters in response to questions. Slideshow (2 Images)\nThe company said part of its investment will come from internal funds and part, yet to be determined, will come from the European Union’s executive arm which has said it will support the development of a European battery sector.\nEurope is lagging rivals in the development of its own battery sector and European car makers have turned to dominant battery manufacturers in Asia such as Japan’s Panasonic Corp, South Korea’s Samsung SD and China’s BYD Co as demand for electric vehicles grows.\nSaft plans to develop a solid-state battery technology which can be competitive by 2025, with a battery that has twice the performance of those in the market today, the company said.\nIt plans to develop batteries with 5,000–10,000 (charge and re-charging) cycles, with more than 10 years usage for electric vehicles, and a 20-year calendar life.\n“The target is to demonstrate a prototype cell at lab level by the fourth quarter of 2019 and build up a 2 megawatt-hour (MWh) pilot line by Q4 2021,” it said.\nIf the project is successful, it will build a 1 gigawatt-hour manufacturing standard block by the fourth quarter of 2023, and develop larger scale production based on 2024 market demand, Saft said.
