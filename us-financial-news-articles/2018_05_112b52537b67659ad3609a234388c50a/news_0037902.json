REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nThe building has been in the news since Trump became president because of potential conflicts of interest. Jared Kushner stepped down as chief executive of Kushner Companies in January 2017, when his ownership stake was put in a trust.\nBrookfield would oversee a significant redevelopment of the building if a deal is reached, the source said. The Canadian controlled property owner has executed similar developments in New York and other cities around the world, the source said.\nTalks about the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue have included Chinese insurer Anbang Insurance Group and with a former Qatari prime minister.\nThe acquiring entity would be a Brookfield-managed private real estate fund, the source said. The Qatar Investment Authority would not be part of the fund or involved in the potential transaction.
