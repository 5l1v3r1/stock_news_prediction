REUTERS/Rafael Marchante ORGANIC GROWTH Europe’s airline market has seen significant consolidation over the last year. Lufthansa and easyJet both bought parts of failed Air Berlin last year, and more recently British Airways-owner IAG ( ICAG.L ) said it was interested in buying low-cost, long- and short-haul carrier Norwegian ( NWC.OL ).\nEasyJet has expressed an interested in Alitalia, but Lundgren said it did not want to buy any part of Norwegian.\n“We’re not interested in participating in any bidding in Norwegian. We have a great set of plans on our own,” he told reporters on a call.\n“Alitalia is the one that we have said publicly we’re engaging in discussion and that’s all we can say for now.”\nLooking to its future strategy, easyJet said it would invest more in its holidays business, with Lundgren positioning the company to take market share from his former employer, the tour operator TUI ( TUIT.L ), and its rival Thomas Cook ( TCG.L ).\nLundgren, who took over from Carolyn McCall in December, also said he would focus on attracting more business passengers and introducing an expanded loyalty program to deliver increased profit per seat from 2020.\n($1 = 0.7383 pounds)\nReporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Kate Holton and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:19:13.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
