In addition, the committee noted a “numerical increase in mortality-related events”, Genmab said in a statement.\n“While we are disappointed that the studies will be discontinued, Genmab fully supports Janssen’s decision as patient safety is paramount in drug development,” Genmab’s chief executive Jan van de Winkel said.\nBofA Merrill Lynch and Nordea downgraded Genmab shares to hold-equivalent ratings following the news.
