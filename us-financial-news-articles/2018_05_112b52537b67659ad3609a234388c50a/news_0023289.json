The three month net loss was $812,868, compared to a net loss of $1,117,582 for the third quarter last year. Diluted and basic loss per common share for the quarter was $0.11 compared to $0.15 for the three month period one year ago.\n\"Sales were soft in the third quarter as distributors in Europe significantly reduced their orders compared to the same period last year,\" Michael J. Koss Chairman and CEO said today. \"The decline in export sales was partially offset by stronger sales in the domestic market, driven by increased sales to mass retail. Despite these challenges, controlled spending allowed us to reduce the net loss compared to the third quarter last year.\"\nThe results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 also included a charge to earnings to write down the inventory value on a group of close-out products.\nSales for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, decreased 8.6% from $17,810,418 in the same period last year to $16,277,181 in the current year. The nine month net loss was $3,733,089 compared to $893,259 for the same period last year. Diluted and basic loss per common share was $0.51 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.12 for the same nine month period one year ago.\n\"Controlled spending has also reduced the loss before income tax for the first nine months compared to last year,\" Koss continued, \"but the write-down of deferred tax assets to the new federal statutory rate as well as an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the second quarter drove an increase in tax expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. This caused the increased net loss compared to the same nine month period one year ago.\"\nKoss Corporation markets a complete line of high-fidelity headphones, wireless Bluetooth® speakers, computer headsets, telecommunications headsets, active noise canceling headphones, wireless headphones, and compact disc recordings of American Symphony Orchestras on the Koss Classics® label.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
