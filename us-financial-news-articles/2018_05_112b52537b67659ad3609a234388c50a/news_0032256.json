The FTSE Ads Custom Saudi Minimum Variance Index was developed in collaboration with FTSE Russell.\n\"Saudi Arabia today is reforming, it is changing and generally investors who look at emerging markets, they look at emerging markets that are reforming, not the static emerging markets,\" Lemand told CNBC's \"Capital Connection.\" \"Today, Saudi Arabia is not only changing, it is literally transforming.\"\nIn 2016, Saudi Arabia's government unveiled a long-term economic blueprint for life in a low-oil-price world.\nTitled \"Saudi Vision 2030,\" the plan includes regulatory, budget and policy changes that will be implemented in the hope of making the kingdom less reliant on crude. It aims to build a \"prosperous and sustainable economic future\" for the kingdom.\nIn March, index compiler FTSE Russell decided to add Saudi Arabia to its emerging market index starting in March 2019, and index giant MSCI will decide whether to take the same action in June.\nCNBC's Matt Clinch and Reuters contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T09:44:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
