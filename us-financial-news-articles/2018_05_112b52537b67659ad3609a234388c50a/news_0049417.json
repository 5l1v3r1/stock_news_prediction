It said it was banning fresh produce, including mangoes, dates and bananas - the batsâ€™ preferred fruits.\nIndian health officials have not been able to trace the origin of the Nipah outbreak and have begun a fresh round of tests on fruit bats from Perambra, the suspected epicenter of the infection.\nKerala has sent 116 suspected cases for testing in recent weeks, 15 have been confirmed with the deadly disease and 13 of these people have died, with two patients still undergoing treatment.\nNo confirmed cases of the virus have been found outside the state.\nThere is no vaccine for the virus, which is spread through body fluids and can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\nLast week, the UAE consulate in Kerala advised travelers to take precautions and follow safety instructions issued by the Indian authorities.\nThe Gulf state has also banned imports of live animals from South Africa, based on a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) of the registration of Rift Valley Fever disease, the ministry said.
