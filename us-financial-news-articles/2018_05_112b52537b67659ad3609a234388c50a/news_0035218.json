Soccer Football - Premier League - Huddersfield Town vs Arsenal - John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield, Britain - May 13, 2018 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger before the match REUTERS/Peter Powell\nWenger watched his team beat Huddersfield Town 1-0 in their final game of the season and his last match in charge after nearly 22 years at the North London club.\nThe 68-year-old Frenchman reflected on his “human experiences” in his time at Arsenal on a day of mixed emotions, while he also spoke about his enjoyment of England and its football culture.\nYet when the prospect of managing another Premier League club against Arsenal was raised, Wenger said that scenario was unlikely.\n“I am not ready for that at the moment, that would be very difficult. I think on that day I would stay at home. I don’t know, at the moment, I don’t envisage that,” he said.

Maybe it is better I go somewhere else.” Slideshow (8 Images)\nWenger said he had fallen in love with England, which added to the impression that the Frenchman was saying goodbye to his adopted home, as well as his club.\n“I feel that I got a lot of respect not only from our fans but from England,” he said.\n“I would reiterate - I loved English football but as well I learned to love England over 22 years.\n“You don’t stay in a country like that if you don’t like it. It is a special country and special even for football, that is why I stayed such a long time,” he added.\n“It has changed me a lot - it is difficult to understand, when you don’t live in this country, how deep the love is for the game. It was a fantastic experience for me.”\nWhatever he does next, Wenger said it will be difficult to match the emotions he has experienced with Arsenal.\n“Where do I go from here? That is the difficulty, when you have experienced such intensity for such a long time,” he said. “It will be difficult. (But) even not managing the club, I will remain a fan of the club.” Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T21:58:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
