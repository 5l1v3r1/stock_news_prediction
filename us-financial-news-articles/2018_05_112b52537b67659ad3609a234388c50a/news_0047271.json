Wing Sylvian Mahuza was held up over the line, but Rohan Janse van Rensburg beat two tackles to level the scores.\nThe visitors were back in front just before the midway point of the first half as Kuridrani showed his strength to power his way over the tryline and ground the ball.\nAfter another penalty at the scrum in favour of the Lions, they set up an attacking lineout and once more it paid dividends as their first effort saw Arnold sent to the sin-bin for collapsing the maul and from the second, Coetzee was able to score as the home side’s powerful pack used their numerical advantage to good effect.\nThe Lions’ third try was mauled over by Dreyer to give the home side a 21-17 halftime lead.\nThe Brumbies hit the front again, though, when Banks scored his second try, breaking through some weak tackling from the hosts.\nIt was they who looked the most likely to go on and win the game at that point until Arnold’s moment of madness with 20 minutes remaining.\nThe Wallaby was sent from the field for a dangerously high tackle on Lions flyhalf Elton Jantjies, and looks likely to spend quite a few weeks on the sidelines for what was a dreadful piece of play.\nBrumbies were down to 13 a minute later when Carter was sent to the sin bin for collapsing a maul.\nSchoeman, Reynolds and Erasmus all then scored in the closing minutes as the Lions cantered home with superior numbers on the pitch.
