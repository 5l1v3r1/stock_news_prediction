First quarter 2018 operating income was $12.7 million compared to an operating loss of $9.9 million last year. Net income was $10.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share compared to a first quarter 2017 net loss of $7.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. Due to the lower corporate tax rate under the Tax Reform Act, first quarter 2018 net income reflects the impact of a $2.6 million reduction of income tax liabilities related to deferred income taxes established under GAAP. While GAAP requires the recognition of the Tax Reform Act impact on deferred taxes, the realization of those benefits is spread over many future years.\nExcluding certain items in both periods, as identified in the attached reconciliation tables, non-GAAP net income was $7.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in first quarter 2018 compared to a first quarter 2017 net loss of $5.9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $13.1 million in first quarter 2018 compared to a first quarter 2017 operating loss of $8.3 million.\n\"Strong market demand for our supply chain solutions and purposeful yield management contributed to our positive first quarter results,\" said Chairman, President & CEO Judy McReynolds. \"We are pleased that customers are finding value in our enhanced market approach and are utilizing us as a trusted partner for more of their logistics needs.\"\n1.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\n2.\nU.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\nAsset-Based\nResults of Operations\nFirst Quarter 2018 Versus First Quarter 2017\nRevenue of $482.1 million compared to $464.4 million, a per-day increase of 4.6 percent. Tonnage per day decrease of 3.7 percent. Shipments per day decrease 9.4 percent. Total billed revenue per hundredweight increased 8.9 percent and was positively impacted by Asset-Based pricing initiatives and higher fuel surcharges. Excluding fuel surcharge, the percentage increase on ArcBest's Asset-Based LTL freight was in the high-single digits. Operating income of $13.4 million and an operating ratio of 97.2 percent compared to an operating loss of $8.3 million and an operating ratio of 101.8 percent.\nYield management initiatives implemented throughout the last year continued to positively impact the Asset-Based business as significant improvements in revenue per hundredweight contributed to a better freight revenue mix and first quarter profitability. As general economic trends improved, ArcBest's Asset-Based business benefitted from increases in weight per shipment while actions to improve overall pricing resulted in significant increases in revenue per shipment. As seen in recent quarters, tonnage and shipment totals were below prior year levels, primarily related to the emphasis on improving account yields. In response to the lower shipment levels in the Asset-Based network, strict cost management and reductions in city cartage and city equipment rentals contributed to improved shipment profitability. Reductions in nonunion healthcare costs were another factor positively impacting first quarter Asset-Based financial results.\nAsset-Light ‡\nResults of Operations\nFirst Quarter 2018 Versus First Quarter 2017\nRevenue of $229.7 million compared to $193.1 million. Operating income of $4.7 million compared to operating income of $2.1 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $4.7 million compared to $2.9 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") of $8.4 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 million.\nThe increase in ArcBest's Asset-Light first quarter revenue was the result of solid revenue per shipment growth associated with tight industry supply and strong customer demand. The increase in Asset-Light revenue occurred despite reductions in daily shipments. Net revenue margins were compressed versus the prior year period as rising carrier costs, resulting from tight capacity in the marketplace, exceeded the rates paid by the customers being served. Although net revenue margins declined, an increase in net revenue dollars positively contributed to the improvement in Asset-Light operating income. At FleetNet, increased event count combined with labor and cost control contributed to growth in both revenue and profitability versus last year's first quarter.\nClosing Comments\n\"As expected, tighter capacity in first quarter resulted from the new Electronic Logging Mandate and other factors, and general economic trends were favorable,\" said McReynolds. \"We expect these trends to continue in 2018. These positive developments, combined with ArcBest's ability to offer full supply chain solutions, create a backdrop for us to push forward with many initiatives to continue improving our customer experience. In addition, we were pleased that a tentative contract agreement between ABF and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters was reached at the end of the first quarter, allowing our employees to continue focusing on exceeding customer needs.\"\nConference Call\nArcBest will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the 2018 first quarter results.

Other corporate costs also include additional investments to provide an improved platform for revenue growth and for offering ArcBest services across multiple operating segments.\nARCBEST CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures . We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, such as Adjusted EBITDA, utilized for internal analysis provide analysts, investors, and others the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance and provides meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Accordingly, using these measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because it removes the impact of items from operating results that, in management's opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of performance and for business planning. The measure is particularly meaningful for analysis of operating performance, because it excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and software of the Asset-Light businesses, which are significant expenses resulting from strategic decisions rather than core daily operations. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a primary component of the financial covenants contained in our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently; therefore, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures.
