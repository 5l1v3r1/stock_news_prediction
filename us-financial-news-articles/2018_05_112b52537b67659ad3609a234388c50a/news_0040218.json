Over the counter Argentine bonds rose an average 1.9 percent on Wednesday\n“I believe that the market gave a message to the central bank and the executive during the last weeks, which of course prompted us to reflect and to change some things,” central bank chief Federico Sturzenegger said during a presentation. “The market is saying ‘You need a different real exchange rate.’”\nArgentina’s current policy is a “dirty float,” in which the market determines the value of the local currency but the central bank intervenes in the spot market when it deems it to be necessary to calm volatility in the exchange rate.\nThe peso ended 0.78 percent weaker at 24.29 per U.S. dollar.\nDuring his presentation, the central bank chief said an exchange rate of 25 per dollar would be “out of scale”.\nArgentina requested a “high access stand-by arrangement” from the International Monetary Fund last week after the peso depreciated rapidly, prompting the central bank to sell reserves and hike interest rates to 40 percent.\nThe government earlier this month lowered its fiscal deficit goal in 2018 to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product from 3.2 percent previously, as part of its campaign to calm the markets. GOOD SIGNALS\nLate on Tuesday the central bank said it had raised interest rates on its short-term ‘Lebac’ securities to 40 percent from 26.3 percent in its monthly auction.\nThe monetary authority sold 620.930 billion pesos ($25.77 billion) in Lebacs, compared with the 615.877 billion pesos’ worth of securities that matured.\n“The local market is being pushed higher by the good signals that came yesterday,” local consultancy Portfolio Personal said in a note to clients.\nThe central bank said it sold $791 million in the spot market on Tuesday, when official data showed April consumer prices rose 2.7 percent, bringing 12-month inflation to a dizzying 25.5 percent.\n“Our focus is on the reduction of the inflation rate,” Sturzenegger said, adding that he believed May’s inflation rate would be “quite a bit” lower than April’s. “Disinflation is still present,” he said.\nThe central bank has about $53 billion in reserves, a level that Sturzenegger said he is “comfortable” with.\nArgentina is waiting to see what fiscal measures might be required by the IMF in exchange for the financing deal being negotiated in Washington. Fiscal belt tightening could be politically difficult for President Mauricio Macri after an outcry over his policy of cutting back utility subsidies.\n“The government won the battle, but not the war,” local economist Fausto Spotorno from consultancy Orlando Ferreres y Asociados tweeted.
