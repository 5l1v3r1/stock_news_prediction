The seized companies employed around 48,000 people, he said.\nAnkara blames the network of the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the attempted putsch. Gulen, who has lived in the United States since 1999, has denied the charges. His followers had been active in Turkish business, running companies spanning mining to financial services.\nTwo major construction groups, Dumankaya and Fi Yapi, halted building work on housing complexes after the companies were taken over by authorities.\nThe TMSF is now in talks with a German firm to take over those projects, Gulal said, without naming the company.\n“A Germany-based group has committed to complete unfinished housing projects. The talks are at the final stage, we will take action within 10 days,” he told a news conference in the central Turkish province of Kayseri.\nTurkish authorities have detained 160,000 since the failed coup and sacked a similar number of civil servants, according to a United Nations report this year.\nSeparately, Turkey will introduce steps to reduce a backlog of unsold homes, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Monday, in an attempt to fend off a decline in housing sales.\nThe plan would likely include reduction of interest rates on mortgage loans, banking sources said.\nConstruction has helped drive Turkey’s strong economic growth for years, but the industry has been hit by declining demand and the post-coup crackdown.\nTotal housing sales declined 14 percent in March, official data showed last month.
