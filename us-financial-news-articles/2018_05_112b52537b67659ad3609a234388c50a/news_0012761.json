The new coastal defense systems represent a significant addition to China's military portfolio in one of the most contested regions in the world.\nThe South China Sea, which is home to more than 200 specks of land, serves as a gateway to global sea routes where approximately $3.4 trillion of trade passes annually.\nThe numerous overlapping sovereign claims to islands, reefs and rocks — many of which disappear under high tide — have turned the waters into an armed camp. Beijing holds the lion's share of these features with approximately 27 outposts peppered throughout.\nThe United States has remained neutral – but expressed concern – about the overlapping sovereignty claims to the Spratlys.\n\"The biggest dilemma is that Beijing could over time deploy many more missiles than Washington's naval missile defense platforms could defend against,\" Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, told CNBC.\n\"At the end of the day, for Beijing, simple math means they would win a short-term military engagement and that spells all sorts of trouble for the U.S. Navy,\" he added.\nThe missile deployment is a sign that China will likely soon send warplanes to the area, too, according to an expert on the region .\n\"This should be seen as China crossing an important threshold. Missile platforms present a clear offensive threat,\" Gregory Poling, Center for Strategic and International Studies fellow and director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, told CNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T22:05:56.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
