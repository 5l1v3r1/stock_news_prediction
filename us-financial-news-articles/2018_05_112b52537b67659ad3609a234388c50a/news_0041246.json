This is Xerox’s second settlement with activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason; the company had earlier struck a deal with the two billionaires to oust Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson and flip the board, but that agreement abruptly expired earlier this month before receiving court approval.\nIf it remains in place, the new deal marks a win for Icahn and Deason, who agreed to table their proxy fight after several months of drama. They opposed the plan to combine with the joint venture Fuji Xerox, arguing it undervalued Xerox, and had planned to run their own slate of directors for Xerox’s board.\nNow, the new Xerox board will immediately begin examining strategic alternatives.\nAs part of the settlement, John Visentin will replace Jacobson as chief executive, the company said Sunday. Visentin is a former executive at several technology companies and had been working with the activist investors at Xerox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T02:56:24.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
