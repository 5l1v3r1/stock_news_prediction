Its gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans rose to 12.26 percent at end-March, from 11.31 percent three months earlier.\nIDBI Bank, which has the worst bad-loan ratio among all Indian lenders, said its ratio neared 28 percent at the end of March, leading to a net loss of 56.63 billion rupees ($834.8 million) - its sixth straight quarter of losses.\nIncluding Bank of Baroda and IDBI, 15 state banks have so far reported combined losses of 533.5 billion rupees ($7.9 billion) in the March quarter. Two have reported modest profits and four have yet to report results.\nTwenty one banks majority owned by the Indian government, which account for two-thirds of banking assets in the country, also hold close to 90 percent of soured loans.\nIDBI Bank will reduce its lending to corporate borrowers, which account for the bulk of its bad loans, and will instead focus on growing its retail loans, although that would mean the overall loan book could shrink, said Chief Executive M.K. Jain.\n“Most of the stress has already been recognised,” he told a news conference, outlining plans to sell about 214 billion rupees of bad loans to distressed asset buyers and raise as much as 40 billion rupees by selling non-core assets.\nThe bank will also shut unprofitable branches and curb its international presence among other measures to help it turn around its fortunes.\nBank Baroda Chief Executive P.S. Jayakumar said he expected the current financial year to be a “turning point” with expected recoveries from defaulters via the nascent bankruptcy court process.\nIDBI shares closed 3.1 percent lower after the results. Bank of Baroda shares ended 1.8 percent higher ahead of the results in a Mumbai market that closed 0.9 percent higher.
