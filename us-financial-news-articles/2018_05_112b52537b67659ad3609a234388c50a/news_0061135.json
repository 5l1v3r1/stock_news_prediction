There could actually be another price spike once the market realises what these quotas actually mean,” said the U.S.-based trader said.\nJefferies research says the premium for U.S. hot rolled coil versus a global basket was $255 a tonne in late April, more than twice the historical average of $117.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based think tank, says countries exempted from tariffs made up two-thirds of the 34.6 million tonnes worth of U.S. steel imports last year.\n“Assuming a quota system is implemented on select countries, supply-side constraints could develop (in certain products) in the second half as full year quotas are disproportionately utilised in the first half,” Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld said.\nThis would support U.S. steel prices, which have already surged some 80 percent since Trump announced his tariff investigation last year.\nIn the EU, where steel prices ST-MBEUDNHRC-MB ST-MBEDSHRC-MB have slipped some 4 percent this quarter after imports surged 8 percent last quarter, traders expect swift action to protect the domestic market.\nMarket sources say the world’s largest steel importer after the United States will impose ‘safeguard’ quotas on steel imports by the end of June or earlier, especially if the U.S. slaps quotas on EU steel.\nSafeguards are allowed under World Trade Organisation rules to defend against a sudden import surge. The EU wants to use them to protect against steel meant for the U.S. market ending up in the EU.\n“The problem is we don’t know how those quotas will be distributed so (we) don’t feel confident importing steel from outside the EU,” an EU-based steel trader said.\nThe EU said this week that even if European producers escape tariffs on June 1, they will likely face quotas. Poland said Washington wants a 10 pct cut on EU steel imports.
