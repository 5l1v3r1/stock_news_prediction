The 1.7 percent inflation expected in 2020 was in line with the ECB’s target, he said.\n“Some observers already see evidence of an approaching end to the upswing in the recent economic slowdown,” he told an audience in Mannheim, Germany. “However, I think such worries are exaggerated.”\nEchoing recent speeches, Weidmann backed expectations for the ECB to end its 2.55 trillion-euro ($3.05 trillion) money-printing program this year and raise rates for the first time since 2011 toward the middle of next year.\nRelated Coverage ECB must think of broader picture when deciding on banks: Angeloni He added the Federal Reserve experience in spelling out what steps it would take and in what order, was “very helpful” for the ECB.\nThe Fed said it would first begin raising rates and then start selling down the assets it had bought in its stimulus program - an order that financial analysts expect the ECB to follow.\n“The (ECB’s) Governing Council has so far seen no reason to correct that expectation but it has not committed to it,” Weidmann said.\nHe cautioned, however, that the ECB would not need to wait more than a year between the end of its bond purchases and its first rate hike - as the Fed did - because economic conditions are better in the euro zone.\n($1 = 0.8354 euros)\nReporting by Frank Siebelt; Writing by Francesco Canepa in Mannheim; editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T11:55:08.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
