Analysts had predicted earnings of 52 Canadian cents per share, according to Reuters data.\nThat boost was driven by better pricing and margins, though partially offset by higher operating costs on planned and unplanned maintenance, the company said.\nSuncor’s total upstream production fell 4.9 percent to 689,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), compared with 725,100 boe/d in the prior year quarter.\nOil sands production was 404,800 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 448,500 bpd, with cash operating costs per barrel jumping 19 percent to $26.85, from $22.55 in the year-ago quarter.\nNet earnings fell to C$789 million, or 48 Canadian cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, as a foreign exchange loss weighed. That compared with C$1.35 billion, or 81 Canadian cents per share a year earlier, when profit was boosted by an asset sale and a foreign exchange gain.\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Calgary; Editing by Leslie Adler and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T04:49:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
