He was a big idol of mine. It’s crazy to be competing against guys like that now.”\nThe win means Norrie will break into the top 100 when the latest ATP rankings are released next week.\nSimon struck 11 aces as he edged Kukushkin in two hours and 37 minutes.\nSerbia’s Dusan Lajovic beat American Taylor Fritz in 7-5 6-1 but will only discover his semi-final opponent on Friday after top seed Dominic Thiem’s quarter-final with Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez was suspended due to darkness.\nThiem, the only seed left in the draw, lost the first set tiebreak 7-6(4) but bounced back to win the second 7-6(0) in another tiebreak and level the match before play was suspended.
