Since the Black Fox mine was acquired on October 6, 2017, only gold production from the mine after this date was included in the 2017 total.\nThe table below provides financial highlights for the 2018, and comparative results from last year.\nFinancial Highlights\nQuarter Ended\nMar 31, 2017 Quarter Ended\nMar 31, 2018 Treasury Cash, Investments and Precious Metals ($ millions) (4) 55.1 55.4 Working Capital ($ millions) 58.3 39.3 Debt nil nil Earnings from Mining Operations (4) El Gallo Mine ($ millions) 8.2 12.4 San José Mine (49%) ($ millions) 5.7 3.5 Black Fox Mine ($ millions) - 3.1 Consolidated Net Income Net Income (Loss) ($ millions) (3.0 ) (5.2 ) Net Income (Loss) per Share ($) (0.01 ) (0.02 ) Cash Flow Net Cash Flow Provided (Used) in Operations ($ millions) (6.9 ) 11.0 Gold Bar Mine, USA (100%)\nDuring Q1 2018, construction activities at Gold Bar focused on finishing civil works related to the heap leach pad, ponds and site infrastructure, in preparation for major equipment and material deliveries in Q2 2018. Cumulative to date, we have capitalized $14.8 million to construction in progress relating to permitting, engineering, and site development activities. Construction is advancing on schedule for completion by the end of 2018. During the first three years of operation beginning in 2019 Gold Bar is projected to produce approximately 55,000, 74,000 and 68,000 ounces of gold respectively.\nEl Gallo Mine, Mexico (100%)\nDuring Q1 2018, the mine produced 12,217 GEOs, compared to 9,808 GEOs in 2017. Total cash costs and AISC were $691 and $753 per GEO, respectively. Production and cost guidance for 2018 are for 32,000 GEOs at a cash cost and AISC of $650 and $715 per GEO, respectively.\nMining from the existing open pits will cease in Q2 2018, while heap leaching activities are expected continue until 2020, or as long as it remains economical to do so. Operating expenses will begin to diminish significantly in Q2 2018, while gold production will decline more gradually, resulting in an overall reduction in cost per ounce produced for the balance of 2018.\nCurrently we are mining from the levels in the pits where the ores are transitioning from oxide to sulfide, and will soon be unsuitable for heap leach gold recovery. In order to treat the sulfide ores we would need to build a new treatment facility. Our exploration has been encountering encouraging grades in sulfide ores, and an assessment of how best to treat them is underway in conjunction with our work on the nearby El Gallo Silver Project. The results of our assessment will be released during Q2.\nBlack Fox Mine, Canada (100%)\nDuring Q1 2018, the mine produced 12,098 GEOs. Total cash costs and AISC were $849 and $1,188 per GEO, respectively. Production and cost guidance for 2018 are for 48,000 GEOs at a revised cash cost and AISC of $920 and $1,210 per GEO, respectively. Cash cost guidance is being revised down from $1,025 to $920 on a reclassification certain development expenditures that should be part of AISC and not cash costs.\nA $15 million exploration program is currently underway at the Black Fox Complex, please refer to the exploration results published on April 30, 2018 available on the McEwen Mining website www.mcewenmining.com .\nFor 2018, we have budgeted a total of $16.0 million for sustaining and capital expenditure activities at the Black Fox mine, from which we spent $4.1 million during the first quarter of 2018.\nSan José Mine, Argentina (49%)\nOur attributable production from San José in Q1 2018 was 10,822 gold ounces and 692,052 silver ounces, for a total of 20,049 GEOs. Total cash costs and AISC were $934 and $1,148 per GEO, respectively.\nDuring Q1, we received $4.9 million in dividends from our interest in San José, which compares to $2.5 million in dividends received during the same period in 2017. For 2018, we expect to continue to receive dividends in excess of $12 million, with the final amount being determined by the profitability, treasury position, and decisions on capital and exploration investments.\nLos Azules Project, Argentina (100%)\nFor the 2017-2018 exploration season at Los Azules, we have budgeted $5.3 million, of which we spent $3.2 million during Q1 2018. The activities performed were mainly technical and environmental base line monitoring work, to advance permitting efforts.\nShareholder Distributions\nDuring Q1 2018, the McEwen Mining paid a semi-annual return of capital distribution of $0.005 per share of common stock, for a total distribution of $1.7 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nWe invite you to join our conference call, where management will discuss our Q1 2018 financial results and project developments and follow with a question and answer session.

McEwen’s principal assets consist of: the San José mine in Santa Cruz, Argentina (49% interest); the El Gallo Gold mine in Mexico; the Black Fox mine in Timmins, Canada; the Gold Bar mine in Nevada, currently under construction; and the large Los Azules copper project in Argentina, advancing towards development.\nMcEwen has a total of 337 million shares outstanding. Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner, owns 24% of the shares.\nQUALIFIED PERSON\nThe technical contents of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Xavier Ochoa, Chief Operating Officer of McEwen Mining and a Qualified Person as defined by Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 \"Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\".\nRELIABILITY OF INFORMATION REGARDING SAN JOSÉ\nMinera Santa Cruz S.A., the owner of the San José Mine, is responsible for and has supplied to the Company all reported results from the San José Mine. McEwen Mining’s joint venture partner, a subsidiary of Hochschild Mining plc, and its affiliates other than MSC do not accept responsibility for the use of project data or the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING NON-GAAP MEASURES\nIn this report, we have provided information prepared or calculated according to U.S. GAAP, as well as provided some non-U.S. GAAP (\"non-GAAP\") performance measures. Because the non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nTotal Cash Costs and All-in Sustaining Costs\nTotal cash costs consist of mining, processing, on-site general and administrative costs, community and permitting costs related to current explorations, royalty costs, refining and treatment charges (for both doré and concentrate products), sales costs, export taxes and operational stripping costs. All-in sustaining cash costs consist of total cash costs (as described above), plus environmental rehabilitation costs, amortization of the asset retirement costs related to operating sites, sustaining exploration and development costs, and sustaining capital expenditures. In order to arrive at our consolidated all-in sustaining costs, we also include corporate general and administrative expenses. Depreciation is excluded from both total cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs. For both total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs we include our attributable share of total cash costs from operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, such as MSC, where we hold a 49% interest. Total cash cost and all-in sustaining cash cost per ounce sold are calculated on a co-product basis by dividing the respective proportionate share of the total cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs for the period attributable to each metal by the ounces of each respective metal sold. We use and report these measures to provide additional information regarding operational efficiencies both on a consolidated and an individual mine basis, and believe that these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about our underlying costs of operations. A reconciliation to the nearest U.S. GAAP measure is provided in McEwen Mining's Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the 2018.\nEarnings from mining operations\nThe term Earnings from Mining Operations used in this report is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use and report this measure because we believe it provides investors and analysts with a useful measure of the underlying earnings from our mining operations. We define Earnings from Mining Operations as Gold and Silver Revenues from our El Gallo Mine and our 49% attributable share of the San José Mine's Net Sales, less their respective Production Costs Applicable to Sales. To the extent that Production Costs Applicable to Sales may include depreciation and amortization expense related to the fair value increments on historical business acquisitions (fair value paid in excess of the carrying value of the underlying assets and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition), we deduct this expense in order to arrive at Production Costs Applicable to Sales that only include depreciation and amortization expense incurred at the mine-site level. The San José Mine Net Sales and Production Costs Applicable to Sales are presented, on a 100% basis, in Note 5 of McEwen Mining's Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the 2018.\nCash, investments and precious metals\nThe term cash, investments and precious metals used in this report is a non‑GAAP financial measure. We report this measure to better understand our liquidity in each reporting period. Cash, investments and precious metals is calculated as the sum of cash, investments and ounces of doré held in inventory, valued at the London P.M. Fix spot price at the corresponding period. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, Sales of Gold and Silver, is provided in McEwen Mining's Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the 2018.\nCAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis news release contains certain and information, including \" \" the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
