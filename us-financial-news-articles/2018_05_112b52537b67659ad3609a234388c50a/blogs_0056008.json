It is not just big, it's massive, stretching more than 320 feet. The boat ranks as No. 47 on the list of the largest yachts in the world. It weighs 4,600 metric tons, has a cruising speed of 14 knots and a top speed of 20 knots.

Lewis uses the yacht as his home away from home when he is not in New Providence, Bahamas. He has a net worth of $5 billion, according to Forbes. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Amenities\nThe yacht can sleep 12 with six cabins and has amenities such as a Jacuzzi (on deck), elevator, swimming platform, air conditioning, underwater lights, bathing platform, gym and piano. It also has its own speedboat. But if that was not enough, there is even a custom built indoor paddle tennis court in the hull of the ship to satisfy the owner's passion for the sport.
