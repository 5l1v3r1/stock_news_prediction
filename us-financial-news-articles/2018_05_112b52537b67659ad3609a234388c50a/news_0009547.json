In Paris, hundreds of masked and hooded anarchists smashed shop windows, torched cars and hurled cobblestones at riot police on Tuesday, hijacking a May Day rally by labour unions against President Emmanuel Macron’s economic reforms.

REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson FESTIVE AND DEFIANT\nTuesday’s Los Angeles turnout under cloudy skies and a slight drizzle was considerably diminished from the thousands who took to the streets of America’s second-largest city in 2017, for the first May Day celebration after Trump took office.\nBut the mood was festive and defiant, nevertheless.\n“No rain, no clouds, no hate, no division is going to keep workers from celebrating with immigrants, with refugees ... with the LGBT community, with the criminal justice reform community, with the environmental justice community,” union leader Laphonza Butler told the crowd, speaking from a flat-bed truck.\nButler heads the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 2015, representing some 380,000 long-term healthcare workers statewide, one of the largest collective bargaining units in the nation.\nBut marchers represented a broad cross-section of organised labour and other constituencies, from the Teamsters union and nurses to street vendors and a group called the Clean Carwash Campaign.\n“May First is a celebration of workers, and a lot of workers in this city are immigrants,” said Karla Cativo, 36, a community organizer with the Salvadoran American Leadership and Educational Fund, which provides services to Central American immigrants.
