However compared with the last quarter of 2017, net income from the bank’s core lending business rose 1.6 percent thanks to cheaper funding costs. Fees rose 12 percent.\nCost cutting, a key plank of the business plan underpinning the bailout, drove operating expenses down 12 percent quarter-on-quarter with a 9 percent drop from a year earlier.\nProvisions against loan losses more than halved from the start of last year to 137 million euros.\nThe bank, which on Thursday announced the completion of a landmark 24 billion euro bad loan sale, said it had kicked off a process to offload up to another 4.5 billion euros in impaired debts this year.\nEven after the jumbo disposal, gross soured loans will still account for nearly one fifth of total loans. That is roughly four times the European average and compares with the a best-in-class 6 percent ratio targeted by rival Intesa Sanpaolo .\nMonte dei Paschi said in slides on its website it saw potential to improve its soured loan target to 2021 to around 10 percent. It stands at 13 percent currently under its restructuring plan.\nDirect funding at the bank - which has suffered heavy deposit outflows in the past - was little changed in the quarter with an increase in current accounts offset by bonds maturing.
