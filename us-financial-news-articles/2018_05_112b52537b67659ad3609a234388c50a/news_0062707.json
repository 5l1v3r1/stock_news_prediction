Why should we be giving that away?” Craig Lindner, a private investor, told Corrie on the teleconference, adding he would be voting against the offer.\nSino Gas shares rose as much as 21 percent before easing to trade up 14 percent at A$0.24, suggesting investors don’t expect a higher bid to emerge. Its shares have strongly outperformed a flat ASX energy index .AXEJ this year, surging 35 percent to Wednesday’s close.\nShareholders are expected to vote on the offer, which needs approval from 75 percent of votes cast to proceed, in late August or September.\nLone Star made an unsuccessful $311 million bid two years ago for Australian gas producer AWE Ltd AWE.AX, which was taken over earlier this year by Japan’s Mitsui & Co for $470 million.\nReporting by Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
