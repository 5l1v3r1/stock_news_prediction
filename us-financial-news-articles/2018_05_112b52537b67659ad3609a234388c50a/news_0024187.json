The kuna eased to 7.395 to the euro from the level of around 7.375 where it was Quote: d before the intervention.\nThis was the second intervention by the central bank this year to relieve upward pressure on the kuna. At the beginning of January the central bank bought 405.5 million euros from commercial banks.\nMarket participants expect the firming pressure to persist in the coming period amid an inflow of euros due to the summer tourist season and the finance ministryâ€™s plan to borrow funds abroad to refinance a bond worth 750 million euros which matures in July.\nThe central bank keeps the kuna in a managed float regime, allowing it to fluctuate roughly at between 7.3 and 7.7 kuna to the euro.\nCroatia has a highly euroised economy and more than two thirds of its deposits are denominated in euros.\nLate last year Croatia started a process to adopt the euro, which the government expects to take up to seven years.
