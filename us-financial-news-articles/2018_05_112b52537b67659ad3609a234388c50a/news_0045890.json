Headline organic growth was 3.3 percent, bang in line with expectations,” said Exane BNP Paribas analysts, who kept a “neutral” rating on the stock.\n“No timeline (on UMG IPO) was provided but we think this is a long process and an IPO is unlikely to materialise this year (if at all),” added Exane BNP Paribas.\nVivendi also resumed hostilities over Telecom Italia on Thursday with a threat to call a new shareholder meeting to change the Italian company’s board, two weeks after it lost control to U.S. activist fund Elliott.
