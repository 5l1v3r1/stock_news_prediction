An index tracking major energy firms closed down 4.2 percent, with losses led by coal miners. ** China’s largest coal miner, China Shenhua, tumbled 7 percent in its worst day since early 2016, while Yanzhou Coal Mining plummeted the maximum allowed 10 percent. ** China’s state planner ordered utilities this week to stop stockpiling thermal coal and told miners to slash prices, two sources familiar with the matter said, the government’s first direct intervention to cool coal prices since mid-2016.\n** “The rally in coal prices has prompted the government to issue a flurry of measures to bring down prices,” said Zhang Min, a coal analyst with Sublime Information. ** Bucking the broad trend, China’s auto parts makers surged as Beijing said it will slash import tariffs for automobiles and car parts. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.52 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 1.18 percent . ** At 07:06 GMT, the yuan was Quote: d at 6.3817 per U.S. dollar, 0.26 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.3654. ** The largest percentage gainers on the main Shanghai Composite index were Guangdong Dcenti Auto-Parts Stock Ltd Co up 10.02 percent, followed by Guangdong Champion Asia Electronics Co Ltd gaining 10 percent and Changzhou Langbo Seal Polytron Technologies Co Ltd up by 10 percent. ** The largest percentage losers on the Shanghai index were Inly Media Co Ltd down 10.02 percent, followed by Yanzhou Coal Mining Co Ltd losing 9.95 percent and Hunan Salt Industry Co Ltd down by 8.1 percent. ** So far this year, the Shanghai stock index is down 4.2 percent, the CSI300 has fallen 4.4 percent, while China’s H-share index listed in Hong Kong is up 3.9 percent.
