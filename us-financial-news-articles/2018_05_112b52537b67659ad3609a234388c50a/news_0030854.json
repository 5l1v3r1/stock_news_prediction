This will determine how many permits will be withheld or added by the reserve in auctions for the 12-month period, running from September 2018 to August 2019.\nThe number of permits in circulation is based on supply since 2008, and the number of permits surrendered, canceled or held in reserve.\nReporting by Julia Fioretti and Nina Chestney in London; Editing by Robin Emmott and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:57:39.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
