(NYSE:DK) (“Delek US”) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Delek US reported first quarter net loss of $(34.9) million, or $(0.43) per basic share, versus net income of $11.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. On an adjusted basis, Delek US reported net income of $28.0 million, or $0.33 per basic share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This compares to adjusted net income of $10.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share on an adjusted basis in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") was $113.1 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $60.1 million in the prior year period. Reconciliations of net (loss) income reported under U.S. GAAP to adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA are included in the financial tables attached to this release.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, reported and adjusted results included a benefit of approximately $45.2 million before tax, or $0.42 per share after tax, from a combination of factors. This amount includes $79.8 million related to the net effect of the RINs waivers and mark-to-market adjustments, partially offset by operating factors that amounted to $34.6 million. These operating factors include an estimated lost profit opportunity of approximately $25.6 million related to lower operating performance and extended downtime in refining operations relative to the first quarter 2018 crude oil throughput guidance. During the downtime, the Company took the opportunity to perform additional work to debottleneck the crude tower at the Big Spring refinery, which should allow crude oil throughput to be near capacity going forward. In addition, there was a $9.0 million operating loss primarily from the combination of the West Coast asphalt operations, which are expected to be sold to a third party in the second quarter, and a West Coast supply and offtake agreement that is expiring in May 2018.\nUzi Yemin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delek US, stated, \"We are very excited about the activity in the Permian Basin. Our refining model is well positioned to benefit from the expected steep discount between WTI Cushing and WTI Midland crude oil for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. Based on the forward curve as of May 4, 2018, the discount is currently expected to average $5.86 per barrel for the second quarter, $14.00 per barrel for the second half of 2018 and $9.30 per barrel in 2019. With access to approximately 75.0 million barrels annually of Permian Basin crude oil in our refining system, or approximately 70 percent of our crude oil slate, Delek is the premier Permian Basin refining company.\"\nYemin concluded, \"It was a very active quarter, and we are better positioned for the future. We completed the purchase of the remaining units of Alon USA Partners we did not previously own, improved our financing structure and moved forward to divest non-core assets on the West Coast. We made further progress to capture synergies and have increased our annualized synergy target to a range of $115.0 million to $130.0 million. In addition, we completed the dropdown of our Big Spring logistics assets to DKL for $315.0 million. We ended the first quarter 2018 with approximately $1.0 billion of cash, while returning approximately $112.0 million of cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases during the period. I am pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 25 percent increase in our regular quarterly dividend, which follows the 33 percent increase approved in February 2018. We remain focused on creating long term value for our shareholders as our capital allocation program balances returning cash to our shareholders, investing in our business and exploring opportunities to provide future growth.\"\nIncluding the factors mentioned above, results on an adjusted basis improved year-over-year primarily due to the refining segment. The refining segment contribution margin was $133.6 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to a contribution margin of $64.4 million in the prior year period. The contribution from the Alon USA refineries acquired on July 1, 2017, the benefit from a 2017 biodiesel tax credit and RINs waiver, a higher crack spread environment and an increased Midland WTI to Brent crude oil price discount were factors in the year-over-year increase. The logistics segment contribution margin improved to $36.3 million during the quarter compared to $26.6 million in the prior year period as it benefited from the dropdown, improved wholesale margins in west Texas and better performance from the Paline Pipeline. The retail segment contribution margin was $11.9 million, which related to the retail business acquired on July 1, 2017 and does not have comparable prior year period results.\nSimplified Debt Structure\nOn March 30, 2018, Delek US closed on a new five year $1.0 billion senior secured revolving ABL credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a seven year $700.0 million senior secured term loan B (the “Term Loan”). Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25 to 1.75 percent based on excess availability. Approximately $300.0 million was borrowed on the Revolver at the closing of the transaction. The $700.0 million Term Loan carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.50 percent and was fully drawn at close. Proceeds from the Term Loan and borrowings under the Revolver were used to repay certain indebtedness of Delek and its subsidiaries, as well as costs in connection with the closing of the Term Loan and Revolver. The expected annual interest rate savings from this refinancing is approximately $20.0 million.\nFollowing the close of the Revolver and Term Loan, the remaining other borrowings outstanding include those certain Alon Successor Notes, the Reliant Bank Revolver and the Convertible Notes at Delek US, as well as the DKL Revolver and DKL Notes at Delek Logistics Partners, LP.\nSynergies Update\nSince the completion of the Alon USA transaction on July 1, 2017, through the first quarter 2018, Delek US captured approximately $104.0 million of annualized synergies. Delek US is now targeting total annualized synergies within a range of $115.0 million to $130.0 million, which is an increase from the previous guidance of $105.0 million to $120.0 million. On an annualized basis, these synergies are expected to be captured during 2018.\nAsset Divestitures\nDelek US has been exploring several potential initiatives relating to the California assets acquired in the Alon USA transaction on July 1, 2017, which it considers non-core to its geographic footprint. In March 2018, the Paramount, California assets, including the Alt Air renewable fuels plant, were sold and Delek US expects proceeds from this transaction to be approximately $72.0 million, including Delek US' portion of the biodiesel tax credit for 2017. In February 2018, Delek announced a definitive agreement to sell five asphalt terminals located on the West Coast for $75.0 million which is expected to close in the second quarter 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. Evaluation continues on the Long Beach, California location. The Long Beach and Paramount assets have been presented as discontinued operations since July 1, 2017.\nRegular Quarterly Dividend and Share Repurchase\nDelek US announced today that its Board of Directors had declared its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. Shareholders of record on May 21, 2018 will receive this cash dividend payable on June 4, 2018. This represents a 25 percent increase to the previous regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, Delek US repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for approximately $95.3 million, with an average price of $37.07 per share, under an existing $150.0 million share repurchase plan, leaving approximately $30.0 million of remaining authorization under this plan. The Board of Directors approved a new $150.0 million share repurchase authorization in February 2018, which has no expiration date. Including the remaining amount on previously approved authorization, Delek US has $179.7 million of total available authorization to repurchase shares at March 31, 2018.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Delek US had a cash balance of $1,018.0 million and total consolidated debt of $1,960.2 million, resulting in net debt of $942.2 million. As of March 31, 2018, Delek US' subsidiary, Delek Logistics, had $737.7 million of total debt and $4.8 million of cash, which is included in the consolidated amounts on Delek US' balance sheet. Excluding Delek Logistics, Delek US had approximately $1,013.2 million in cash and $1,222.5 million of debt, or a $209.3 million net debt position.\nRefining Segment\nRefining segment contribution margin was $133.6 million in the first quarter 2018 compared to $64.4 million in the first quarter 2017. On a year-over-year basis, results benefited from a higher crack spread environment, wider discount between Midland WTI crude oil and Brent crude oil and the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries acquired in the Alon USA transaction that closed on July 1, 2017. In addition, results in the first quarter 2018 included a benefit from a 2017 RINs waiver and 2017 biodiesel tax credit discussed below. The Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread increased to $11.53 per barrel for the first quarter 2018, compared to $10.58 per barrel for the same period in 2017. As discussed above, results in the first quarter 2018 were reduced by approximately $25.6 million of estimated lost profit opportunity.\nDuring the first quarter, the Midland WTI crude oil differential to Brent crude oil was an average discount of $4.70 per barrel compared to $2.81 per barrel in the prior year period. The Midland WTI crude oil differential to Cushing WTI was an average premium of $0.37 per barrel in first quarter 2018 compared to an average premium of $0.53 per barrel in the first quarter 2017. Backwardation in the oil futures market was $0.12 per barrel in the first quarter 2018, compared to contango of $1.00 per barrel in the first quarter 2017.\nIn March 2018, the El Dorado, Arkansas and Krotz Springs, Louisiana refineries received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency for a small refinery exemption from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the 2017 calendar year. This waiver resulted in approximately $59.3 million of RINs expense reduction at El Dorado and $31.6 million at Krotz Springs, based on an aggregated average price of $0.553 per RIN when it was received. In the first quarter 2017, El Dorado received a waiver for calendar 2016 that resulted in approximately $47.5 million of RINs expense reduction based on an aggregated average price of $0.451 per RIN when it was received.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, approximately $24.6 million of income was recognized in the renewables business in the refining segment from a $1 per gallon biodiesel blenders federal tax credit that was approved in February 2018 on a retroactive basis for calendar year 2017. For presentation purposes, approximately $15.4 million of this amount was allocated to the Tyler, Texas refinery and $6.0 million was allocated to El Dorado, Arkansas refinery.\nLogistics Segment\nThe logistics segment contribution margin in the first quarter 2018 increased to $36.3 million compared to $26.6 million in the first quarter 2017. The primary factors that increased contribution margin were a benefit from the drop down of the Big Spring refinery logistics assets that was effective March 1, 2018, a higher gross margin per barrel in west Texas and improved performance from the Paline Pipeline, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses on a year-over-year basis.\nRetail Segment\nAs a result of the Alon USA transaction on July 1, 2017, Delek US acquired approximately 300 stores operating primarily in west Texas and New Mexico. For the first quarter 2018, net sales for the retail segment were $209.6 million and contribution margin was $11.9 million. Merchandise sales were approximately $80.5 million with an average retail margin of 30.2% and approximately 53.7 million retail fuel gallons were sold at an average margin of $0.19 per gallon. Operating expenses for the retail segment were $24.5 million in the first quarter 2018.\nCorporate/Other Segment\nContribution margin from the Corporate/Other segment was $(29.5) million in the first quarter 2018 compared to $(5.7) million in the prior year period. This segment also includes the asphalt business acquired in the Alon USA transaction on July 1, 2017. The net hedging loss in the first quarter 2018 was $17.9 million compared to a net hedging loss of $3.5 million in the prior year period.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results | Conference Call Information\nDelek US will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time.
