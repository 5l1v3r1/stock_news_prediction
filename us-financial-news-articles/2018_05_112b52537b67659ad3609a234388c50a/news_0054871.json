Hungary sold almost 100 billion forints ($367.35 million)worth of papers, repeating the success of its previous three bi-weekly tenders despite fears that a sell-off in recent weeks may deter buyers. Hungarian bonds, after outperforming regional peers last year, have been worst hit in the region by the selling wave that has swept emerging markets this month due to a rally in the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields. But both the dollar and the 10-year U.S. yield retreated after Wednesday's Federal Reserve minutes did not suggest that it would accelerate its rate hikes. \"Turkey's (central bank) rate hike also improves sentiment. Not that it ends (lira) jitters, but they chose the way liked by investors,\" one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"This may start a rally in less risky emerging markets (like Central Europe).\" The average yields set at Hungary's bond auction were 30-40 basis points above levels two weeks ago, but below secondary market levels, and yield dropped further after the primary sale. The country's 10-year papers traded at a yield of 3.05 percent, down from 3.11 set at the auction and above 3.2 percent earlier this week, widening a gap with Poland's corresponding yield, which dropped 3 basis points to 3.19 percent. Yields in Poland rose much less in the past weeks than in Hungary. Hungary's 10-year yield closed a gap with its Polish peer earlier this week, after trading well below it for years. Poland also smoothly sold 3 billion zloty ($818.17 million ) worth of bonds offered at its own auction. \"For some investors these (yield) levels are attractive, especially because this situation (the recent sell-off) is not caused by Polish economic problems,\" said Mateusz Sutowicz, senior economist of Bank Millennium. Romania also sold a planned 200 million lei ($50.74 million)worth of bonds. The 2031-expiry series on offer are quite illiquid, but the 5.15 percent average yield, up 40 basis points from the previous sale of the bonds in February, made them attractive. Romanian bond yields reached 4-year highs recently, boosted by a surge in inflation and uncertainty over fiscal policy. The improved sentiment helped them retreat on Thursday, with the 10-year yield bid lower by 3 basis points at 4.88 percent, even though the leader of the ruling Social Democrats said late on Wednesday that the government would maintain its wage- and pension-boosting policies. The Czech Republic, meanwhile, where the central bank is seen increasing interest rates further later this year, sold 26-week Treasury bills at the highest yield in almost six years. Czech central bank governor Jiri Rusnok reiterated late on Wednesday that the bank might increase rates faster if the crown does not strengthen enough.
