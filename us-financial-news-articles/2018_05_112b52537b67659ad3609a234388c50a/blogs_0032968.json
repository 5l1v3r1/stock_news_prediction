From there, Cora will conjure the stock chart to appear on a wall in her virtual office like she’s showing off a financial graph on virtual projector.\nSchouela said one of the demonstration’s highlights is the ability for Cora to hear and respond to a person’s voice, which negates some of the need for people to fiddle with a VR controller to trigger certain commands.\nCurrently, the VR experiment is for Fidelity Labs only and is not intended for a wider release. That said, Schouela plans to show it to Fidelity customers to gauge their feedback.\nFor Amazon (amzn) , the VR experiment is a way the company is hoping to lure businesses to create VR apps using its tools and Amazon Web Services cloud computing features.\nAmazon Sumerian General Manager Kyle Roche said that by working with businesses like Fidelity Labs, it could create VR coding tools that cater to the specific needs of companies, rather than video game developers.\nOne difference Roche has noticed between gamers and enterprises that use Amazon’s VR tools, is that video game developers tend to “push for photorealistic characters” in their VR apps, whereas companies don’t necessarily care.\n“What we tried to do is make these characters approachable enough, and not too cartoony so they look like Tomb Raider ,” Roche said of the Fidelity Labs VR app.\nOne of the VR tidbits Schouela has learned trying out and building apps for headsets like the HTC Vive and Facebook’s Oculus Rift, is that some headsets are better suited for some tasks than others.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nFor instance, if a company wants to use VR as a training exercise for employees, it’s probably better to use VR headsets that are powered by smartphones—like the Samsung Gear VR or Google Daydream View . In situations where a company is training large groups of people using VR, having each person strap on a mobile VR headset is less expensive and cumbersome.\n“If you’re going to train a class of let’s say 50 people, you don’t want to set up like 50 HTC Vives,” Schouela said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T23:13:05.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
