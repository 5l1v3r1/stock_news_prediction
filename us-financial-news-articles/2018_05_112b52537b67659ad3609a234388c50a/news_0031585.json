A demo system is running and will be presented to various EMS stakeholders in the coming weeks. This application, already covered by STAR patents, is the “In-Flight System Aided Medical Monitoring” System (“STAR-ISAMM™”) and builds upon the demonstrated capabilities of existing STAR equipment. STAR-ISAMM™ is able to transmit, in real-time, the digital bio-information of a patient being transported by an air ambulance, saving critical time and allowing paramedics to tend to the patient without the need to verbally update the hospital. This application will see its deployment for air as well as ground medical transport. Star Navigation is presently working on the necessary regulatory approvals.\nAbout Star Navigation:\nStar Navigation Systems Group Ltd. owns the exclusive worldwide license to its proprietary, patented In-flight Safety Monitoring System, STAR-ISMS®, the heart of the STAR-A.D.S. ® System.
