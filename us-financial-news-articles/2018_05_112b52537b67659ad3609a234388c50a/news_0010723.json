REUTERS/Chris Keane “Some people have talked about a possible 12-hour interview. If it happens, that’s not going to happen, I’ll tell you that. It’d be, max, two to three hours around a narrow set of questions,” Giuliani, a former New York mayor who backed Trump in his presidential campaign said, according to the reporter’s Twitter post.\nSeparately, Giuliani told Bloomberg News that Trump’s legal team “would be inclined” to allow Special Counsel Robert Mueller to interview the president. “We would be inclined to do it,” Giuliani said, according to Bloomberg.\nHowever, he said if Mueller had already decided to believe former FBI Director James Comey’s account of events, “then we would just be leading him into the lion’s den,” Bloomberg reported. A year ago Trump fired Comey, who has since written a book critical of the president’s conduct.\nTrump has publicly wavered on whether he would sit down with Mueller’s investigators, who are looking into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.\nBoth Trump and Moscow deny any wrongdoing, and the president has called the investigation a political witch hunt.\nA spokeswoman for the White House did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, and a spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.\nMueller has charged 22 people and entities to date, including Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates.
