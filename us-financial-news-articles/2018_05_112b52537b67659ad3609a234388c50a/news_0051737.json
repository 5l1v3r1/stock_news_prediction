It is the most fundamental thing needed to ensure a healthy environment but we are taking too much of it,” said Boyd in a statement.\nThe agency said the huge public and industry demand for water was unsustainable and damaging rivers and local wildlife.\nSince 1900, an estimated 64-71 percent of the world’s natural wetland area has been lost due to human activity, according to the U.N.’s 2018 World Water Development Report.\nWater UK, which represents Britain’s big water and wastewater providers, said reducing leakages was a top priority.\n“The water industry works hard to protect the environment,” a spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We’ve also cut leakage a third since the 1990s, but we know there’s a lot more to do which is why it’s one of our top priorities.”\nWorldwide, 3.6 billion people, or nearly half the global population, live in areas at risk of being water-scarce for at least one month a year, the U.N. says.\nReporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian issues, conflicts, land and property rights, modern slavery and human trafficking, gender equality, climate change and resilience.
