REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo Covestro was spun off from Bayer in 2015 and Bayer said this latest sale marks the start of the full separation from its former unit.\nBayer, which is buying seed maker Monsanto ( MON.N ), raised 1.8 billion euros ($2.15 billion) in January from selling a 10.4 percent stake in Covestro.\nThe latest sale of around 29 million shares to institutional investors was set to generate proceeds of about 2.2 billion euros, Bayer said.\nBayer said that, after the sale, it would hold just under 7 percent of Covestro shares which it acquired from Bayer Pension Trust. These would be used to repay an exchangeable bond issued in 2017 that matures in 2020, Bayer said.\nBofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint bookrunners. They said the shares would be placed at a price range of 75.26 to market.\nCovestro shares closed at 76.48 euros on Thursday, while Bayer shares closed at 99.97 euros.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Edmund Blair\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
