He gave up two earned runs in 33 1/3 innings in April for an 0.54 ERA, the best in that month in franchise history among pitchers with at least 30 innings.\nThe White Sox had six hits, and Jose Abreu’s bloop double in the fourth inning was the only one for extra bases. The White Sox have lost four in a row and are 4-13 since April 12. They are 3-9 in one-run games,.\nYadier Molina had two of the Cardinals’ four hits. Fowler’s homer was his fourth.\nThe White Sox scored two runs in the seventh inning to make it 3-2. Tim Anderson singled and stole second before Dominic Leone replaced Martinez and walked Yoan Moncada with one out.\nYolmer Sanchez singled in Anderson and Abreu hit a sacrifice fly to score pinch runner Trayce Thompson. Moncada was forced to leave the game after sliding awkwardly into third base on Abreu’s fly.\nBud Norris struck out Nicky Delmonico to end the eighth inning and pitched the ninth for his sixth save.\nWhite Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito (1-4) gave up four hits and three runs, striking out seven and walking two. He had retired 12 straight before Martinez homered on the first pitch with two outs in the sixth.\nMolina’s infield single in the first inning was the Cardinals’ only hit until Martinez homered.\nMartinez gave up a single to Leury Garcia and walked Omar Navarez with one out in the seventh inning but induced rookie Daniel Palka to hit into his second double play of the game to end the inning.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:24:54.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
