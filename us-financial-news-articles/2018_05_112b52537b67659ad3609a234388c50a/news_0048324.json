Every time he has the ball at his feet he can do something magic.\n“He doesn’t score a lot of goals but he can create something with just one movement or pass. It’s simple, he’s a special player.”\nDe Bruyne’s passing and attacking play from deep is of the highest quality and he can find a player on the move with a perfectly placed and weighted pass.\nHe also has the ability to find the net from distance and is hard to catch with the ball at his feet and open space in front of him.\nIt helps Belgium coach Roberto Martinez to use De Bruyne in a central role in a 3-4-3 formation in the national side.\n“We get a lot of advantage from getting him on the ball,” the Spaniard said. “Systems very much depend on the teams you play but it is a system that has worked for us very well in qualification.”\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Neville Dalton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:09:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
