But the United States has fallen to number 11 in the ranking, falling out of the top five countries for the very first time.\nRussia, which has made a big play in recent years to improve relations with some Middle Eastern countries, now finds itself the fourth most popular country among young Arabs.\nThe survey is conducted using 3,500 face-to-face interviews with young Arabs between 18 and 24. An equal amount of men and women have been interviewed from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, North African countries, the Levant, and Palestinian territories.\nThe choice for Russia over the U.S. for young Arabs is particularly pronounced in the \"Levant + Other\" category which included respondents from Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestinian Territories, and Yemen.\nAcross that region, 31 percent chose Russia as their top ally while only 15 percent opted for the United States.\nThe survey concluded that there has been a \"dramatic shift\" in the last two years in Arab youth's perceptions of the U.S. Authors went as far as to say that a solid majority of young Arabs now consider the United States to be an adversary, rather than ally.\nJust under three-quarters of young Arabs view the election of Donald Trump, and his presidency, as a negative for the Middle East and North African region.\nThe rise of the so-called Islamic State, the global financial crisis, civil war in Syria and the rise of the Sunni-Shia divide are viewed even more negatively that the current White House administration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T12:58:14.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
