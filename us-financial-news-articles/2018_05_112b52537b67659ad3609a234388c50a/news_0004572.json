In a letter to the ZANU-PF national commissar seen by Reuters, Mutsvangwa rejected the result and said he would challenge it.\nDozens of ZANU-PF sitting MPs also lost, ushering in new faces who will face the opposition in July.\nMnangagwa, 75, in a statement said despite “teething” problems during the primaries, he was happy with the voter turnout. Official figures from many constituencies, however, showed turnout was lower.\n“We have sent clear signals to those who have chosen to pit themselves against the sheer might of our party,” he said.\nSome areas were yet to vote due to irregularities on the voter register while results were pending in others. Several losing candidates were contesting the results.\nMnangagwa’s main rival in the presidential vote — whose date is yet to be set — is 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa who took over leadership of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) following the death of its founding leader Morgan Tsvangirai in February.\nMnangagwa will launch ZANU-PF’s election manifesto on Friday. The MDC will hold its own primaries from Saturday.
