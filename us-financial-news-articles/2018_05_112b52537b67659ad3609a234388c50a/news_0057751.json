Audrey Gan (C), 31, poses for a portrait with her husband Leow Yee Shiang, 30, and their three-year-old son Kyler in Singapore, May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Feline Lim\nReuters photographers met people from Athens to Singapore trying to play their part as the war on plastics becomes a hot political topic and governments work to outlaw single-use items such as drinking straws and cotton buds.\nFor the photo essay: reut.rs/2H1PuSo\nEight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, the United Nations Environment Program said in December.\nThe impact hit home for Eri Sato, 32, when she lived in Canada and volunteered to clear up debris swept across the ocean from Japan, where she now lives in Yokohama, after the devastating earthquake and tsunami there in March 2011. One week's worth of plastic waste, used and collected by Audrey Gan's family, is displayed in Singapore, May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Feline Lim\n“It was the first time I realized how plastic waste pollutes the oceans and beaches all over the world. I think there’s no escaping the plastic waste,” she said.\nHow to cut down and eventually eradicate it is the question.\n“Since plastic is dominating our daily life, it would be very difficult to stop using it. But, if someone somehow makes it like a habit, we think we could stop buying altogether,” said Alexandra Patrikiou, 39, in the Greek capital Athens, who works hard to recycle paper and glass and buy recycled products.\nHer comments were echoed by Brandy Wilbur in Wenham, Massachusetts.

They don’t understand it. Also not using plastic bags for vegetables is considered disgusting, they hate it .. but I still do it,” said Tatiana Schnittke, 39, in Jaffa, Israel.
