For the full-year, it reiterated its revenue and margin guidance.\n“The Micro Focus team is making encouraging progress on improving both the discipline and speed of execution within the business,” new Chief Executive Stephen Murdoch said.\nShares in Micro Focus fell 46 percent on the day of its profit warning in March. The shares are up 25 percent since that day.\nReporting by Kate Holton; editing by Sarah Young\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:37:11.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
