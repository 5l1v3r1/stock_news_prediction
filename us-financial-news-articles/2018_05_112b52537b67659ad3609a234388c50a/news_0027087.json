Critics blame strict price and currency controls for the mess.\nMaduro threatened stronger measures, while government officials visited pharmacies and supermarkets in Caracas to sanction vendors for selling at high prices.\nLast week, the government took over the country’s largest private bank and arrested 11 top executives, as part of an operation that seeks to curb black market foreign exchange trades.\nThe primary opposition parties are boycotting the election, calling it a sham.\nU.S. Vice President echoed their words earlier this week and called on the Organization of American States to suspend Venezuela’s membership.
