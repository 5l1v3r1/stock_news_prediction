Police estimated up to 10,000 people, waving flags and carrying banners, took part.\nIn central Cebu, Duterte asked Congress to pass a law amending the “outdated” Labour Code “to keep it attuned to the realities of our time”.\n“I remain firm in my commitment to put an end to ‘ENDO’ and illegal contractualisation,” Duterte said, referring to commonly used term of “end of contract” among minimum wage earners.\n“A mere executive order is not enough. I cannot be a legislator. It is not allowed. But, I can only implement.”\nHe signed an executive order prohibiting illegal contracting or sub-contracting and asked the labour department to submit a list of companies “engaged in or suspected to be engaged in labour-only contraction.\nThere were also protests in other key cities outside the capital as workers’ groups demanded higher wages, improved working conditions, including for millions of migrant workers abroad. The Philippines is locked in a dispute with Kuwait over reports of abuse of Philippine domestic helpers there.\nLast month, the labour department ordered fast-food chain Jollibee Foods Corp to regularise more than 6,000 workers by making them permanent.
