(OTCQX:OMCM), a global leading provider of clinical data management technology, today announced record financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are off to a considerably better start this year in comparison to last year,” said Stephen Johnson, chief executive officer and president of OmniComm. “With more than 120 clients and the introduction of three new product lines — IRTMaster, Acuity and AutoEncoder — we are well-positioned for strong financial growth in the near future. These new product lines, coupled with a shift in our business toward a subscription model, will enhance the predictability and sustainability of future revenue.”\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, OmniComm reported revenue of $7.2 million, a 25% increase over the prior year’s first quarter revenue of $5.7 million. Gross margin improved by 35% to $6.0 million. Operating expenses increased by 15% or $0.6 million to $5.1 million, which resulted in operating income of $0.9 million. EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure OmniComm uses as an additional financial measure, was $1.0 million compared to $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOmniComm provides EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as additional information to its financial results. Non-GAAP EBITDA excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses that are included in operating income. Non-GAAP EBITDA is not an alternative or substitute for the financial measure prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) of operating income. The non-GAAP EBITDA financial measure presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define this non-GAAP financial measure in the same way. OmniComm’s management uses non-GAAP EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency and as a goal for incentive compensation. Management believes non-GAAP EBITDA is a useful measure investors may use as an additional factor in their analysis of OmniComm’s performance. Please review the below reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure operating income, as well as OmniComm’s financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOMNICOMM SYSTEMS, INC.
