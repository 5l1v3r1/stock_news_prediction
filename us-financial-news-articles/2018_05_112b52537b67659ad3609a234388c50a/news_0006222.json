Only two REITs tracked by Moody’s— CBL & Associates CBL 1.67% and Washington Prime—face an exposure of over 10%, a level the ratings company deems to be “significant.”\nWhat’s more, most of the retail REITs continue to maintain high occupancy rates and rent space for average rents that are above the rents in expiring leases, Moody’s said.\n“Failing retailers have limited impact on rated retail REITs’ operating performance, with the effects concentrated in weak malls,” the report said.\nRetail property has been the pariah of the real-estate industry in recent years as online competition has siphoned away business. Mall and shopping center landlords have suffered overall as many of the biggest retailers have failed or contracted.\nBut the Moody’s report illustrates that some landlords are being hurt more than others. The average occupancy rate for the retail REITs rated by the firm exceeded 96% at the end of 2017, the report said.\n“We’re not saying we’re bullish on retail. By no means,” said Philip Kibel, a Moody’s associate managing director. “We’re saying from a credit perspective, we’re not as concerned with these [REITs].”\nThat is largely because many of their properties are in strong locations that still enjoy high demand from retailers. Through smart management, landlords can use their top properties to fuel leasing at more vulnerable properties, the report points out.\n“REITs can help their weaker tenants by strategically relocating stores to shopping centers with greater traffic,” the report said. This tactic gives REITs the ability “to negotiate with tenants to keep stores open in less robust locations and reduce vacancies.”\nAlso some expanding retailers are making up for those that are struggling traditional big box and anchor stores. Replacement tenants include movie theaters and other “experience-oriented” tenants and off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Ross Dress for Less, Moody’s said.\nOf course, not all is cheery even among the stronger retail REITs. For one thing, stock investors have tended to paint the entire sector with a broad brush.\nAs of Tuesday, mall and strip center REITs were trading at 21.6% and 21.5% discounts to the value of their assets, according to Green Street Advisors. The overall REIT market was at a 8.5% discount, the firm said.\nAt the same time, some of the rental growth among the Moody’s rated malls has slowed. In 2017, the so-called “leasing spread”—the difference between the average rent in new leases versus expiring leases—was 9.6%. That was down from the 11.1% those REITs chalked up in 2016.\nMoody’s downgraded its credit rating of CBL in February and changed its rating outlook of Washington Prime to negative from stable in June 2017. “There’s a big difference between them and Simon [Properties],” Mr. Kibel said.\nBut Moody’s pointed out that many REITs have shored up their balance sheets by reducing leverage. That, coupled with positive cash flow, “will provide the REITs with financial flexibility to develop and redevelop their portfolios to attract tenants,” the report said.\nWrite to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T06:39:26.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
