Investors also fear a clean-up process demanded by regulators may slow down, with foreign investors demanding a bigger discount to buy soured bank debts due to political instability.\nItaly’s banking index .FTIT8300 closed down 3.7 percent at a near one-year low.\nBanco BPM was the worst hit after a downgrade to “neutral” by Goldman Sachs analysts, who said bad loan disposals remained key for the bank but foreign demand for distressed assets in Italy was now more uncertain.\nBanco BPM, which was born early last year from the merger of Banco Popolare and Popolare di Milano, had already come under pressure recently after disappointing investors with first-quarter earnings.
