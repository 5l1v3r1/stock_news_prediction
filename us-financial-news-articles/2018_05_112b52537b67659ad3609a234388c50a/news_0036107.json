Two-year Italian government yields are now back in positive territory for the first time in almost a year – the only other positive yielding two-year euro zone government bond is Greece.\n“I’m still sceptical on the euro, there is a lot of headline risk,” Saxo bank’s Hardy said, adding the worry for lira was that investors will bolt even before they know Erdogan’s post- election plans.\nBACK TO THE FUTURES The other major mover was oil which was up at $80 a barrel for first time since late 2014.\nWith the global economy running at a healthy clip demand remains strong, while U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to re-impose sanctions on Iran could potentially cut global supply by a million barrels a day.\nBrent crude futures were last at $80.01 per barrel, up 0.9 percent from their last close with U.S. WTI crude up almost 70 cents at $72.19. Both are now up almost 30 percent since February and 80 percent since June last year.\n“The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay,” said Norbert Rücker, head of macro and commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “Supply concerns are front of mind after the United States left the Iran nuclear deal.”\nU.S. bank Morgan Stanley meanwhile raised its Brent price forecast to $90 per barrel by 2020 due to a steady increase in demand.\nBack in the currency markets, sterling nudged up against both the dollar and the euro after a UK newspaper reported that Prime Minister Theresa May would tell Brussels that Britain was prepared to stay in the European Union’s customs union after a transitional arrangement beyond 2021.\nPressure on Mexico’s peso returned though as hopes for a new-look NAFTA trade deal with the U.S. and Canada were pushed back and as the country’s central bank said its systems had been hit by a 300 million pesos ($15.33 million) cyber attack.\nThe United States and China also launch trade talks later on Thursday in a bid to avert a damaging tariff war.\nThe White House’s harshest China critic Peter Navarro, the administration’s trade and manufacturing adviser, has been relegated to a supporting role, senior Trump administration officials have said. It has followed reports of clashes with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\nAdditional reporting by Ron Bousso in London; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:26:44.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
