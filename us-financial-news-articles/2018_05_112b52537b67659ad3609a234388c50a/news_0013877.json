Berrios retired the side in order in the sixth.\nIn the seventh, Twins lefty reliever Zach Duke got the first two outs before giving up a single to Yolmer Sanchez, his third hit of the game.\nDuke gave way to right-hander Ryan Pressly, who allowed an infield hit and a walk to load the bases, again bringing Davidson up with the bags full. But Davidson, who has nine homers this season, struck out on a check swing.\nThe Twins’ bullpen combined for three shutout innings, concluding with Fernando Rodney’s fourth save in seven opportunities.\nWhite Sox starter Carson Fulmer, who was coming off his best start of the season after throwing seven shutout innings in a win in Kansas City on April 28, didn’t make it out of the fourth, giving up five runs (four earned) on seven hits and two walks.\nThe White Sox jumped out to a 2-0 lead on a two-run home run from Abreu, his seventh, in the first inning.\nHowever, Escobar hit his first homer of the game, his fifth of the season, to lead off the second against Fulmer. Ryan LaMarre singled in a run later in the inning.\nIn the third, Dozier led off with a bomb to left-center field, and two outs later, Escobar homered to right. Logan Morrison, who homered in Thursday night’s loss to the White Sox, went back-to-back on a long home run to center field.\nIn the third, Sanchez tripled to right field and scored when Abreu, who had three hits on the night, grounded out.\nGarcia, who had two hits, slugged his first home run of the season in the fourth.\nYoan Moncada, who missed Thursday’s game with a sore left hamstring, left Friday’s game in the bottom of the fifth inning after retreating gingerly to first base on a flyout. Adam Engel pinch ran.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T16:23:37.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
