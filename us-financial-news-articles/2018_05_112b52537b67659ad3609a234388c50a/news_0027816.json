Higher sales of forged engineered products to the oil and gas industry was the primary driver, while sales of forged and cast rolls also increased.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $0.9 million, or $0.08 earnings per common share, compared to net loss of $4.8 million, or $0.39 loss per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nLoss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $1.1 million, compared to loss from operations of $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as the impact of higher overall shipment volumes and pricing more than offset the effect of higher raw material and operating costs and lower cost absorption related to a partial plant idling.\nOther income (expense) – net for the three months ended March 31, 2018, improved by $4.1 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, including a one-time current period benefit of $2.4 million related to a contractual settlement with a third party, higher pension income of $1.1 million, and the non-recurring prior year cost of $0.4 million related to extinguishing the outstanding debt of ASW Steel, Inc., acquired in November 2016.\nSales for the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased approximately 15% compared to prior year. Despite the loss of a key customer to a plant closure, higher shipment volumes of forged engineered products to the oil and gas industry led the increase. Sales of forged and cast mill rolls also increased. The segment recorded an operating income, compared to an operating loss in the prior year, due to the higher shipment volumes and improved pricing, partly mitigated by higher raw material and operating costs and unfavorable cost absorption related to the idling of a cast roll foundry which was in full operation in the prior year period.\nSales for the Air and Liquid Processing segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018, declined approximately 3%, as lower sales of centrifugal pumps to U.S. Navy shipbuilders was partly offset by higher sales demand for custom air handlers. Segment operating income declined for the quarter compared to prior year, in line with the lower sales volumes.\nRemarking on the quarter’s results, John Stanik, Ampco-Pittsburgh’s Chief Executive Officer said, “Although pleased with our continued improvement, we remain focused on further operational advances, equipment reliability and commercial terms to be able to sustain and expand on this progress as our order book grows.”\nTeleconference Access\nAmpco-Pittsburgh Corporation (NYSE: AP) will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nWe encourage participants to pre-register for the conference call at http://dpregister.com/10119580 .
