REUTERS/Terray Sylvester/File Photo They mainly came to see the Kalapana flow, a stream of lava that flows from one of Kalauea’s craters and cuts through an abandoned town of the same name on its way to the sea.\nKerry Kelly, 70, a longtime resident of Pahoa, said the area saw a “huge” uptick in revenue as a result of the “Kalapana flow”. It began in 1991, pouring into the streets, igniting homes, and burying everything in a layer of thick volcanic rock.\nThe lava flow became a major tourist draw, pulling hundreds of visitors a day. Residents began running tours by boat, bicycle and off-road vehicles. Vendors set up food stands.\nThen it stopped a few months ago, Kelly said. The latest series of eruptions, quakes and clouds of toxic sulphur that has forced hundreds of people to evacuate has made things worse.\n“Business was already dropping, and then to have this happen ... This is not just a physical disaster,” said Kelly. “We’re bordering on an economic disaster.”\nBusiness has all but petered out, said Arianna Arakaki, 21, who manages Pele’s Kitchen, a popular restaurant.\n“As soon as the lava started going off, business dropped off because everyone started saving money,” said Arakaki, a native Hawaiian who worships Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess.\nLava tourism was essential to Pele’s Kitchen, such as a flow that approached the town in 2014. Tour boat operators would bring visitors to the restaurant for breakfast after sunrise viewing trips, she said.\nSteam rises from a new fissure in Puna, Hawaii, U.S. in this still image from video taken on May 8, 2018.

When people you know are losing their homes, it’s different,” Arakaki said.\nThe semi-rural wooded area had also become a magnet for newcomers looking to settle on the Big Island of Hawaii, home to about 200,000 people, who were prepared to risk living near an active volcano for more affordable real estate.\nHawaii’s 4,028-sq.-mile (10,432-sq.-km) Big Island accounts for less than a fifth of the state’s tourism. State data show that in the first three months of 2018, it pulled in 16 percent of the $4.8 billion visitors spent in Hawaii, less than half of levels in Oahu and Maui.\nAmedeo Markoff, 49, runs an art gallery and a group promoting Pahoa tourism and business. “What a time to be that guy,” he said.\nFor now the eruption was “a business disaster,” said Markoff, although he has seen a few disaster tourists straggle into town.\nBut he is cautiously optimistic the eruption will draw more tourist dollars to the area, just as the Kalapana flow did after devastating that town.\n“Our town is at the epicenter of an amazing, phenomenal spectacle,” he said. “It does put us in focus.”\nBut he added, “Any benefits to the community are far outweighed by the trauma to the community.”\nReporting by Terray Sylvester; Writing by Bill Tarrant; Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T13:28:48.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
