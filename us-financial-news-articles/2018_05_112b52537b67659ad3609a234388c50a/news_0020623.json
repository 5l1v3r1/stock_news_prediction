The stock is down nearly 22 percent year-to-date, dragged down by the extended slump in United Arab Emirates real estate markets.\nConstruction firm Arabtec, which had hit a nine-year low on Wednesday, jumped 8.8 percent after reporting a first-quarter net profit attributable to shareholders of 63.6 mln dirhams ($17.3 million), up from 17.6 million dirhams a year ago and its highest profit since the third quarter of 2014.\nAbu Dhabi’s index dropped 1.1 percent as Abu Dhabi National Energy Co slipped 2.3 percent despite posting a 43 percent rise in first-quarter profit, boosted by higher crude oil prices.\nIn Egypt, the index sank 1.8 percent as Commercial International Bank, the biggest bank, dropped 3.3 percent. It reported a 17 percent rise in first-quarter consolidated net profit after minority interests, but that was slightly lower than its 21 percent profit rise in the fourth quarter and 23 percent in the third quarter. SAUDI ARABIA\n* The index rose 0.5 percent to 7,914 points. DUBAI\n* The index fell 0.3 percent to 2,882 points. ABU DHABI\n* The index dropped 1.1 percent to 4,438 points. QATAR\n* The index slipped 0.9 percent to 8,750 points. KUWAIT\n* The index rose 0.2 percent to 4,797 points. BAHRAIN\n* The index edged down 0.02 percent to 1,271 points.
