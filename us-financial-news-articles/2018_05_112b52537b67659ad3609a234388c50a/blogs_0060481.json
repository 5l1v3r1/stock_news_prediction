That's up nearly 2.6 percent from a year ago. But the pace of annual wage growth slowed from its peak of 2.96 percent in June 2017.\nMucci thinks the pace of wage growth will be back to those high levels by the end of the summer if businesses spend less on investments, benefits and automation.\n\"While optimism is up for small businesses, they do feel right now that their biggest issue is recruiting, hiring and retaining those hard-to-find workers,\" Mucci said.\nEven though the West showed the highest wage growth in May, Mucci said difficulty in finding workers is felt the most in that region.\nAccording to the survey, Texas had the highest state job growth in May while Arizona remained first in annual hourly earnings growth.\nPaychex — a provider of payroll, human resource, insurance and benefits outsourcing services for small-to-medium-sized businesses — draws its numbers from client payroll data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:13:31.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
