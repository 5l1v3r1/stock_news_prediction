Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with its stock plans and for other corporate purposes.\nThe repurchase program will be funded using the company’s working capital. As of December 31, 2017, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $365 million.\nAcacia Communications had 40,052,395 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 21, 2018.\nAbout Acacia Communications\nAcacia Communications develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that are designed to transform communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost.
