He added however that given the current country ratings, the perceived risk remains higher than in other Middle East markets.\nOther deals include a club loan of around $600 million for National Bank of Egypt, sources told Reuters earlier this week. .\nIn the market, there is also a $450 million refinancing loan for Egyptian Fertilizers Company, a subsidiary of Netherlands-listed OCI N.V.., a company led by Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris, sources said.\nEEHC, which did not respond to a request for comment on its new fundraising exercise, has borrowed extensively in the past.\nIn 2015 it raised a $521 million loan provided by a group of Egyptian banks and National Bank of Abu Dhabi – now First Abu Dhabi Bank.\nThe following year, the Egyptian utility borrowed 3.5 billion euros through a debt facility backed by export credit agencies for the construction of three gas-fired power plants. For those projects, worth 6 billion euros, it also raised a $1.2 billion loan with local banks.
