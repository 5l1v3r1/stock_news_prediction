The Bouygues Telecom company logo is seen on a shop in Paris, France, May 17, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nThe relatively strong performance at Bouygues Telecom\nenabled the conglomerate to maintain its prediction of a further rise in full year profit, in spite of the weak first quarter.\nA bitterly cold winter in Europe impacted Bouygues’ road construction arm Colas, yet Bouygues said the quarter was not representative of how the company was expected to perform over the full year.\nBouygues Telecom again improved its results, reflecting growth in its mobile and fixed-line customer base. Bouygues, which failed to merge its telecoms unit with market leader Orange ( ORAN.PA ) two years ago, said it should gradually improve profits over the course of 2018.\nAsked about second quarter trends, deputy chief executive Philippe Marien said the climate would remain supportive for construction — thanks partly to plans to expand the Paris area’s infrastructure — and be “very competitive” in telecoms.

REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier/File Photo\nFirst-quarter revenues at the family-controlled group, which also owns France’s biggest private TV broadcaster TF1 ( TFFP.PA ), dipped 0.2 percent to 6.826 billion euros (6 billion pounds).\nIts current operating loss also widened to 111 million euros from a 75 million loss last year, reflecting a 302 million loss at Colas, with the results coming in below market forecasts. SHARES SLIP LOWER\nBouygues' shares were down 1.2 percent in mid-session trading, among the worst performers on the Paris market .FCHI .\n“Telecom ahead, property and Colas light,” said Barclays analysts, who have an “Equal Weight” rating on the stock.\nBouygues Telecom’s quarterly revenues rose 6 percent to 1.281 billion euros, with the unit’s current operating profit also surging 56 percent to 50 million euros.\nBouygues Telecom, which added 453,000 mobile customers in the first quarter, also confirmed its targets for 2018 and 2019.\nFrance’s telecoms sector, hit by a price war following the entrance of low-cost player Iliad ( ILD.PA ) in 2012, has been the subject of takeover speculation in recent years.\nLast month, Bouygues said it was not in discussions with any other operator, denying a report it was weighing a bid for the French SFR telecoms unit of rival Altice ( ATCA.AS ).\nBouygues Telecom has said it can prosper on its own and has responded with a turnaround plan including job cuts and a focus on the rollout of its 4G network and fixed-line broadband.\nBouygues Telecom’s robust performance came amid heavy promotions by Altice’s SFR and market leader Orange ( ORAN.PA ), which rival Iliad had partly blamed for its own weaker-than-expected results earlier this week.\nBouygues, which sees its debts standing at around 4 billion euros by end-2018, has nevertheless carried out some takeover deals of late, including its purchase of the engineering services business of utility Alpiq ( ALPH.S ).
