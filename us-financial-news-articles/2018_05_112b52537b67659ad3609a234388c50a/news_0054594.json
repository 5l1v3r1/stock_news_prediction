Import duties on certain cosmetics were halved to 5 percent.\nIn March this year, Premier Li Keqiang said in his annual work report that China will expand imports and lower import duties on automobiles and some everyday consumer goods as part of China’s opening up.\nEarlier this week, Beijing said it would cut import tariffs on the majority of autos to 15 percent from 25 percent, effective from July 1. Duties on auto parts would be cut to 6 percent from mostly around 10 percent.\nThe planned tariff cuts on consumer goods will affect food, medicine, health products and cosmetics, among other items, Bloomberg cited one of its sources as saying.\nThe cuts also would be in line with Beijing’s goal of boosting consumption within its borders to support growth as the world’s second-biggest economy slows.\nRetail sales growth slowed to 9.4 percent last month, missing forecasts for a 10.0 percent gain and off March’s pace of 10.1 percent.\nReporting by Ryan Woo and Stella Qiu; Editing by Kim Coghill & Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T12:09:27.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
