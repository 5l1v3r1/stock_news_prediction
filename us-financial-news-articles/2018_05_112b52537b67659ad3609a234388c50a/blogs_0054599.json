The issue has drawn much attention after a spate of cases of flesh-eating bacterial diseases in parts of northern Thailand that some researchers believe may be linked to exposure to paraquat.\nCritics also question the safety of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the widely used weedkiller Roundup, though its manufacturer Monsanto insists the chemical is safe.\nSomboon said 18 of the 24-people on the committee supported continued use of the chemicals.\n\"The committee considered all the information, including impacts on health and the environment, from both sides, those who support the ban and those are against, and we decided that we don't have enough data to ban the usage of these chemicals,\" he said.\nParaquat is the main ingredient in Swiss-based Syngenta AG's Gramoxone — one of the world's three most widely used weedkillers — but it also is sold under other brand names. Most paraquat is made in China, where authorities plan to ban use of the chemical as of September 2020.\nUse of paraquat has risen sharply in Thailand, partly due to growing resistance to glyphosate.\nThe government experts found that more than half the farmers they surveyed had used paraquat incorrectly, such as in higher concentrations than recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:18:50.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
