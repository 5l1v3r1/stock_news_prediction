We are also advancing our topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor programs, with results from multiple Phase 2 trials expected this year. As our early-stage pipeline compounds advance towards the clinic, we continue to progress towards our goal of becoming a vertically integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a robust clinical-stage pipeline and drug discovery engine,” said Dr. Neal Walker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aclaris.\nClinical Pipeline Update:\nA-101 45% Topical Solution\nIn March 2018, announced positive results from the 3-month, post-treatment, follow-up evaluation period of the twice-weekly placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial (WART-203) of A-101 45% Topical Solution (A-101 45%), an investigational new drug consisting of a proprietary high-concentration stabilized hydrogen peroxide topical solution being developed as a prescription treatment for common warts (verruca vulgaris).\nOver the 3-month post-treatment follow-up period, clinically and statistically significant greater improvements in common wart reduction and clearance vs. placebo were observed among subjects treated with A-101 45%.\nScheduled an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for mid-2018, and plan to initiate two pivotal Phase 3 trials in the second half of 2018.\nJAK Inhibitor Candidates\nAA-202 Topical – an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ATI-502 for the topical treatment of alopecia areata (AA). This trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of ATI-502 compared with placebo in 12 patients with AA. This randomized, double-blind clinical trial is being conducted at two investigational centers within the United States, and topline data are expected in the first half of 2018.

This trial is being conducted at two investigational centers in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, and topline qualitative data are expected mid-2018.\nAA-201 Topical – an ongoing Phase 2 dose ranging trial of ATI-502 for the topical treatment of AA. This trial will evaluate the effect of two concentrations of ATI-502 on the regrowth of hair in a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trial in up to 120 patients with AA. This trial is being conducted in the United States and data are expected by year end 2018.\nVITI-201 Topical – an ongoing Phase 2 open-label clinical trial of ATI-502 for the topical treatment of vitiligo.

This trial will evaluate the effect of two concentrations of ATI-501 on the regrowth of hair in a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trial in 120 to 160 patients with AA. This trial will be conducted in the United States and data are expected in mid-2019.\nATI-450 (MK-2 Inhibitor)\nInvestigational New Drug application on track for submission to the FDA in mid-2019.\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nExclusively licensed the Canadian rights to commercialize A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of raised seborrheic keratoses to Cipher Pharmaceuticals.\nAppointed Bryan Reasons as a director and Chairman of the Audit Committee.\nFinancial Highlights\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, Aclaris had aggregate cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $187.0 million compared to $208.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The $21.9 million decrease during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included:\nNet loss of $30.2 million, offset by $5.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, $2.1 million of net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities, and $0.9 million for a non-cash expense associated with an increase in the fair value of a contingent consideration liability.\n$0.3 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment.\n$0.4 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.\nAclaris anticipates that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund its operations into the second half of 2019, without giving effect to any potential new business development transactions or financing activities.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet loss was $30.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenue of $1.1 million and cost of revenue of $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 related to Aclaris’s contract research business acquired in August 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $31.1 million, compared to $12.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $13.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase of $5.8 million was primarily attributable to a $2.7 million increase in expenses related to the preclinical and clinical development of Aclaris’s JAK inhibitor portfolio, a $1.3 million increase in medical affairs activities and early-stage drug discovery, a $0.9 million increase in fair value of the contingent consideration liability, a $0.8 million increase in Aclaris’s A-101 45% topical solution program as Phase 2 clinical trials were initiated in June 2017, and a $0.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to increased headcount. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in ESKATA development expenses in the first quarter of 2018.\nSales and marketing expenses were $11.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The $9.8 million increase is mainly due to increases in direct marketing and professional fees, as well as other sales and marketing expenses of $5.8 million, in preparation for the commercial launch of ESKATA in the second quarter of 2018. Personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation, increased by $4.0 million as Aclaris completed the hiring of its field sales force in the first quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase of $2.6 million was primarily attributable to $1.6 million in higher personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to increased headcount, a $0.4 million increase in professional and legal fees, and a $0.5 million increase in facility, support and other general and administrative expenses.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nAclaris reiterated its expected 2018 GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses to be in the range of $67 to $75 million, including estimated stock-based compensation of $9 million. The anticipated increase in R&D expenses in 2018 is mainly due to the planned execution of Phase 2 clinical trials in AA, AGA, and vitiligo, two planned pivotal Phase 3 trials in common warts, and the development of our early stage pipeline compounds.\nAclaris reiterated its expected 2018 GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to be in the range of $80 to $86 million, including estimated stock-based compensation of $14 million. The anticipated increase in SG&A expenses in 2018 is primarily the result of the deployment of Aclaris’s new sales force in January 2018 and the additional selling, marketing and consumer initiatives to support the commercial launch of ESKATA.\nCompany to Host Conference Call\nManagement will conduct a conference call at 5:00 P.M.
