We are working on how to exactly address those issues,” Dombrovskis said.\nHe also told parliament it was important to have a “credible and coordinated” anti-money laundering system at the EU level without waiting for action from the United States, Dombrovskis added.\nEarlier this year, the United States accused Latvia’s third biggest bank, ABLV, of money laundering and breaking sanctions on North Korea, prompting its closure and triggering the Baltic state’s worst financial crisis in a decade.\nIt raised questions about Europe’s ability to monitor money laundering on its own turf.
