So far this year, the stock has fallen about 5 percent. However, over the past 12 months, it has soared more than 50 percent. Caterpillar, as of Monday's close, had a market value of nearly $90 billion.\nCaterpillar did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
