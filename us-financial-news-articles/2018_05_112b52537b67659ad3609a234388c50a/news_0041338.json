Price assessments last week were still looking at cargoes loading in June.\nThe LNG market is in the midst of the northern hemisphere’s low-demand spring season, during which little gas is typically used. Demand this year has been relatively strong, however, pushing spot prices higher than the seasonal average.\nStronger prices for other power generating fuels coal and oil are also lending support to LNG prices. Oil prices climbed to above $80 per barrel this week, the first time since late 2014.\nGlobal gas inventory levels heading into the summer are below the seasonal average as well, also boosting prices, Goldman Sachs analysts said earlier this week.\nGas inventories across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development may be 650 billion cubic feet (bcf) below the seasonal average, equivalent to a shortfall of 4.3 days of demand, the Goldman analysts said.\nMaintenance in Angola’s Soyo plant in July and delays on Australia’s massive new Ichthys LNG project are also expected to tighten supplies. TENDERS AND TRADES\nMeanwhile, Chinese buyers, including state-owned companies, are back in the spot market looking for cargoes for the next few months, trade sources said.\nGas distributor ENN, for instance, is seeking a commissioning cargo for China’s first privately owned LNG import terminal, expected to be ready in two months.\nPakistan LNG is also seeking six LNG cargoes of about 140,000 cubic metres each for delivery over July to August, as three new power plants in the country start up after initial teething issues.\nSouth Korea’s POSCO and Korea Midland Power Co Ltd (Komipo) are both seeking spot cargoes for delivery in July as well.\nKorea Gas Corp may look for cargoes ahead of winter to build up inventories and to meet summer demand, though the requirement will depend on the status of nuclear plants in the country, a source familiar with the matter said.\nIndian Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd are also looking for cargoes for delivery in June.\nOn the supply side, Indonesia’s Donggi-Senoro LNG export plant has offered a cargo for late-June loading, traders said.
