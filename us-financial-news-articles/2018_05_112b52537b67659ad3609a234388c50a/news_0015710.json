(Nasdaq: CRZO) today announced the Company’s financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and provided an operational update, which includes the following highlights:\nTotal production of 51,257 Boe/d, 11% above the first quarter of 2017 and above the high-end of the Company’s guidance range Crude oil production of 34,136 Bbls/d, 18% above the first quarter of 2017 Net income attributable to common shareholders of $14.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, and Net cash provided by operating activities of $138.7 million Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of $39.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA of $136.4 million Initial Eagle Ford Shale multipad came online on schedule and has recently been producing at gross rates of more than 12,000 Bbls/d Another strong Delaware Basin Wolfcamp B well that achieved oil production rates of more than 1,000 Bbls/d\nCarrizo reported first quarter of 2018 net income attributable to common shareholders of $14.7 million, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $40.0 million, or $0.61 per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The net income attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017 include certain items typically excluded from published estimates by the investment community. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, which excludes the impact of these items as described in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included below, for the first quarter of 2018 was $39.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $12.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $136.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation to net income attributable to common shareholders are presented in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included below.\nProduction volumes during the first quarter of 2018 were 4,613 MBoe, or 51,257 Boe/d, an increase of 11% versus the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year comparison is impacted by a significant amount of acquisition and divestiture (A&D) activity, including the acquisition of properties in the Delaware Basin, and the divestiture of the Company’s Appalachia, DJ Basin, and downdip Eagle Ford Shale assets. Pro forma for this A&D activity, the Company’s production increased by more than 40% versus the first quarter of 2017, driven by development in the Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin. Crude oil production during the first quarter of 2018 averaged 34,136 Bbls/d, an increase of 18% versus the first quarter of 2017; natural gas and NGL production were 53,446 Mcf/d and 8,213 Bbls/d, respectively, during the first quarter of 2018. First quarter of 2018 production exceeded the high end of the Company’s guidance range of 48,600-49,800 Boe/d; this was partially due to an earlier-than-anticipated expansion of the Company’s water-handling capacity in the Delaware Basin.\nDrilling, completion, and infrastructure capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $209.9 million. Approximately 65% of the first quarter drilling, completion, and infrastructure spending was in the Eagle Ford Shale, while approximately 35% was in the Delaware Basin. Land and seismic expenditures during the quarter were $5.5 million, and were primarily focused in the Delaware Basin.\nFor 2018, Carrizo is maintaining its drilling, completion, and infrastructure capital expenditure guidance of $750-$800 million. The Company’s 2018 development plan continues to call for it to run an average of 5-6 rigs and 2-3 completion crews during the year between its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin. Based on this level of activity, Carrizo expects to drill 93-103 gross (82-91 net) operated wells and complete 113-123 gross (96-105 net) operated wells during the year.\nCarrizo is reiterating its 2018 production guidance of 58,500-60,100 Boe/d. Crude oil is expected to account for 65%-67% of the Company’s production for the year, while total liquids are expected to account for 80%-84%. This equates to annual production growth of approximately 10% using the midpoint of the range. Pro forma for the Company’s A&D activity, 2018 guidance equates to year-over-year production growth of more than 30%, with crude oil production growth of more than 20%. For the second quarter of the year, Carrizo expects production to be 53,800-54,800 Boe/d; crude oil is expected to account for 67% of production, while total liquids are expected to account for 82%. A full summary of Carrizo’s guidance is provided in the attached tables.\nS.P. “Chip” Johnson, IV, Carrizo’s President and CEO, commented on the results, “The first quarter was an excellent start to the year for the Company as we accomplished every milestone we had identified for the period. We wrapped up our previously-announced divestiture program with both the DJ Basin and downdip Eagle Ford divestitures closing on schedule, and we used the proceeds to help retire $370 million of debt and preferred stock. We also delivered operating results that exceeded expectations while executing on our larger operational initiatives in both of our core plays. This included the expansion of our water-handling and disposal infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and the completion of our initial large-scale multipad development in the Eagle Ford Shale, which came online on schedule and has exhibited strong performance.\n“We remain focused on the synergistic development of our two core assets, on which we currently have more than a decade’s worth of highly-profitable drilling locations. The positions are complementary, as the Eagle Ford provides us with a high-return, quick-payback, free-cash-flow-generating asset while the Delaware Basin provides us with a high-potential growth engine. Additionally, their geographical proximity and operational similarities allow us to maximize our returns while minimizing risk as we can shift both drilling rigs and completion crews between the plays in order to avoid potential bottlenecks, take advantage of market opportunities, or optimize development activity. By implementing a steady development program across both assets, including a measured increase in activity over time, we believe we can generate double-digit production growth while improving our ROCE and moving toward a free-cash-flow-positive development program.\n“We continue to be very pleased with the results we have seen from our Delaware Basin position. During the first quarter, we delivered one of our best Wolfcamp B results to date from the Phantom area. The Griffin State 10H has recorded a peak 30-day rate of approximately 2,150 Boe/d on a restricted choke, with crude oil production of more than 1,150 Bbls/d. Production from the well has remained strong at approximately 2,000 Boe/d. With two of our three dedicated completion crews moving back to the Delaware Basin during the second quarter combined with the recent expansion of our water-handling capacity, we expect to deliver significant growth from our Delaware Basin asset during the remainder of the year.”\nOperational Update\nIn the Eagle Ford Shale, where the Company holds approximately 79,100 net acres, Carrizo drilled 11 gross (9 net) operated wells during the first quarter and completed 31 gross (26 net) operated wells. Production from the play was more than 35,600 Boe/d, down versus the prior quarter as expected due to the divestiture of more than 6,200 Boe/d of production associated with the Company’s downdip Eagle Ford Shale assets at the end of January as well as limited new wells being turned to sales during the quarter. Crude oil production during the first quarter was nearly 27,000 Bbls/d, accounting for more than 75% of the Company’s production from the play. At the end of the quarter, Carrizo had 20 gross (17 net) operated Eagle Ford Shale wells in progress or waiting on completion. Carrizo continues to expect to drill 60-65 gross (56-61 net) operated wells and complete 80-85 gross (71-76 net) operated wells in the play during 2018.\nInitial production from the Company’s first large-scale multipad project in the Eagle Ford Shale, located in its Brown Trust project area, began as scheduled at the end of March, and achieved the targeted plateau production rate in early April. Production from the multipad has recently averaged approximately 13,700 Boe/d (91% oil) on restricted chokes, with several wells achieving crude oil production rates of more than 1,000 Bbls/d each. The multipad consists of 16 wells on three pads, with an average lateral length of approximately 9,100 ft. and frac stage spacing of 150-180 ft. Carrizo holds an average working interest of 79% in the wells.\nIn the Delaware Basin, where the Company holds approximately 38,600 net acres, Carrizo drilled 10 gross (7 net) operated wells during the first quarter and completed 3 gross (2 net) operated wells. Production from the play was more than 15,200 Boe/d for the quarter, holding roughly flat with the prior quarter as forecasted while water-handling infrastructure initiatives were completed and brought online. Crude oil production was more than 6,900 Bbls/d, accounting for more than 45% of the Company’s production from the play. At the end of the quarter, Carrizo had 12 gross (10 net) operated Delaware Basin wells in progress or waiting on completion. Carrizo continues to expect to drill 33-38 gross (26-30 net) operated wells and complete 33-38 gross (25-29 net) operated wells in the play during 2018.\nCarrizo recently brought another strong Lower Wolfcamp B well online in its Phantom area. The Griffin State Unit 1922 10H began production in March, and has thus far achieved a peak 30-day rate of approximately 2,150 Boe/d (54% oil, 75% liquids) on a restricted choke from an approximate 9,750 ft. lateral. Carrizo holds an 80% working interest in the Griffin State well, which is the 12th Wolfcamp B well completed in the Company’s main Phantom area block.\nCarrizo has made significant progress on its water-handling initiatives in the Delaware Basin since the beginning of the year. During the first quarter, the Company’s 250,000 Bbl/d in-field water-handling system was brought online in the main part of the Phantom area. Complementary third-party disposal capacity upgrades were completed on schedule, increasing overall disposal capacity to approximately 125,000 Bbls/d currently; this should provide Carrizo with ample capacity to achieve its forecasted production ramp from the area. Additionally, Carrizo has currently received permits for operated water-disposal wells totaling 65,000 Bbls/d; these wells can be operational by early 2019 if needed. Using a combination of existing capacity, permitted Company-operated disposal wells, additional committed third-party capacity, and water recycling, Carrizo expects its total water-takeaway capacity to increase to more than 250,000 Bbls/d by mid-2019. This capacity is expected to satisfy Carrizo’s needs for the foreseeable future.\nCarrizo recently executed a firm transportation agreement on ONEOK’s Roadrunner pipeline, providing the Company with 40 MMcf/d of guaranteed takeaway capacity through November. This agreement provides certainty of flow on more than 90% of the Company’s current net natural gas production from the Phantom area. Additionally, Carrizo currently has 13,500 Bbls/d of guaranteed capacity on Oryx’s system, which increases to 25,000 Bbls/d later this year. These agreements, combined with the Company’s Midland-Cushing basis hedges, provide Carrizo with a significant amount of insulation from potential bottlenecks or basis blowouts during the year. Carrizo continues to evaluate additional firm transportation agreements for its natural gas as well as crude oil production from the Delaware Basin.\nBorrowing Base Update\nDuring May, Carrizo’s banking syndicate, led by Wells Fargo as administrative agent, completed its semi-annual borrowing base redetermination. In conjunction with this, the borrowing base under the Company’s senior credit facility was increased to $1.0 billion, and Carrizo has elected to increase the commitment amount to $900 million. Additionally, the interest rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings has been reduced by 50 bps, to LIBOR plus 150-250 bps. The next scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base is expected in the fall of 2018.\nHedging Activity\nCarrizo currently has hedges in place for approximately 75% of estimated crude oil production for the remainder of 2018 (based on the midpoint of guidance); the Company’s 2018 crude oil hedge portfolio includes both swaps and three-way collars. For 2019, the Company recently added 3,000 Bbls/d of three-way collars, bringing its total crude oil hedge position to 15,000 Bbls/d. Additionally, Carrizo has swap contracts in place for more than 50% and 35% of its estimated NGL and natural gas production, respectively, for the remainder of 2018.\nIn order to further manage its commodity price exposure, Carrizo has also put various basis hedges in place. For the balance of the year, Carrizo has basis swaps locking in a $0.10/Bbl Midland-Cushing differential on 6,000 Bbls/d. The Company also has basis swaps locking in a $2.91/Bbl LLS-Cushing premium on 6,000 Bbls/d over the same period.\nPlease refer to the attached tables for full details of the Company’s commodity derivative contracts.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss 2018 first quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 10:00 AM Central Daylight Time.

Items excluded are interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairments, dividends and accretion on preferred stock and items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results such as items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, for analysis of the Company’s financial and operating performance on a recurring basis and the Company’s ability to internally generate funds for exploration and development, and to service debt. In addition, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net income attributable to common shareholders, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of a company’s profitability or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
