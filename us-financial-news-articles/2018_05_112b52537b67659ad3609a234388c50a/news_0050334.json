The lease runs until 2040.\n“We are committed to a London HQ,” said Ben Almond, Pearson’s global head of property. “By becoming simpler and more efficient, we’re better able to invest, to innovate, to grow.”\nThe news follows moves by fellow corporate groups BT and Rolls-Royce to look for a new home after they both said they would move from their central London locations.\nAs part of its review, Pearson is also considering options for its One Southwark Bridge building, on the other side of the Thames and home to the Financial Times.\nPearson said it could either sublease its floors at its 80 Strand address and find an alternative London location, transfer its lease to an investor in a deal that includes the FT building or market One Southwark Bridge for sale or redevelopment.\nIf it fails to deliver any of those options it will stay in 80 Strand and review its portfolio again at a later date.\nPearson said it will have taken nearly 1 billion pounds of costs out of the company by 2020 since it started restructuring in 2013. It has also cut thousands of jobs.
