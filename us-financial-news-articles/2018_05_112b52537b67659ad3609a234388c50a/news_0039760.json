The space in which they work in is in some places shrinking.\n“If you then talk about women human rights defenders or those who defend LGBTI rights, the most marginalized ones, then the attacks are even worse ... that’s why we thought it was crucial to do this.”\nAmong those whose lives will be documented are Czech activist Elena Gorolová, who launched her campaign to end discrimination against Roma women after she was forcibly sterilized following the birth of her second son.\nAnother is Bridget Tolley, who co-founded a campaign group led by relatives of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada.\n“I have faced the impacts of colonialism, racism, economic exploitation, systemic abuse and hatred of women all my life,” said Tolley.\n“To have my work highlighted in a positive way means that our struggles and our resilience as indigenous women can no longer be ignored. We will not be silenced.”\nReporting by Meka Beresford @mekaberesford, Editing by Claire Cozens.
