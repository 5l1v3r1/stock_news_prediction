AOI available to common shareholders (1) was $61 million or $0.28 per diluted share.\n\"We delivered solid results in our first full reporting period following completion of the merger transaction,\" said Chris Littlefield, President and CEO of FGL Holdings. \"We are building momentum as a transformed company with increases in assets under management, net investment income, sales and earnings during this quarter. We recently completed a successful $550 million debt offering that will be used to support our growth and capital position, and refinance our outstanding senior notes at a significantly lower rate. Finally, we believe that the recent developments related to the 5th Circuit ruling that vacated the Department of Labor (DOL) rule and the Administration's decision not to seek review of that ruling is positive for our business and the independent agents who sell our products.\"\nAs a result of acquisition accounting (purchase accounting or PGAAP), financial results for periods after the closing of the merger transaction on November 30, 2017 are generally not comparable to the results of prior periods. Certain metrics, such as sales and policyholder account values, are not affected by PGAAP and are comparable to prior period data.

Sales of the company's core fixed indexed annuity (FIA) product in the current quarter of $436 million were on par with the prior year quarter. FIA sales decreased 6 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. We continued to see a robust competitive environment during the first quarter and reduced consumer appetite for safe money products given strong equity market performance.\nSales of multi-year guarantee annuities (MYGA) were $142 million in the current quarter, as compared to $158 million in the same period last year. During the quarter, we completed a $200 million funding agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank, under an investment spread strategy, compared to $136 million in the same period last year. The funding agreements are reflected as institutional spread based products and we view this volume as subject to fluctuation period to period.\nIndexed universal life (IUL) sales in the quarter were $6 million compared to $14 million last year. The decline in IUL sales reflects the company's focus on quality of new business and pricing discipline to achieve profitability and capital targets.\nInvestment Portfolio Performance\nThe investment portfolio is performing well and in line with operating objectives. Asset purchases during the first quarter were $3.7 billion at an average yield (7) of 4.99 percent. A large portion of asset purchases came from a $2.7 billion block trade completed in February 2018 as part of a planned portfolio repositioning. The block trade resulted in $40 million higher annualized net investment income and a yield improvement on those assets from 3.50 percent to 5.00 percent, or 150 basis points. Asset purchases and sales from the block trade were in corporate securities and the remaining $1.0 billion of asset purchases were investment grade corporate bonds and structured securities. Overall, the average NAIC rating for the portfolio is a stable at 1.6.\nAverage assets under management (AAUM) were $25.0 billion at March 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $0.2 billion over the sequential quarter. AAUM increased $4.8 billion compared to the prior year period due to net sales, as well as the mark-to-market valuation of the investment portfolio as of the date of the merger of approximately $1.2 billion, and the inclusion of acquired $1.9 billion Front Street Re and FGL Holdings. A roll forward of AAUM can be found in the non-GAAP measurements section of this release.\nNet investment income was $263 million in the first quarter of 2018, up $16 million or 6 percent from the prior year quarter. Net investment income grew from higher AAUM, partially offset by premium amortization related to the fair value mark on the investment portfolio resulting from the merger transaction. Net investment income was down $3 million or 1 percent from the sequential quarter, due to the full quarterly impact of noncash premium amortization and investment management agreement (IMA) fees, partially offset by net asset growth. The average earned yield on the total portfolio in the quarter was 4.21 percent, down approximately 70 basis points from the prior year quarter primarily due to the significant increase in AAUM and the impact of premium amortization noted above.\nNet investment spread across all product lines was 188 basis points in the first quarter of 2018 compared to an historical sequential quarter spread of 201 basis points. Spread trends primarily reflect the decline in portfolio yield due to purchase accounting effects and are otherwise stable. Net investment spread for fixed indexed annuities declined from approximately 267 basis points in the fourth quarter 2017 to 234 basis points in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to lower yield from purchase accounting. On a Statutory basis, the yield on the investment portfolio on an economic basis was approximately 5.0 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 5.1 percent in the prior period.\nCapital Management & Rating Trends\nGAAP book value per common share at March 31, 2018 was $5.87 on a reported basis; book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) was $7.17, with 214.4 million common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018. The Company continues to have a strong and stable capital position, with estimated statutory company action level risk-based capital (RBC) on an aggregate, combined basis for Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company and F&G Re Ltd of 480 percent as of March 31, 2018, including impacts of Tax Reform. On April 20, 2018, the Company closed on $550 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2025. The Company used the net proceeds to repay $135 million borrowings under its revolving credit facility and related expenses. The Company expects to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem and discharge all of the outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021 on May 16, 2018, and for general corporate purposes, which may include additional capital contributions to the Company's insurance subsidiaries.\nFGL HOLDINGS AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share data)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nASSETS\nInvestments:\nFixed maturity securities, available-for-sale, at fair value (amortized cost: March 31, 2018 - $21,738; December 31, 2017 - $21,475)\n$\n21,366\n$\n21,590\nEquity securities, at fair value (amortized cost: March 31, 2018 - $780; December 31, 2017 - $764)\n769\n761\nDerivative investments\n293\n492\nShort term investments\n—\n25\nCommercial mortgage loans\n528\n548\nOther invested assets\n276\n188\nTotal investments\n23,232\n23,604\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,157\n1,215\nAccrued investment income\n240\n211\nFunds withheld for reinsurance receivables, at fair value\n748\n756\nReinsurance recoverable\n2,495\n2,494\nIntangibles, net\n954\n856\nDeferred tax assets, net\n258\n176\nGoodwill\n476\n476\nOther assets\n105\n141\nTotal assets\n$\n29,665\n$\n29,929\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nContractholder funds\n$\n22,083\n$\n21,844\nFuture policy benefits, including $712 and $728 at fair value at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively\n4,711\n4,751\nLiability for policy and contract claims\n70\n78\nDebt\n307\n307\nRevolving credit facility\n135\n105\nOther liabilities\n717\n892\nTotal liabilities\n28,023\n27,977\nCommitments and contingencies\nShareholders' equity:\nPreferred stock ($.0001 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized, 377,417 and 375,000 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively)\n—\n—\nCommon stock ($.0001 par value, 800,000,000 shares authorized, 214,370,000 issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018\nand December 31, 2017, respectively)\n—\n—\nAdditional paid-in capital\n2,039\n2,037\n(Accumulated deficit) Retained earnings\n(119)\n(160)\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income\n(278)\n75\nTotal shareholders' equity\n1,642\n1,952\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$\n29,665\n$\n29,929\nFGL HOLDINGS AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nRevenues:\nPremiums\n$\n18\n$\n3\nNet investment income\n263\n247\nNet investment (losses) gains\n(191)\n81\nInsurance and investment product fees and other\n41\n44\nTotal revenues\n131\n375\nBenefits and expenses:\nBenefits and other changes in policy reserves\n(18)\n268\nAcquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals\n40\n33\nAmortization of intangibles\n16\n33\nTotal benefits and expenses\n38\n334\nOperating income\n93\n41\nInterest expense\n(6)\n(6)\nIncome before income taxes\n87\n35\nIncome tax expense\n(35)\n(13)\nNet income\n$\n52\n$\n22\nLess preferred stock dividend\n7\n—\nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n45\n$\n22\nNet income per common share\nBasic\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.38\nDiluted\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.38\nWeighted average common shares used in computing net income per common share:\nBasic\n214.4\n58.3\nDiluted\n214.4\n58.4\nCash dividend per common share\n$\n—\n$\n0.065\nRECONCILIATION OF BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE EXCLUDING AOCI\n(In millions, except per share data)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nReconciliation to total shareholders' equity:\nTotal shareholders' equity\n$\n1,642\n$\n1,952\nLess: AOCI\n(278)\n75\nLess: Preferred equity\n384\n377\nTotal common shareholders' equity excluding AOCI (1)\n$\n1,536\n$\n1,500\nTotal common shares outstanding\n214.4\n214.4\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n214.4\n214.4\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n214.4\n214.4\nBook value per common share including AOCI (1)\n$\n5.87\n$\n7.35\nBook value per common share excluding AOCI (1)\n$\n7.17\n$\n7.00\nROLLFORWARD OF AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (1) (AAUM) (Unaudited)\n(In billions)\nAAUM\nAAUM as of March 31, 2017\n$\n20.2\nPurchase accounting mark-to-market valuation of investment portfolio\n1.2\nInclusion of acquired Front Street Re and FGL Holdings\n1.9\nSales volumes\n1.4\nOther items\n0.3\nAAUM as of March 31, 2018\n$\n25.0\nFootnotes:\n(1)\nNon-GAAP financial measure.

See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for additional information.\nPurchase Accounting\nOn November 30, 2017, Fidelity & Guaranty Life completed its merger transaction with CF Corp, emerging as FGL Holdings. As of the merger date, the company applied the acquisition method of accounting (purchase accounting or PGAAP), including the initial recognition of most of FGL's and Front Street Re assets and liabilities at fair value, and the recognition of goodwill and other merger-related intangible assets. Prior period results are not restated for the new basis of accounting, which is used in the preparation of future financial statements and related disclosures.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included herein.\nThe Company updated its AOI definition as to remove the residual impacts of fair value accounting on its FIA products, including gains and losses on derivatives hedging those policies. Management believes the revised measure enhances the understanding of the business post-merger and is more useful and relevant to investors as compared to the previous definition which eliminated only the effects of changes in the interest rates used to discount the FIA embedded derivative.\nAOI is a non-GAAP economic measure we use to evaluate financial performance each period. AOI is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) to eliminate (i) the impact of net investment gains/losses including other than temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") losses recognized in operations, but excluding gains and losses on derivatives hedging our indexed annuity policies, (ii) the effect of changes in fair values of FIA related derivatives and embedded derivatives, net of hedging cost, (iii) the tax effect of affiliated reinsurance embedded derivative, (iv) the effect of integration, merger related & other non-operating items, (v) impact of extinguishment of debt, and (vi) net impact from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjustments to AOI are net of the corresponding impact on amortization of intangibles, as appropriate. The income tax impact related to these adjustments is measured using an effective tax rate of 21%, as appropriate. While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of the Company, market conditions and/or the non-recurring or non-operating nature of these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the core business. Accordingly, Management considers this to be a useful measure internally and to investors and analysts in analyzing the trends of our operations. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such non-GAAP measures in the same manner as we do.\nAOI available to common shareholders is a non-GAAP economic measure we use to evaluate financial performance attributable to our common shareholders each period. AOI available to common shareholders is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) available to common shareholders to eliminate (i) the impact of net investment gains including other than temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") losses recognized in operations, but excluding gains and losses on derivatives hedging our indexed annuity policies, (ii) the effect of changes in fair values of FIA related derivatives and embedded derivatives, net of hedging cost, (iii) the tax effect of affiliated reinsurance embedded derivative, (iv) the effect of integration, merger related & other non-operating items, (v) impact of extinguishment of debt, and (vi) net impact from Tax Cuts and Jobs act. All adjustments to AOI available to common shareholders are net of the corresponding impact on amortization of intangibles. The income tax impact related to these adjustments is measured using an effective tax rate of 21%, as appropriate. While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of FG, market conditions impacting these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the business. Accordingly, Management considers this to be a useful measure internally and to investors and analysts in analyzing the trends of our operations. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such non-GAAP measures in the same manner as we do.\nNet investment spread is the excess of net investment income earned over the sum of interest credited to policyholders and the cost of hedging our risk on FIA policies. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the performance of the Company's invested assets against the level of investment return, inclusive of hedging costs, provided to policyholders.\nAAUM is the sum of (i) total invested assets at amortized cost, excluding derivatives; (ii) related party loans and investments; (iii) accrued investment income; (iv) funds withheld at fair value; (v) the net payable/receivable for the purchase/sale of investments and (iv) cash and cash equivalents, excluding derivative collateral, at the beginning of the period and the end of each month in the period, divided by the total number of months in the period plus one. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the rate of return on assets available for reinvestment.\nInvestment book yield on bonds purchased during the period excludes yield on short-term treasuries and cash and cash equivalents. The Predecessor considered this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the level of returned on their income generating invested assets.\nCommon Shareholders' Equity is based on Total Shareholders' Equity excluding Equity Available to Preferred Shareholders. Management considers this to be a useful measure internally and to investors to assess the level of equity that is attributable common stock holders.\nCommon Shareholders' Equity Excluding AOCI is based on Common Shareholders Equity excluding the effect of AOCI. Since AOCI fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to unrealized changes in the fair value of available for sale investments, Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to provide useful supplemental information internally and to investors and analysts assessing the level of earned equity on common equity.\nBook Value per Common Share including and excluding AOCI is calculated as Common Shareholders' Equity and Common Shareholders Equity Excluding AOCI divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Management considers this to be a useful measure internally and for investors and analysts to assess the capital position of the Company.\nSales are not derived from any specific GAAP income statement accounts or line items and should not be viewed as a substitute for any financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP. For GAAP purposes annuity and IUL sales are recorded as deposit liabilities (i.e. contract holder funds). Management believes that presentation of sales as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business and helps depict longer term trends that may not be apparent in the results of operations due to the timing of sales and revenue recognition.\nWhile management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nConference Call and Earnings Release\nThis press release and the financial supplement will be posted to the Company's website at investors.fglife.bm .\nFGL Holdings will conduct a conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss first quarter 2018 results.\nThe event can be accessed the following ways:\nFor internet webcast, visit investors.fglife.bm/investors at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the call to register.
