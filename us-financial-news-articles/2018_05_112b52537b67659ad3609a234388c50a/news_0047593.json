The first two trains at Corpus Christi are expected to enter service next year.\nThe positive investment decision comes just days after the White House and China said a U.S. trade team would travel to China to explore new energy deals, prompting company executives to note that China could increase LNG imports to reduce its trade surplus with United States.\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:02:50.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
