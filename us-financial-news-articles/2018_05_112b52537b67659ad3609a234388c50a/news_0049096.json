The second group includes priests who also fell foul of the same disgraced churchman, the Vatican said.\nThe five men, accompanied by two other priests who have helped them and two lay people, will see the pope from June 1-3.\nIn a subsequent statement, the Diocese of Rancagua reported that the information was given to a prosecutor’s office and that, from the canonical point of view, the antecedents were sent to the Vatican.\n“We deeply regret any act or situation that violates the values ​​and principles that underpin our Catholic Church and we want to express our solidarity with the victims,” ​​said a statement later issued by the diocese.\nReporting by Antonio De La Jara, writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T07:04:16.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
