Related Coverage China surprised at White House trade statement - ministry\nChina has repeatedly said that it will push ahead with its development of high-tech industries and will not back down in the face of what it sees as threats from Washington.\nThe two countries earlier this month agreed to look at measures to reduce China’s trade surplus with the United States in a move that appeared to reduce the risk of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\nThat deal was separate from the U.S. investigation into China’s alleged theft of intellectual property.\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is to visit Beijing this week to try and get China to agree to firm numbers for additional U.S. exports to the country. The United States had wanted China’s trade surplus with America to shrink by $200 billion in two years, a figure seen as fanciful by most economists and trade experts.\nThere is room to increase exports to China by selling more agricultural commodities and energy products and China has agreed in principle to import more, but the two sides do not have a firm agreement.
