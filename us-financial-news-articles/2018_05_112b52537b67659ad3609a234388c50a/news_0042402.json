I am very happy where I am,” Rajan told reporters after an event in London hosted by the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, where he is a finance professor.\n“I think I’ve said all I can say. I’m not going to apply for a job anywhere, absolutely.”\nAsked what he would do if he were approached to fill the role, he said he had already answered a similar question.\nRajan was the RBI’s governor until September 2016 and has been mentioned by analysts as a possible future BoE governor after Mark Carney - who previously headed Canada’s central bank - steps down at the end of June 2019.
