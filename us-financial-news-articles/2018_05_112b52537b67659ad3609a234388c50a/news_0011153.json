Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Iran also have Caspian ports.\nThe new port also has container handling facilities and a polypropylene terminal which will handle products from a nearby plant which is set to be launched later this year.\nTurkmenistan does not report how much cargo its existing Caspian port currently handles.\nReporting by Marat Gurt; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov.
