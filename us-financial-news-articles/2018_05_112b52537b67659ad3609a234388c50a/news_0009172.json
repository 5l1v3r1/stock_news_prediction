The boxes are currently available in six states—Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Nevada, and Pennsylvania—with plans to roll them out nationwide starting in September, Thrillest reports .\nWhile bottled wine still holds the majority of the market share, the sale of boxed wine is on the rise. Boxed wine saw a growth of 15.2% last year and a growth of 13.7% in 2016 .\nBlack Box claims that its spirits will offer a 20% savings to customers over competing brands thanks to reduced packaging, production, and transportation costs. No word on where they stand as far as giving you that hangover.
