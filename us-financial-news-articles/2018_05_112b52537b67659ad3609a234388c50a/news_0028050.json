The company did not respond to a request seeking comment.\nWalker, in the blog, said she would not like the company’s ads to “accidentally end up in the wrong place, such as on a streaming video with sensitive content,” adding that the network gear maker will continue to use YouTube as a platform to share Cisco’s video content.\nAlphabet Inc’s Google, which owns YouTube, did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\nCisco's action follows a CNN report in April that said ads from over 300 companies, including Cisco, ran on extremist channels on YouTube. cnnmon.ie/2jOhAXZ\nThe companies may have unknowingly helped finance some of these channels through the advertisements they paid for YouTube, according to the CNN report.\nYouTube said in a report released last month that it had deleted about 5 million videos from its platform for content policy violations in last year’s fourth quarter before any viewers saw them.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://cnnmon.ie/2jOhAXZ", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:46:23.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
