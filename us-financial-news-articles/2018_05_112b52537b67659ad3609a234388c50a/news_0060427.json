According to the lawsuit, a lawyer for Disney told the estate the special's use of copyrighted music was \"fair use\" because of its documentary nature, an argument the estate called \"absurd.\"\n\"If Disney's position on fair use of the estate's copyrights were accepted, a network, studio or producer could make a documentary about Walt Disney, and spend most of the documentary's time using, without Disney's permission, extensive clips of Mickey Mouse, Walt Disney, and Disney movies,\" the lawsuit said.\nThe show employed \"at least 30 different copyrighted works,\" according to the lawsuit, including hit songs like \"Billie Jean\" and \"Thriller\" and video footage owned by the estate.\nJackson has led Forbes' list of the highest-earning dead celebrities five years running, with an estimated $75 million last year thanks to a Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas and a new posthumous album, among other sources of revenue.
