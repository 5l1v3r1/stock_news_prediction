(“The ONE Group” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: STKS), today announced the filing of a $100 million universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The new shelf registration statement will replace a similar registration statement declared effective by the SEC in May 2015.\nThe new registration statement is intended to provide The ONE Group with financial flexibility to raise capital over the next three years from the offering of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, units, rights, and debt securities, or any combination of these securities, in one or more future offerings. The new registration statement related to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the new registration statement becomes effective. Any offering of these securities will be made only by means of a written prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement relating to that offering. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nEmanuel “Manny” Hilario, Chief Executive Officer, said, “While we have no near-term identified uses for additional capital, this registration statement is part of our long-term planning to enhance financial flexibility to support our growth strategies.”\nAbout The ONE Group\nThe ONE Group (Nasdaq: STKS) is a global hospitality company that develops and operates upscale, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides hospitality management services for hotels, casinos and other high-end venues both nationally and internationally.
