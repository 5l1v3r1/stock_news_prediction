But plans for growth have been curbed as global sugar prices have plumbed multi-year lows due to swelling production in India and Thailand.\nBeet producers in the region have kept plantings stable compared with 2017/18. The lower end of the range assumes lower yields and potentially lower import figures, Becker said, noting imports are a swing factor.\n“I think we have seen the peak of EU exports,” he said.\nA previous record for EU exports was 6.9 million tonnes, prior to the introduction of the now-defunct quota system, Becker said.\nPrior to the end of the quota system, Suedzucker exported “small quantities” of just about 200,000 tonnes to local distributions, Becker said.\nSuedzucker expanded its unit for trading in advance of the 2017 policy shift, and exports jumped above 800,000 tonnes to the Middle East and Northern and Western Africa.
