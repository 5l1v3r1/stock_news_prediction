The defendants could be jailed for up to 10 years. Berger declined to comment on the case.\nFor years, government officials and prosecutors have been investigating cases across Germany of so-called dividend stripping, or “cum-ex” transactions.\nThe scheme involved buying a stock just before it loses rights to a dividend, then selling it, and illegally claiming a tax credit on both purchase and sale.\nThe case disclosed on Tuesday is expected to be the first of many in the months ahead.\nIn this particular case, the defendants are accused of conducting 61 sales of shares in companies listed on Germany’s blue-chip DAX index between 2006 and 2008, around the dividend payout days.\nThe trades, worth 15.8 billion euros ($18.6 billion), generated tax credit certificates that allowed the defendants to receive 106 million euros in illegal reimbursements, prosecutors said.\nNeither the prosecutors nor the Wiesbaden court identified the other five defendants by name, but the prosecutors said they included investment bankers from New Zealand and Britain.\nAll five worked for an unnamed large German bank based in Munich and London, the prosecutors said.
