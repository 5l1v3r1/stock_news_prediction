He added that steps in that direction might include imposing an “index cap”.\nSaudi officials have said that in addition to Riyadh, Aramco may list on one or more foreign markets.\nReporting by Andrew Torchia, Marwa Rashad; writing by Davide Barbuscia, editing by Ghaida Ghantous\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T11:49:56.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
