We also delivered significantly improved results in our liquid containment business, supported by the vibrant oil and gas market in Texas. Our Asia-Pacific region delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, driven by both higher leasing and sales revenues.”\nCharles Barrantes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “This quarter’s results mark the fifth consecutive quarter where we have delivered year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, and expect that positive momentum will continue into the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019.”\nThird Quarter 2018 Operating Summary\nNorth America\nRevenues from North American leasing operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 totaled $51.8 million, compared to $40.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of 27%. Leasing revenues increased by 31% on a year-over-year basis, most notably in the oil and gas, commercial and construction sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared with $9.4 million for the year-ago quarter, an increase of 62%. Adjusted EBITDA from Pac-Van and Lone Star increased by approximately 28% and 257% year-over-year, to $10.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively, from $8.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nNorth American manufacturing revenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 totaled $3.2 million and included intercompany sales of $0.9 million from products sold to our North American leasing operations. This compares to $1.7 million of total sales, including $0.7 million intercompany revenues during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. On a stand-alone basis, prior to intercompany adjustments, adjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million for the quarter, as compared to a loss of $0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nAsia-Pacific\nRevenues from the Asia-Pacific region for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 totaled $30.3 million, compared with $26.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of 13%. The increase in revenues occurred primarily in the utilities, construction, industrial, mining and special events sectors and were accompanied by a favorable foreign currency translation effect between periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the transportation sector. Leasing revenues increased by 12% on a year-over-year basis, most notably in the construction, mining and special events sectors. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2018 was $7.6 million, compared with $6.7 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 13%. On a local currency basis, revenues increased by 9% and adjusted EBITDA increased by 10%.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity Overview\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total debt of $439.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of $10.8 million, as compared to $355.6 million and $7.8 million at June 30, 2017, respectively. At March 31, 2018, our Asia-Pacific leasing operations had $18.1 million (A$23.5 million) available to borrow under its $96.1 million (A$125.0 million) credit facility, and our North American leasing operations had $35.4 million available to borrow under its $237 million credit facility.\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, the Company generated cash from operating activities of $32.9 million, as compared to $20.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, the Company invested a net $18.5 million ($16.0 million in North America and $2.5 million in the Asia-Pacific) in the lease fleet, as compared to $18.6 million in net fleet investment ($8.3 million in North America and $10.3 million in the Asia-Pacific) in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.\nReceivables were $53.2 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $44.4 million at June 30, 2017. Days sales outstanding in receivables at March 31, 2018, for our Asia-Pacific and North American leasing operations were 47 and 52 days, as compared to 49 and 46 days, respectively, as of June 30, 2017.\nOutlook\nBased on our year-to-date results, we now expect that consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of $335 million to $340 million and that consolidated adjusted EBITDA will increase by 39% to 41% in fiscal year 2018 from fiscal year 2017. This outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nConference Call Details\nManagement will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time (11:30 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company's operating results.

We calculate adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. In addition, in evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the expenses excluded from our presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. We present adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance and because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, many of which present EBITDA and a form of adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. The following tables show our adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation from net income (loss) on a consolidated basis and from operating income (loss) for our geographic segments (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 2017\n2018 Net income (loss) $ (1,071 ) $ (563 ) $ (445 ) $ 1,567 Add (deduct) — Provision (benefit) for income taxes (714 ) 228 (297 ) 519 Foreign currency exchange and other loss 164 1,852 70 4,906 Interest expense 5,249 9,398 15,096 24,667 Interest income (18 ) (43 ) (54 ) (81 ) Depreciation and amortization 10,044 10,131 29,831 30,123 Share-based compensation expense 651 889 842 2,986 Refinancing costs not capitalized 437 — 437 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,742 $ 21,892 $ 45,480 $ 64,687 Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Asia-Pacific North America Asia-Pacific North America Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Operating income (loss) $ 2,112 $ 3,079 $ (496 ) $ (1,202 ) $ 3,178 $ 9,299 $ (17 ) $ (1,694 ) Add - Depreciation and amortization 4,268 5,758 198 9 4,342 5,855 11 9 Impairment of goodwill and trade name --- --- --- ---- ---- ---- 117 ---- Share-based compensation expense 314 98 4 235 114 80 ---- 684 Refinancing costs not capitalized ---- 437 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,694 $ 9,372 $ (294 ) $ (958 ) $ 7,634 $ 15,234 $ 111 $ (1,001 ) Intercompany adjustments $ (72 ) $ (86 )\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2017 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 Asia-Pacific North America Asia-Pacific North America Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Operating income (loss) $ 8,931 $ 10,649 $ (1,847 ) $ (3,805 ) $ 10,232 $ 25,955 $ (680 ) $ (4,304 ) Add - Depreciation and amortization 12,294 17,490 594 19 12,837 17,382 346 27 Impairment of goodwill and trade name ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 117 ---- Share-based compensation expense (208 ) 265 48 737 1,321 273 26 1,355 Refinancing costs not capitalized ---- 437 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- Adjusted EBITDA $ 21,017 $ 28,841 $ (1,205 ) $ (3,049 ) $ 24,390 $ 43,610 $ (191 ) $ (2,922 ) Intercompany adjustments $ (124 ) $ (200 )\nSource:General Finance Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/75b79a88-d8c8-475d-a8b5-b2a8aab5e0d6", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HMIujguyWLWWvtGmILEr9pIUVHhrUoJ03uKKEgaaLWWc0b8J3pocTC3UXBNNEpvogM3Bs0mgdmvvSj5Ko1vYgoiSd2ABOR8gnFFzcmoPegzo2XxafYf7hsP2baBIKkvZ", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8RYrWxYV0_d-ez2Tdc03BXbM_NRI29msttjB-JsFesPX9LxQU-zUFHWgdALGkDROnqFxj_0keu6Qj3qV6xhhcJOXXQ4ppyy9sl9VT9X5mzg=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=E1lW5ow-vKvqfqjyfRZqwcorTkGh6ZcxNG47FiEKum2OLwpJB9wADFuYNXgU41iTNuk-jW4Gp_EJRrP87qlI3w==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PsGQqLi4Z_MdijzlYeqMf47Kxv626YLDaUN7gIQAa4gnqa0qbLIHYvViM2LhLJHRM0Ov8SnCuWbtls8FG1_QqwPGbt7AsT1YAehjoZ6ddRQ=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HMIujguyWLWWvtGmILEr9pIUVHhrUoJ03uKKEgaaLWUHYkYbxetwMJtZ2ctUlWHklRfwqKJpHISyGU2FS5u2MKKVmwj39TDSpVwmjTkMeIBxS3XPcww8kJfTng9Qh2Cb"], "published": "2018-05-09T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T16:23:35.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
