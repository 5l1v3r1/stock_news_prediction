(TSX:MNR; OTCQB: MSSNF – \"Mason\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise noted.\nQ1 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nNet loss for Q1 2018 was $0.3 million, which was a reduction of 57% from the comparative period of 2017 ($0.7 million net loss). Operating cash outflow after working capital movements for Q1 2018 was $0.1 million, which was a reduction of 85% from the comparative period of 2017 ($0.7 million cash outflow). The Company's cash balance at March 31, 2018 was $7.1 million with no debt.\nOUTLOOK AND STRATEGY\nCorporate\nThe Company's corporate focus going forward will be to maximize market value through assessing and executing on options to move its Ann Mason copper-molybdenum porphyry project (the \"Ann Mason Project\") in Nevada forward, possibly including introducing one or more strategic partners. In addition, Mason is undertaking a process to prioritize and progress other growth strategies involving its Lordsburg copper-gold porphyry property in New Mexico and additional potential new exploration acquisitions. Fiscal responsibility, including restricting cash expenditures to value adding activities, remains a high priority.\nThe Company expects to spend between $1.2 million and $1.4 million for the 2018 year, which includes $0.4 million for corporate costs, investor relations, and compliance and the balance related to the Ann Mason Project and Lordsburg property.\nAnn Mason Project\nThe Ann Mason Project is believed to be the 4th largest undeveloped copper porphyry resource in Canada/U.S.A. and remains open in several directions. On May 10, 2017, Mason filed its NI 43-101 technical report titled \"2017 Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Ann Mason Project, Nevada, U.S.A.\" (the \"2017 PEA\") on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . The Company is currently evaluating options for its Ann Mason Project, which may include optimizing certain aspects of the 2017 PEA, commencing a Pre-Feasibility study and testing high priority exploration targets with potential to provide alternative production options.\nThe Company is targeting expenditures of between $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the 2018 year, including claim fees and payments, site maintenance and local administration costs.\nLordsburg Property\nThe Company is managing the costs associated with the Lordsburg property while management evaluates the best path forward to add value to the project. Expenditures for 2018 are mainly for claim fees and local administration costs. The Company expects to spend approximately $0.1 million for the 2018 year.\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 unaudited consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company's website at www.MasonResources.com .\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe Company's Q1 2018 net loss of $0.3 million included $0.2 million of exploration costs and $0.3 million of general and administration costs, which were partially offset by $0.2 million foreign exchange gain.\nExploration expenses for Q1 2018 included costs of $0.1 million relating to the Ann Mason Project. Compared to the comparative 2017 and 2016 periods, the expenses were 17% and 43% lower, respectively, due to the moderation of exploration programs relating to the Ann Mason Project since 2016. Exploration expenses relating to the Lordsburg property during these periods were minimal.\nGeneral and administrative costs in Q1 2018 included costs of $0.2 million related to administrative and executive services through the Administrative Services Agreement (\"ASA\") with Entrée Resources Ltd. The expenses in the current year are comparable to the comparative period in 2017 but are 32% higher than the comparative period in 2016 due to the expenses incurred under the ASA.\nQUALIFIED PERSON\nRobert Cinits, P.Geo., Mason's Chief Operating Officer, a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"), has approved the technical information in this release.\nABOUT MASON RESOURCES CORP.\nMason Resources Corp. is a well-funded Canadian company focused on copper exploration and development in the U.S.A. The Company's key asset is its 100% owned Ann Mason Project – an extensive, prospective land package located in the Yerington District of Nevada. The Ann Mason Project hosts two copper-molybdenum porphyry deposits, Ann Mason and Blue Hill, as well as numerous earlier-stage or untested priority targets. The Ann Mason deposit is currently at a PEA level and is among the largest undeveloped copper porphyry resources in Canada/U.S.A. The excellent infrastructure, year-round access, strong community support and clear permitting process are all factors that contribute to making Yerington, Nevada one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world. Mason also holds a 100% interest in the Lordsburg property, an exciting earlier-stage copper-gold porphyry project, located within an historic mining district in New Mexico.\nMason's strong financial position and high-quality asset portfolio provide it with a solid foundation and flexibility for growth, by advancing development of Ann Mason towards Pre-Feasibility, introducing one or more strategic development partners, exploring high priority targets or considering strategic acquisitions.
