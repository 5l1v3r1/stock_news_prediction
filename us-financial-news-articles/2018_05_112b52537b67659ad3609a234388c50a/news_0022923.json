The company had in March 5.7 billion reais in debt, equivalent to 2 times its EBITDA over the last 12 months.\nRevenue rose as stock and derivatives markets posted record trading volumes, B3 Chief Executive Officer Gilson Finkelsztain said in a statement.\nIn a client note, Goldman Sachs’ analysts said were expecting B3 to reach EBITDA margin levels of 70 percent in the near future. The financial exchange operator posted a 68.4 percent EBITDA margin in Q1.
