It’s because there are bad apples within the industry,” he told Reuters. “AN OLD LAW”\nThe body had a duty to protect the public, he added. “Films must reflect the dominant values of the people. Films must promote morality in society.”\nBut filmmakers said the restrictions had not kept track with changing tastes and technology.\nLast month the board banned “Rafiki”, a film about two women falling in love, on the grounds that it promoted lesbianism - in violation of another colonial-era law.\n“It’s archaic ... it’s an old law. We need to now sit down and look at the situation and circumstances that are now in 2018 and see how best that law can work for us,” director David Gitonga said.\nHis latest film, “Disconnect” is a romantic comedy about young Kenyans exploring relationships and sexuality in Nairobi.\n“I’m all for paying for our licenses but let’s look at what are we paying for. You know that young upcoming kid who wants to make a film with his phone, let him be free to go shoot even in the city,” he added.\nThe law, which was created just before Kenya gained independence at the end of 1963, allows the government to “control the making and exhibition” of audio visual material including films.\nKenya’s film industry was worth $2 billion in 2016, up from 600 million in 2007, according to a study by the Kenya Film Commission.
