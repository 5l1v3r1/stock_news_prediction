It also faced significant currency headwinds.\nOriflame shares were down 16 percent at 343.80 Swedish crowns by 0730 GMT.\nSales in the CIS region, mainly Russia, fell 15 percent in the quarter, against growth of 15 percent in the same period last year.\n“We are taking measures where we meet sales challenges and remain confident in our long-term strategy,” Chief Executive Magnus Brannstrom said in a statement, without giving further details.\nGroup sales in the second quarter to date are down 2 percent in local currency, hit by timing of catalogues in the CIS and conferences in most regions, the company said.\nOriflame’s operating profit (EBIT) rose to 30.6 million euros ($36.7 million) in the quarter, from 29.8 million euros a year ago. That was below mean expectations of 33.3 million euros in a Reuters poll of three analysts.
