The Tokyo-based company had warned in February that a restructuring of the unit was likely.\nMultigrain reduced Mitsui’s full-year earnings by 47.7 billion yen, a company spokeswoman said.\nJapanese trading houses, including rival Marubeni Corp, aggressively invested in overseas grain businesses several years ago, but they are still struggling to generate targeted profits.\nOverall, Mitsui reported a 37 percent jump in consolidated net profit for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 418.5 billion yen on the back of higher prices of iron ore and coal.\n($1 = 108.9300 yen)\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:44:49.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
