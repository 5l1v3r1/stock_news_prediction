I want to go out there and be the best I can be.”\nJunior Seau played 20 years in the NFL, but took his own life in 2012 and was posthumously found to have the degenerative brain disease CTE. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015.\nWith CTE linked to repeated head trauma, Ian Seau is well aware of the risk of playing football. His mother, Mary Seau, started a foundation dedicated to raising awareness of the early warning signs of brain trauma.\n“I know (the NFL) is trying to find ways to make it safer,” he told the Daily News.\n“I’m just living out there, not really worried about that. I’m worried about what we’re doing on the next play.”\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T21:49:06.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
