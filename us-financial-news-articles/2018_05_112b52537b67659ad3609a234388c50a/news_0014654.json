(“Acadian” or the “Company”) (TSX:ADN) today reported financial and operating results 1 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (the “first quarter”).\n“Acadian posted a strong start to the year with operations benefiting from favourable winter conditions which supported seasonally strong log production. We believe we are well positioned to maintain this momentum through 2018”, commented Mark Bishop, Chief Executive Officer of Acadian. “We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 3% increase in Acadian’s quarterly dividend.”\nAcadian had a solid start to the year and posted strong performance for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. The Company generated Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $8.9 million for the first quarter, up from $8.0 million in the prior year, as our operations benefitted from favourable winter harvest conditions and strong seasonal demand that led to an increase in log sales volumes of 17% compared to the same quarter of 2017. Demand for most of our products continues to be solid with our weighted average log selling price per cubic meter remaining in-line with the first quarter of last year.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Acadian generated $7.3 million of Free Cash Flow 1 and declared dividends of $4.6 million to our shareholders. This represents a payout ratio of 63%, which is comfortably below our long-term annual target of 95% but in-line with expectations given the seasonality of our operations.\n1 This news release makes reference to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Free Cash Flow which are key performance measures in evaluating Acadian’s operations and are important in enhancing investors’ understanding of Acadian’s operating performance. Acadian’s management defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, fair value adjustments, recovery of or impairment of land and roads, unrealized exchange gain/loss on debt, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of its total revenue. Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest paid, current income tax expense, and capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of fixed assets (selling price less gains or losses included in Adjusted EBITDA). As these performance measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. As a result, we have provided in this news release reconciliations of net income, as determined in accordance with IFRS, to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Free Cash Flow. Operating Leadership Transition\nAcadian announced today the start of a retirement transition for Marcia McKeague, Vice President of Operations for Acadian’s Maine Timberlands since Acadian’s inception. Marcia will retire at the end of 2018 and in the interim period will continue to work with the Acadian team supporting the leadership transition, while also working on various strategic initiatives. Marcia has had a long, accomplished career spanning over 35 years and is a well-recognized professional forester in the State of Maine. “The entire management team would like to thank Ms. McKeague for her passionate dedication and significant contributions to Acadian”, commented Mr. Bishop.\nAcadian also announced that Luc Ouellet has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Operations assuming responsibility for the Maine operations in addition to his current New Brunswick responsibilities. Mr. Ouellet has served as Vice President of Acadian’s New Brunswick operations since the company’s inception. He is a Registered Professional Forester in both New Brunswick and Maine, a member of the Professional Engineer Association in New Brunswick and has been involved in managing timberlands for over 30 years.\n“I look forward to working with Luc and Marcia through the transition, and fully anticipate that the Maine and New Brunswick teams under Luc’s leadership will continue to apply their long-demonstrated spirit of innovation to secure Acadian’s safety, sustainable forest management and financial performance as “best in class””, added Mr. Bishop.\nReview of Operations\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\nThree Months Ended\n(CAD thousands, except per share information) March 31, 2018 March 25, 2017 Sales volume (000s m 3 ) 419.7 356.0 Net sales 1 $ 32,948 $ 28,012 Net income 1,986 4,758 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,870 $ 8,030 Free Cash Flow $ 7,258 $ 7,388 Dividends declared 4,601 4,601 Payout ratio 63 % 62 % Per share – basic and diluted Net income $ 0.12 $ 0.28 Free Cash Flow 0.43 0.44 Dividends declared 0.275 0.275 1. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation as a result of adoption of IFRS 15, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, on January 1, 2018\nFor the first quarter, Acadian generated net sales of $32.9 million, compared to $28.0 million in the comparable period of 2017, as favourable winter harvest conditions and strong demand for softwood sawlogs resulted in a 17% increase in total log sales volumes compared to the prior year. Acadian’s weighted average log selling price remained in-line with the prior year as the benefit from a demand-driven 5% increase in softwood sawlog prices was offset by changes in the sales mix.\nAs a result of the aforementioned increase in log sales volumes, which was partially offset by an increase in variable log harvest costs per m 3 , Adjusted EBITDA climbed to $8.9 million during the quarter from $8.0 million in the prior year. However, the Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 27% was down from 29% in the prior year due to reduced higher and better use land sales in Maine as well as timing of operating costs.\nNet income totaled $2.0 million, or $0.12 per share, for the first quarter, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same period in 2017 as the aforementioned increase in Adjusted EBITDA was more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange revaluation on Acadian’s U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt.\nAcadian’s balance sheet continues to be solid with $97.6 million of net liquidity as at March 31, 2018, including funds available under Acadian’s Revolving Facility and our stand-by equity commitment with Brookfield.\nTotal dividends declared to shareholders during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $4.6 million, or $0.275 per share, unchanged from the prior year.\nSegment Performance\nNew Brunswick Timberlands\nThe table below summarizes operating and financial results for New Brunswick Timberlands.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months Ended March 25, 2017 Harvest Sales Sales\nResults Harvest Sales Sales Results (000s m 3 ) (000s m 3 ) Mix ($000s) (000s m 3 ) (000s m 3 ) Mix ($000s) Softwood 158.6 157.4 54 % $ 8,885 135.3 126.5 47 % $ 7,258 Hardwood 93.0 83.0 28 % 6,566 115.3 94.7 36 % 7,602 Biomass 52.9 52.9 18 % 1,451 45.3 45.3 17 % 965 304.5 293.3 100 % 16,902 295.9 266.5 100 % 15,825 Timber services and other sales 1 6,218 5,428 Net sales 1 $ 23,120 $ 21,253 Adjusted EBITDA $ 5,857 $ 6,128 Adjusted EBITDA margin 25 % 29 % 1. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation as a result of adoption of IFRS 15, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, on January 1, 2018\nNet sales for our New Brunswick Timberlands totaled $23.1 million compared to $21.3 million in the prior year. Log sales volumes, excluding biomass, increased 9% to 240 thousand m 3 from 221 thousand m 3 in the first quarter of 2017 reflecting favourable harvest conditions, particularly for spruce and fir stands, strong seasonal demand for softwood sawlogs, and improved demand for softwood pulpwood. In addition, timber services and other sales increased 15% compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of harvest activities.\nThe weighted average log selling price during the quarter was $64.28 per m 3 , down from $67.19 per m 3 in the prior year. Demand for softwood sawlogs in New Brunswick remained strong with prices increasing 2%, however this was more than offset by lower relative volumes of higher-valued hardwood pulpwood and higher relative volumes of lower-valued softwood pulpwood. Prices for these products remained in-line with the prior year.\nBiomass product sales volumes increased by 17% year-over-year as shipments to export markets have recently resumed. The return of the export markets also resulted in a 26% increase in gross margin earned compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating costs for the quarter were $17.3 million, compared to $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher harvest volumes and the timing of timber services and other sales. Variable log harvest costs per m 3 increased 4% primarily due to longer hauling distances and increased fuel costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $5.9 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.1 million in the prior year, as the impact of the aforementioned increase in log sales volumes were more than offset by lower weighted average log selling prices and higher variable harvest costs per m 3 . Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 25% for the quarter from 29% during the same period in the prior year.\nThere was one minor recordable safety incident among employees and none among contractors during the first quarter of 2018 at our New Brunswick Timberlands.\nMaine Timberlands\nThe table below summarizes operating and financial results for Maine Timberlands.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months Ended March 25, 2017 Harvest Sales Sales Results Harvest Sales Sales Results (000s m 3 ) (000s m 3 ) Mix ($000s) (000s m 3 ) (000s m 3 ) Mix ($000s) Softwood 91.6 91.2 72 % $ 7,321 62.8 62.6 70 % $ 4,751 Hardwood 33.9 30.7 24 % 2,254 29.4 25.7 29 % 1,892 Biomass 4.5 4.5 4 % 7 1.2 1.2 1 % 2 130.0 126.4 100 % 9,582 93.4 89.5 100 % 6,645 Other sales 246 114 Net sales $ 9,828 $ 6,759 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,464 $ 2,156 Adjusted EBITDA margin 35 % 32 % Net sales totaled $9.8 million compared to $6.8 million for the same period last year as log sales volumes increased meaningfully to 122 thousand m 3 from 88 thousand m 3 in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by strong seasonal demand for softwood sawlogs, which had been impacted in the prior year by high customer inventories and limited markets for sawmill residuals, as well as an increase in the number of operating days in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same quarter of 2017.\nThe weighted average log selling price in Canadian dollar terms was $78.51 per m 3 , up from $75.26 per m 3 in the same period of 2017. The weighted average log selling price in U.S. dollar terms was $62.09 per m 3 , up 9% year-over-year, reflecting improved demand for softwood sawlogs and hardwood pulpwood as well as a favourable change in log sales product mix.\nCosts for the first quarter were $6.3 million, compared to $5.1 million during the same period in 2017 due to increased log sales volumes which were partially offset by a 6% decrease in variable log harvest costs per m 3 due to shorter hauling distances and foreign exchange.\nAs a result of the aforementioned factors, Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.5 million compared to $2.2 million in the prior year and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 35%, relative to 32% in 2017.\nThere were no recordable safety incidents among employees or contractors during the first quarter of 2018 at our Maine Timberlands.\nAdoption of IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers\nIFRS 15 supersedes previous revenue standards (IAS 18, Revenue) and related interpretations and it applies to all revenue arising from contracts with customers. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 15 using the full retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2018 resulted in a change in presentation from net to gross for timber services, which does not impact the Company’s operating earnings or net income. As a result of this change in presentation, net sales for the three-month period ended March 25, 2017 increased by $4.9 million, with a corresponding increase in operating costs and expenses. Net sales are net of discounts and rebates to customers. Revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer, which is generally when timber is delivered to the customer and actual quantities delivered are determined. Sales are governed primarily by contract and in some cases by standard industry terms. Pursuant to the Crown Lands Services Agreement, Acadian provides harvesting, transportation and other services to Crown licensees and sub-licensees. Acadian receives payment for these services which are recognized upon delivery of the timber and when actual quantities delivered are determined.\nMarket Outlook\nThe following contains forward-looking statements about Acadian Timber Corp.’s market outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018. Reference should be made to the “Forward-looking Statements” section of this news release. For a description of material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in the following, please see the Risk Factors section of our management’s discussion and analysis of Acadian’s most recent Annual Report and Annual Information Form available on our website at www.acadiantimber.com or filed with SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nAcadian’s key markets include softwood sawtimber, hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood. Northeast North American softwood dimension sawmills represent over one third of Acadian’s end-use market and are the primary market for our softwood sawtimber. Economic forecasters continue to call for steady growth in U.S. housing starts, with year-over-year improvements averaging over 7% in 2018 and 5% in 2019. While tight construction labour markets and declining housing affordability may present headwinds, the underlying fundamental driver of pent-up household formation remains highly compelling. Further encouraging is the transitioning mix in the U.S. to a higher and more typical single family home proportion of starts which consume significantly greater volumes of wood per start. As a result, North American sawtimber demand is expected to grow at over 4% per year over the next few years to support expanding domestic construction needs.\nBenchmark SPF and SYP lumber prices were up over the sequential quarter by 11% and 24%, respectively, passing on the full application of 20.23% average export duties on U.S.-bound shipments to consumers. However, while the duties were a factor in higher prices, the combination of robust demand and supply constraints including severe winter conditions and tight rail and truck transport availability were important factors driving pricing gains. While lumber pricing volatility should be expected due to uncertainty of ongoing application and pass through of duties or a potential future softwood lumber dispute settlement including quotas, forecasters anticipate the underlying supply demand drivers will continue to support strength in lumber pricing through 2019. By extension, Acadian anticipates continued strong support in end use markets for softwood sawtimber pricing through this period.\nSince the final determination of combined duties were announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce and finalized by the International Trade Commission in late Q4 2017, industry officials indicate there have been no material softwood negotiations between the U.S. and Canada. As there is little expectation that a softwood settlement will factor into the current broader NAFTA trade negotiations, there remains little visibility on relief from duties in the near to medium term.\nHardwood sawtimber markets, typically oriented to millwork and higher value specialty markets, are expected to remain at healthy current levels throughout the remainder of the year. While hardwood pulpwood markets remain historically very strong, we expect seasonally high consumer inventories will continue to impact log pricing through mid-year. While continued oversupply of softwood sawmill residuals and softwood pulpwood markets remains a concern, regional timberland owners have continued to operate with reduced pulpwood harvest which we expect will continue though the remainder of the year. In New Brunswick, biomass markets have benefitted from the gradual recovery in export volumes which we expect will continue through the second half of the year.\nQuarterly Dividend\nAcadian is pleased to announce a dividend of $0.2825 per share, payable on July 13, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2018.\nAcadian Timber Corp. is a leading supplier of primary forest products in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S. With a total of 2.4 million acres of land under management, Acadian is the third largest timberland operator in New Brunswick and Maine.\nAcadian owns and manages approximately 1.1 million acres of freehold timberlands in New Brunswick and Maine, and provides timber services relating to approximately 1.3 million acres of Crown licensed timberlands in New Brunswick. Acadian also owns and operates a forest nursery in Second Falls, New Brunswick. Acadian's products include softwood and hardwood sawlogs, pulpwood and biomass by-products, sold to approximately 85 regional customers.\nAcadian’s business strategy is to maximize cash flows from its existing timberland assets while growing our business by acquiring assets on a value basis and utilizing our operations-oriented approach to drive improved performance.\nAcadian’s shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ADN.\nFor further information, please visit our website at www.acadiantimber.com or contact:\nJon Syrnyk\nInvestor Relations\nTel: 604-661-9622\nEmail: jsyrnyk@acadiantimber.com\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis News Release contains forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Acadian Timber Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Acadian”), or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
