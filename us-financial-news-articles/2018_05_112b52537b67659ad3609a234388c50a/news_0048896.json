We also advanced our multi-media capabilities in 2017, most notably through a commitment to digital innovation, expanding our capabilities and launching a more expansive LaMusica app. These efforts drove increased share among key audience demographics including Hispanic millennials. Moving forward, the entire SBS team is sharply focused on building upon our successes to date. Our goals in the year ahead include additional aggregate audience share growth and the delivery of compelling multi-platform experiences to our listeners and integrated advertising opportunities to our brand partners.\"\nOur Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\nWe have not repaid our outstanding 12.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the \"Notes\") since they became due on April 17, 2017, and continue to evaluate all options available to refinance the Notes. While we assess how to best achieve a successful refinancing of the Notes, we have continued to pay interest on the Notes, payments that a group of investors purporting to own our 10 3/4% Series B Cumulative Exchangeable Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series B preferred stock\") have challenged through the institution of litigation in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint filed by these investors revealed a purported foreign ownership of our Series B preferred stock, which we are actively addressing, including before the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") in order to protect our broadcast licenses. Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex by the Series B preferred stock litigation and foreign ownership issue. We provide more information about each of these items in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe have worked and continue to work with our advisors regarding a consensual recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including through the issuance of new debt or equity to raise the necessary funds to repay the Notes. The Series B preferred stock litigation and the foreign ownership issue have complicated our efforts at a successful refinancing of the Notes. We believe that the delay in refinancing the Notes has adversely affected us, including because we have been paying substantially more in interest expense on our outstanding Notes than would be the case if we refinanced them in the current market based on the feedback we have received from several financial institutions and potential sources of capital; there is a cloud on title regarding who validly owns our Series B preferred stock, which has created uncertainty as to who owns these shares, and the parties with whom the Company could potentially negotiate a consensual restructuring; we are incurring higher legal costs than otherwise would be the case due to our efforts to resolve the situation in general, to defend ourselves against the Series B preferred stock litigation and to address the foreign ownership issue before the FCC; the trading price of our common stock and preferred stock has been materially adversely affected; our ability to attract interest from investment banks and third party capital suppliers has been materially adversely affected; our reputation has been similarly negatively affected as a general matter despite our diligent efforts to resolve the situation; and the negativity and complexity surrounding our situation has been an unfortunate distraction from our otherwise successful business, notwithstanding the decrease in consolidated net revenue and operating income for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and the negative impact that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have had on us. The resolution of the recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, the litigation with the purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue are subject to several factors currently beyond our control. Our efforts to effect a consensual refinancing of the Notes, the Series B preferred stock litigation and the foreign ownership issue will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on us if they are not successfully resolved. We face various risks regarding these matters which are summarized in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nQuarter End Results\nFor the quarter-ended December 31, 2017, consolidated net revenues totaled $36.4 million compared to $42.1 million for the same prior year period, resulting in a decrease of $5.7 million or 14%. Our radio segment net revenues decreased $6.8 million or 18%, due to decreases in local, national, network, barter, special events and digital sales. Our local sales decreased in our New York, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles markets. Our television segment net revenues increased $1.1 million or 25%, due to the receipt of a non-broadcast subscriber based revenue true-up payment offset by a decrease in local sales.\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA, a non-GAAP measure, totaled $13.3 million compared to $18.7 million for the same prior year period, representing a decrease of $5.4 million or 29%. Our radio segment Adjusted OIBDA decreased $7.1 million or 35%, primarily due to the decrease in net revenues of $6.8 million and an increase in operating expenses of $0.3 million. Radio station operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in compensation & benefits, professional fees and legal settlements offset by decreases in sales commissions, transmitter costs and barter expenses. Our television segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $1.9 million, due to the increase in net revenues of $1.1 million and decreases in operating expenses of $0.8 million. Television station operating expenses decreased primarily due to increases in production tax credits which offset original produced content production costs, and decreases in production costs, commissions and professional fees offset by an increase in barter expenses. Our corporate expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, increased $0.2 million or 7%, mostly due to an increase in legal expenses.\nOperating income totaled $14.4 million compared to $17.4 million for the same prior year period, representing a decrease of $3.0 million or 17%. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to decreases in net revenues, increases in recapitalization costs and corporate expenses offset by the gain on the sale of spectrum assets and decreases in operating expenses.\nYear End Results\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2017, consolidated net revenues totaled $134.7 million compared to $144.6 million for the same prior year period, resulting in a decrease of $9.9 million or 7%. Our radio segment net revenues decreased $10.0 million or 8%, due to decreases in local, national and network sales which were offset by increases in special event revenues. Our special events revenue increase occurred primarily in our Los Angeles and San Francisco markets. Our television segment net revenues increased $0.1 million or 1%, due to the receipt of a non-broadcast subscriber based revenue true up payment offset by a decrease in local revenues.\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA, a non-GAAP measure, totaled $35.2 million compared to $47.5 million for the same prior year period, resulting in a decrease of $12.3 million or 26%. Our radio segment Adjusted OIBDA decreased $13.8 million or 24%, primarily due to the decrease in net revenues of $10.1 million and increase in operating expenses of $3.7 million. Radio station operating expenses primarily increased due to increases from managing special events through thirds parties to mitigate related exposure, taxes and licenses, AIRE network-affiliate station compensation, legal settlements, bad debt and facilities expenses offset by decreases in transmission costs and sales related commissions and bonuses. Our television segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $1.8 million, due to the decrease in station operating expenses of $1.7 million and the increase in net revenues of $0.1 million. Television station operating expenses decreased primarily due to an increase in production tax credits which offset originally produced content production costs and decreases in barter, professional fees and commission expenses. Our corporate expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, increased $0.3 million or 3% primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and airline charters to provide humanitarian relief to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria offset by decreases in professional fees.\nOperating income totaled $40.5 million compared to $42.1 million for the same prior year period, representing a decrease of $1.6 million or 4%. This decrease in operating income was mainly due to the decrease in net revenue and increases in recapitalization costs, selling, general and administrative, and corporate expenses offset by the gains on the sale of the Los Angeles facility and spectrum assets.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2017 financial results on Friday, May 25, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

However, we believe that this measure is useful in evaluating our performance because it reflects a measure of performance for our stations before considering costs and expenses related to our capital structure and dispositions. This measure is widely used in the broadcast industry to evaluate a company's operating performance and is used by us for internal budgeting purposes and to evaluate the performance of our stations, segments, management and consolidated operations. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Operating Income, Net Income, Cash Flows from Operating Activities or any other measure used in determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted OIBDA does not present station operating income as defined by our Indenture governing the Notes. In addition, because Adjusted OIBDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nIncluded below are tables that reconcile Adjusted OIBDA to operating income (loss) for each segment and consolidated operating income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017\n(Unaudited and in thousands)\nConsolidated\nRadio\nTelevision\nCorporate\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n13,254\n12,976\n2,898\n(2,620)\nLess expenses excluded from Adjusted OIBDA but included\nin operating income (loss):\nStock-based compensation\n12\n—\n—\n12\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,019\n445\n543\n31\nGain on the disposal of assets, net\n(3,067)\n268\n(3,318)\n(17)\nRecapitalization costs\n847\n—\n—\n847\nOther operating gains\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOther operating income\n(3)\n—\n—\n(3)\nOperating Income (Loss)\n$\n14,446\n12,263\n5,673\n(3,490)\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2016\n(Unaudited and in thousands)\nConsolidated\nRadio\nTelevision\nCorporate\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n18,676\n20,115\n1,006\n(2,445)\nLess expenses excluded from Adjusted OIBDA but included\nin operating income (loss):\nStock-based compensation\n96\n—\n—\n96\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,144\n485\n563\n96\nGain on the disposal of assets, net\n(8)\n(8)\n—\n—\nRecapitalization costs\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOther operating gains\n(11)\n—\n—\n(11)\nOther operating income\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOperating Income (Loss)\n$\n17,455\n19,638\n443\n(2,626)\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\n(Unaudited and in thousands)\nConsolidated\nRadio\nTelevision\nCorporate\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n35,154\n42,843\n2,566\n(10,255)\nLess expenses excluded from Adjusted OIBDA but included\nin operating income (loss):\nStock-based compensation\n148\n—\n—\n148\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,349\n1,834\n2,218\n297\nGain on the disposal of assets, net\n(15,894)\n(12,558)\n(3,319)\n(17)\nRecapitalization costs\n6,021\n—\n—\n6,021\nOther operating gains\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOther operating income\n(3)\n—\n—\n(3)\nOperating Income (Loss)\n$\n40,533\n53,567\n3,667\n(16,701)\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\n(Unaudited and in thousands)\nConsolidated\nRadio\nTelevision\nCorporate\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n47,468\n56,603\n789\n(9,924)\nLess expenses excluded from Adjusted OIBDA but included\nin operating income (loss):\nStock-based compensation\n655\n(9)\n—\n664\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,692\n1,905\n2,378\n409\nGain on the disposal of assets, net\n(11)\n(11)\n—\n—\nRecapitalization costs\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOther operating gains\n(37)\n—\n—\n(37)\nOther operating income\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOperating Income (Loss)\n$\n42,169\n54,718\n(1,589)\n(10,960)\nNon-GAAP Reporting Requirement under our Senior Secured Notes Indenture\nUnder the Indenture, we are to provide our Noteholders a statement of our \"Station Operating Income for the Television Segment,\" as defined by the Indenture, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and a reconciliation of \"Station Operating Income for the Television Segment\" to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
