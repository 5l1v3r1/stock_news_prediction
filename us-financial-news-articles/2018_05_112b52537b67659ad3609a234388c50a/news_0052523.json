Newcastle made 10 first-half metres while Exeter made 368. The only disappointing aspect was that they managed only two tries to lead 16-0, though they cut loose in the second half to complete the crushing win.\nThere was no complacency, though, as Lachlan Turner charged down the conversion of Newcastle’s sole try.\n“Next week it will be those small things that make a difference,” said loose forward Don Armand, one of the four survivors from last year’s final.\nArmand and his team mates know that they will need to be even better against a Saracens team who, in the first 20 minutes against Wasps, played “as well as we’ve ever played” according to director of rugby Mark McCall.\nWasps captain Joe Launchbury admitted: “We just couldn’t handle them.”\nWhen Wasps did eventually get a toe-hold Saracens showed that they also knew how to create tries with pace and invention, eventually scoring six to the visitors’ five in a game of almost non-stop attacking.\nOwen Farrell converted all six and added five from five penalties and, with his distribution and organisation getting better by the week, Exeter know they need to find a way to minimise the new England captain’s influence.\nHaving been dethroned as back-to-back European champions this year, Saturday’s final is unquestionably the peak of Saracens’ season and though they are marginal bookmakers’ favourites, Exeter will absolutely not feel like underdogs.\nBoth teams are brimming with confidence and quality and there will surely be nobody in a sold-out Twickenham yearning for the good old days when the season would have dribbled to an anti-climactic close three weeks ago.
