(NYSE: NWHM) today announced results for the 2018 first quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights Compared to First Quarter 2017\nTotal revenues of $123.2 million vs. $125.0 million Home sales revenue of $79.4 million, up 14%; deliveries up 56% Net new home orders up 12% Backlog units up 39% Ending community count up 29% to 18 compared to 14\n“During the first quarter, The New Home Company continued to make progress in laying the groundwork to achieve its 2018 goals and position the Company for the future,” said The New Home Company’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Webb. “Home closings were up 56% year-over-year, quarter ending backlog increased 39% on a unit basis, and net new orders grew 12%. New order growth was somewhat impacted by delayed community openings in the quarter, which resulted in partial-quarter contributions from a handful of communities. Fortunately, we were able to work through these delays and saw an acceleration in sales activity in April, which resulted in year-over-year order growth of 71% for the month, or an absorption rate of 3.4 per month. Wholly owned lot count at the end of the first quarter increased by 75% over last year as we expanded our product portfolio in Arizona, Northern California and the Inland Empire in Southern California.”\nMr. Webb continued, “The housing fundamentals in California and Arizona continue to be solid, with healthy job growth and low levels of existing inventory in both states. We continue to pursue a strategy of product differentiation at a number of price points, which we believe will appeal to a deeper pool of buyers and increase long-term value for shareholders. This strategy, combined with favorable housing fundamentals, have me excited about the outlook for The New Home Company in 2018 and beyond.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nTotal revenues for the 2018 first quarter were $123.2 million, compared to $125.0 million in the prior year period. The net loss attributable to the Company was $0.6 million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a 120 basis point decline in home sales gross margin, a 120 basis point increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue, and a decrease in fee building revenues and margin. These items were partially offset by a 14% increase in home sales revenue and income tax benefits related to the 2018 first quarter pretax loss and discrete tax items.\nWholly Owned Projects\nHome sales revenue for the 2018 first quarter increased 14% to $79.4 million, compared to $69.4 million in the prior year period. The increase in home sales revenue was driven by a 56% increase in deliveries, which was partially offset by a 26% lower average selling price of homes delivered to $946,000 due to the strategic initiative to expand our portfolio to include more affordably-priced product and grow community count.\nGross margin from home sales for the 2018 first quarter was 12.3% as compared to 13.5% in the prior year period. The 120 basis point decline in home sales gross margin was primarily due to a product mix shift and higher interest costs. The mix shift was impacted by 2017 first quarter deliveries from a higher-margin Crystal Cove community in Newport Coast, CA and our Santa Clara community in the Bay Area, both of which closed-out during 2017. Adjusted gross margin from home sales for the 2018 first quarter, excluding interest in cost of home sales, was flat with the prior year period at 15.7%*.\nOur SG&A expense ratio as a percentage of home sales revenue for the 2018 first quarter was 15.9% versus 14.5% in the prior year period. The 140 basis point increase in the SG&A rate was primarily due to higher selling and marketing costs related to the ramp up of new communities, higher co-broker commissions, and a lower amount of G&A expenses allocated to the fee building business due to lower fee revenues.\nNet new home orders for the 2018 first quarter were up 12% to 141 homes, compared to 126 homes in the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by a 13% increase in average selling communities during the quarter. The Company's monthly sales absorption rate for the 2018 first quarter was flat with the prior year period at 2.8 sales per average selling community. The Company’s ending active selling community count was up 29% as of the end of the 2018 first quarter as compared to the year ago period end. The Company's cancellation rate for the 2018 first quarter remained at the lower end of the industry at 6% as compared to 7% in the prior year period.\nThe dollar value of the Company's wholly owned backlog at the end of the 2018 first quarter was $228.1 million and totaled 210 homes, compared to $313.9 million and 151 homes in the prior year period. The decrease in backlog dollar value resulted from a 48% lower average selling price of homes in backlog at $1.1 million as compared to $2.1 million a year ago. The year-over-year decline in the Company's average selling price of homes in backlog was driven primarily by the mix of homes in backlog in Southern California. The 2017 first quarter backlog included homes from two higher-priced luxury communities located in Newport Coast, CA that closed out in 2017.\nFee Building Projects\nFee building revenue for the 2018 first quarter decreased 21% to $43.8 million, compared to $55.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fee building construction activity. Our fee building gross margin was $1.1 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year period. The lower fee building gross margin was the result of lower fee revenues and a change in the fee building business arrangements. Management fees from joint ventures were $1.0 million during the 2018 first quarter compared to $1.2 million in the prior year period.\nUnconsolidated Joint Ventures (JVs)\nThe Company’s share of joint venture income was $0.3 million for the 2018 first quarter, up slightly from the prior year period, and was driven primarily by deliveries from our Mountain Shadows community in Paradise Valley, AZ.\nThe following sets forth supplemental information about the Company’s joint ventures. Such information is not included in the Company’s financial data for GAAP purposes but is provided for informational purposes.\nJoint venture net income totaled $0.8 million, compared to a net loss of $0.9 million in the prior year period. Joint venture home sales revenue totaled $31.2 million, compared to $25.1 million in the prior year period, while joint venture land sales revenue totaled $0.8 million for the 2018 first quarter, compared to $1.5 million in the prior year period.\nAt the end of the 2018 first quarter, our joint ventures had seven actively selling communities compared to nine at the end of the 2017 first quarter. Net new home orders from joint ventures for the 2018 first quarter decreased 8% to 36 homes as compared to 39 homes in the prior year period. The dollar value of homes in backlog from joint ventures at the end of the 2018 first quarter was $67.2 million from 84 homes, compared to $64.0 million from 69 homes in the prior year period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded a $0.9 million income tax benefit for the 2018 first quarter, which included a $0.4 million benefit for discrete items related primarily to energy tax credits that were extended in February 2018, compared to a tax provision of $0.5 million in the prior year period. The Company's effective tax rate was 56.9%, 29.4%* before discrete items, as compared to 38.5%, 38.2%* before discrete items, in the 2017 first quarter. The year-over-year decrease in rate before discrete items was the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017 that reduced the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21%, effective for 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had real estate inventories totaling $459.4 million, of which $381.8 million represented work-in-process and completed homes (including models), $41.7 million in land and land under development, and $35.9 million in land deposits and pre-acquisition costs. The Company owned or controlled 2,924 lots through its wholly owned operations (excluding fee building and joint venture lots), of which 1,768 lots, or 60%, were controlled through option contracts. The Company ended the 2018 first quarter with $91.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and had no borrowings outstanding under its $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company ended the 2018 first quarter with $319.0 million in debt outstanding (net of unamortized discount, premium and debt issuance costs), a debt-to-capital ratio of 55.1% and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 46.7%*.\nGuidance\nThe Company's current estimate for full year guidance for 2018 is as follows:\nHome sales revenue of $600 - $640 million Fee building revenue of $120 - $150 million Home sales gross margin of 14.5% - 15.0% Income from unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.5 million Wholly owned active year-end community count of 19 Joint venture active year-end community count of 6\nThe Company's current estimate for the 2018 second quarter is as follows:\nHome sales revenue of $100 - $120 million Fee building revenue of $30 - $40 million Income from unconsolidated joint ventures of $0.2 million Wholly owned active quarter-end community count of 20 Joint venture active quarter-end community count of 7\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018 to review first quarter results, discuss recent events and results, and discuss the Company's updated full year and certain quarterly guidance for 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA means net income (loss) (plus cash distributions of income from unconsolidated joint ventures) before (a) income taxes, (b) interest expense, (c) amortization of previously capitalized interest included in cost of sales or other expense, (d) noncash impairment charges and abandoned project costs, (e) gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, (f) depreciation and amortization, (g) amortization of equity-based compensation and (h) income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue for a given period. The ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total interest incurred is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total interest incurred for a given period. The ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing debt at the period end by Adjusted EBITDA for a given period. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing debt at the period end less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash by Adjusted EBITDA for a given period. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA assists investors in understanding and comparing the operating characteristics of homebuilding activities by eliminating many of the differences in companies' respective capitalization, interest costs, tax position and level of impairments. Due to the significance of the GAAP components excluded, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage, the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total interest incurred, the ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA, and the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the following table.\nThree Months Ended LTM (1) Ended Year Ended March 31, March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Net income (loss) $ (651 ) $ 836 $ 15,654 $ 22,631 $ 17,141 Add: Interest amortized to cost of sales and equity in net income of unconsolidated joint ventures 2,795 1,551 12,301 6,234 11,057 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (860 ) 524 14,006 13,790 15,390 Depreciation and amortization 1,022 123 1,348 509 449 Amortization of equity-based compensation 842 611 3,034 3,097 2,803 Cash distributions of income from unconsolidated joint ventures 715 1,588 715 5,330 1,588 Noncash impairments and abandonments 35 34 2,584 3,965 2,583 Less: Gain from notes payable principal reduction — — — (250 ) — Equity in net income of unconsolidated joint ventures (335 ) (306 ) (895 ) (8,004 ) (866 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,563 $ 4,961 $ 48,747 $ 47,302 $ 50,145 Total Revenue $ 123,231 $ 125,023 $ 749,374 $ 734,239 $ 751,166 Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage 2.9 % 4.0 % 6.5 % 6.4 % 6.7 % Interest incurred $ 6,716 $ 2,036 $ 26,658 $ 8,239 $ 21,978 Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total interest incurred 1.8 x 5.7 x 2.3\nx\nTotal debt at period end $ 319,029 $ 241,738 $ 318,656 Ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA 6.5 x 5.1 x 6.4 x Total net debt at period end $ 227,407 $ 131,416 $ 194,686 Ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n4.7 x 2.8 x 3.9 x Total cash, inventory, and joint venture investments $ 608,323 $ 486,311 $ 595,513 Ratio of cash, inventory, and joint venture investments to debt 1.9\nx\n2.0 x 1.9\nx\n(1) \"LTM\" indicates amounts for the trailing 12 months. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s ratio of debt-to-capital to the non-GAAP ratio of net debt-to-capital. We believe that the ratio of net debt-to-capital is a relevant financial measure for management and investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of the Company’s ability to obtain financing.\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Total debt, net $ 319,029 $ 318,656 Equity, exclusive of non-controlling interest 259,873 263,990 Total capital $ 578,902 $ 582,646 Ratio of debt-to-capital (1) 55.1 % 54.7 % Total debt, net $ 319,029 $ 318,656 Less: cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 91,622 123,970 Net debt 227,407 194,686 Equity, exclusive of non-controlling interest 259,873 263,990 Total capital $ 487,280 $ 458,676 Ratio of net debt-to-capital (2) 46.7 % 42.4 % (1) The ratio of debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing total debt, net by total capital (the sum of total debt, net plus equity), exclusive of non-controlling interest. (2) The ratio of net debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is total debt, net less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash to the extent necessary to reduce the debt balance to zero) by total capital, exclusive of non-controlling interest. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt-to-capital. We believe the ratio of net debt-to-capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. We believe that by deducting our cash from our debt, we provide a measure of our indebtedness that takes into account our cash liquidity. We believe this provides useful information as the ratio of debt-to-capital does not take into account our liquidity and we believe that the ratio net of cash provides supplemental information by which our financial position may be considered. Investors may also find this to be helpful when comparing our leverage to the leverage of our competitors that present similar information.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005473/en/\nThe New Home Company Inc.\nInvestor Relations\nDrew Mackintosh, 949-382-7838\ninvestorrelations@nwhm.com\nSource: The New Home Company Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.NWHM.com&esheet=51800358&newsitemid=20180503005473&lan=en-US&anchor=www.NWHM.com&index=2&md5=3e3a648bcb6180f384761b29055b0ad3", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005473/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.NWHM.com&esheet=51800358&newsitemid=20180503005473&lan=en-US&anchor=www.NWHM.com&index=1&md5=5e56c24d9885b85f3e3db95b1c6b9fae"], "published": "2018-05-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T19:27:24.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
