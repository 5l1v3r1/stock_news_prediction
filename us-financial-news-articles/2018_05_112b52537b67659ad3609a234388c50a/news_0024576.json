REUTERS/Toby Melville\nAlmost 40 percent of children aged 10 and 11 in London are overweight or obese, according to research compiled for Britain’s parliament.\n“Child obesity in London is a ticking timebomb and I am determined to act. If we don’t take bold steps against it we are not doing right by our young people as well as placing a huge strain on our already pressurised health service,” Kahn said in a statement.\nThe ban will target food retailers with products deemed high in fat, salt or sugar such as McDonald’s.\nMcDonald’s has long been fighting perceptions that it encourages children to eat unhealthily. In 2011, it won a U.S. lawsuit allowing it to continue including toys in Happy Meals.\nCoca Cola and Pepsi - as part of the American Beverage Association - faced scrutiny during the same year following a U.S. campaign to bring awareness to the potential health concerns associated with sugar sweetened drinks.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\nFood and drink advertising contributed around 20 million pounds ($27 million) to Transport for London’s revenue during the 2016-17 financial year.\nA spokesperson from the mayor’s office said :”About two thirds of this comes from high fat, salt and sugar, food and drink.”\nThe National Centre for Social Research and Cancer Research UK found advertising of unhealthy foods – particularly when aimed at children – creates extra pressure on children and families when it comes to choosing what to eat and drink.\n“I want to reduce the influence and pressure that can be put on children and families to make unhealthy choices,” Kahn said. “I’m determined to do all I can to tackle this issue with the powers I have and help Londoners make healthy food choices for themselves and their children.” A train passes an advertisement for a food delivery company at Green Park underground station in London, Britain, May 11, 2018.
