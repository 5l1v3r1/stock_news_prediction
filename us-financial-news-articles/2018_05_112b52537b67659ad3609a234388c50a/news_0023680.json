The coalition will still be in a minority, with 93 of 200 lower house seats, and require ad hoc backing from the small Communist party.\nMost parties, and also some prominent Social Democrats, have rejected joining a cabinet led by the billionaire businessman because he has been charged with fraudulently tapping a European Union subsidy a decade ago. He calls the investigation a plot.\nAs a condition of forming a coalition, the Social Democrats secured an agreement that Babis will step down if a court finds him guilty in the fraud case.\nANO’s other concessions to the Social Democrats include raising sick pay and child allowances and increasing salaries across the education sector by 50 percent by 2021.\nCOMMUNIST BACKING “I think Social Democrat members will respond positively ... we made an awful lot of compromises,” Babis said.\nIf the deal falls through, he said an early election could be held next spring.\nThe pro-Russia and anti-NATO Communist party has said it would lend the government its 15 votes in the formal confidence vote, which would mark its first involvement in national government since the end of Communist rule in 1989.\nThe Communists oppose some of the potential coalition’s foreign policy plans, such as more involvement in NATO military missions, but their voice will be limited.\nOn defense, the new government would plan to boost spending to 1.4 percent of GDP from 1.05 percent last year, still far below the NATO guideline of 2 percent.\nIt would also look to stabilize debt, which has dropped thanks to strong economic growth in the past three years to 34.6 percent of GDP in 2017.\nTaxes should dip with a reduction in personal income tax and in value-added tax on some services, tap water and draught beer. The budget should remain broadly balanced.\nANO’s current one-party cabinet lost a vote of confidence in January and has since served in a caretaker capacity.\nEditing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T02:47:04.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
