Gramercy’s total liabilities, as of March 31, were $3.14 billion.\nGramercy’s shareholders will receive a second-quarter dividend of 37.5 cents per share.\nThe deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, Gramercy said.\nMorgan Stanley was Gramercy’s financial adviser, while Citigroup and BofA Merrill Lynch advised Blackstone.
