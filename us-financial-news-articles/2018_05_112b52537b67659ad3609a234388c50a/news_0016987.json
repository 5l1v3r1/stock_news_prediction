[nL1N1R51ZA]\nBut the spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1 does not address Houston’s 10 percent to 15 percent share of $2.5 billion in hurricane recovery costs, more than $600 million in deferred maintenance needs, or upcoming contract negotiations with city worker unions, according to Turner.\nAlso not in the budget is a plan for dealing with the cost of city workers’ post-retirement healthcare benefits. Turner said he will unveil over the next year a plan to begin paying down the $2.1 billion unfunded liability that accrued over the last decade or so.\nHouston took on its $8.2 billion unfunded pension liability through a Texas law enacted last year that put into place a 30-year cost-saving plan, which included the city’s issuance in December of $1 billion of taxable pension bonds.\nTurner said while the bonds added $42 million in debt service payments to the upcoming budget, the city’s fiscal 2019 pension contribution is about $300 million less than it would have been without the plan. In January, S&P Global Ratings revised the outlook on Houston’s AA credit rating to stable from negative, citing the pension changes.\nThe proposed budget projects ending fiscal 2019 with a nearly $191 million general fund balance, according to budget documents.
