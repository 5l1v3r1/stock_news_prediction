The three banks declined to comment.\nThe float will add to a busy pipeline of Chinese tech companies that are seeking to go public this year, including smartphone maker Xiaomi ( IPO-XMGP.HK ) and on-demand online services provider Meituan Dianping.\nMost of the biggest deals are expected to take place in Hong Kong under new rules in the city designed to attract more tech and biotech IPOs, as competition for new floats heats up between Hong Kong, New York and the Chinese mainland.\nBut one of the sources said Meili still favors a U.S. listing as the company, which is not yet profitable, believes U.S. investors will be more familiar with its e-commerce business model, as e-commerce giants such as Amazon ( AMZN.O ), Alibaba ( BABA.N ) and JD.Com ( JD.O ) are all listed there.\nMeilishuo, which means “beauty talk” in Chinese, and Mogujie, or “Mushroom Street”, both started out as online marketplaces and social sites targeting female consumers, highlighting and promoting items such as clothes, shoes, skincare products and handbags.\nThey evolved into shopping sites similar to Alibaba’s Taobao and merged in January 2016 to create a fashion services group including a platform for internet celebrities and models, and its own fashion brand.\nFounded in 2009, Meilishuo’s backers include Tencent Holdings Ltd, GGV Capital and Sequoia Capital China.\nMogujie, established two years later by a former Alibaba executive, counts Ping An Ventures, a venture capital arm of Chinese insurer Ping An Insurance Co., Hillhouse Capital and Hopu Investment Management as investors.\nReporting by Kane Wu and Julie Zhu, and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T06:42:51.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
