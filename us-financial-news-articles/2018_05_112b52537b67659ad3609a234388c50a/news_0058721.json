I’m very comfortable here. With these players it’s impossible not to win.”\nThousands of supporters turned out to greet Zinedine Zidane’s history-making side, who began their celebrations with a service at the Almudena cathedral before visiting the city chambers and later the city hall, addressing gathered fans in the Plaza del Sol.\n“Fortunately, this is turning into a routine for us,” said Real captain Sergio Ramos of his team, who became the first side since Bayern Munich in 1976 to win the competition three years in a row.\n“The team received support when we needed it the most and this also belongs to you. Now we have to think about winning number 14, because that’s what this club obliges us to do.” Slideshow (6 Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T07:05:15.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
