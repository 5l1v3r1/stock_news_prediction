On Thursday, IMF Director Christine Lagarde said she instructed her team to continue discussions regarding a fund-supported program for Argentina following an extremely rocky few weeks for the peso. Since March, the peso has slid over 10 percent. In May alone, the currency has registered intraday slides of over 5 percent and gains of over 2 percent. The Argentine government has hiked the benchmark interest rate some 1,275 basis points in recent weeks and announced it would seek a so-called \"high access stand-by\" agreement from the IMF to stabilize the country's economy. While rhetoric has been sanguine, there are no concrete commitments as of yet. The Argentine central bank intervened in the spot market for the second consecutive day on Friday, but that did not stop the peso's slide. The currency was trading down 4.18 percent in afternoon trade. Investors \"are continuing to unwind their positions (in peso-denominated assets) to dollarize (their portfolios),\" said a Buenos Aires-based trader. \"The central back had to sell dollars once again, but they were absorbed by the market immediately and the exchange rate didn't fall.\" Across Latin America, some other major markets saw their currencies weaken over 1 percent as well. In Brazil, the real currency was trading down 1.31 percent against the dollar. Traders said they were adopting defensive positions ahead of a new presidential election poll. \"Markets are hoping for a candidate with a reformist vision rising in the polls, which hasn't happened yet,\" wrote brokerage Advanced Corretora in a report. In Mexico, the peso fell 1.02 percent after Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the nation would not be rushed into a poor North American Free Trade Agreement deal and that plenty of issues with the negotiations were outstanding.
