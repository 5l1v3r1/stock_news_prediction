Some also turn to prostitution to make ends meet.\nJust days before Pakistan’s parliament passed the new bill, a transgender woman was murdered in the northern city of Peshawar, the fourth such killing this year according to local rights activists.\nThe law requires the government to set up dedicated safe spaces with medical and educational facilities where they would be free from harassment.\nOne clause specifically protects the community from harassment, which Butt said was still widespread, both in public and in private.\n“It provides a sense of being protected,” she said, describing how she and the rest of the community faced taunts and even physical attacks.\nIt will also allow transgender people to apply for driving licenses and passports and inherit property using their chosen identities, and to change their gender in official records.\nFor Rana, the most significant aspect of the changes is the ability for transgender men and women to register under their own identity, rather than one imposed by society.\n“The biggest source of happiness for us is that the new law provides transgender people the right to register their chosen gender identity on their government issued national identity cards and documents,” she said.\n“Now we can fight confidently at all levels, including in the courts, for these rights,” she added, calling the law “long overdue”.\nReporting by Saleem Shaikh and Sughra Tunio, Editing by Claire Cozens.
