A logo of Huawei is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/Files\nAs of April 25, the Pentagon ordered that these and related products be removed from its stores worldwide, according to Pentagon spokesman Major Dave Eastburn.\n“These devices may pose an unacceptable risk to the department’s personnel, and mission,” Eastburn said.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/Illustration/Files\nThe action followed a series of U.S. moves aimed at stopping or reducing access by Huawei and ZTE to the U.S. economy amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans.\nRepresentative of Huawei and ZTE could not be reached immediately for comment, though both have denied allegations that their products are used to spy.\nThe Pentagon noted in its comments to Reuters that in February 2018, the Director of National Intelligence, the heads of the FBI, CIA, and National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and National Glossarial Intelligence Agency testified before the U.S. Senate that Huawei products pose a potential security risk to users.
