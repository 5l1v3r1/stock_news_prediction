The numbers keep increasing and we’re not seeing the kind of responses that would be needed to prevent and reduce internal displacement,” she said.\nDemocratic Republic of Congo was the worst-hit country in Africa, with almost 2.2 million people forced from home last year, said the IDMC.\nSouth Sudan, Ethiopia and Central African Republic followed, together accounting for 2.1 million.\nInternally displaced people (IDPs) remain under the protection of their government even when it is the cause of displacement.\nThey often move to areas where it is difficult to deliver aid, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR).\nPeople who flee conflict usually remain in their countries and only cross borders if they still feel threatened, said Rishi Ramrakha, head of logistics in Africa for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).\nAid agencies must strike a balance between helping internally displaced people, refugees and host communities, he said, as resentment over newcomers receiving assistance can fuel conflict.\nIn addition to the 5.5 million who fled conflict, 2.6 million people were forced from their homes because of storms and floods in sub-Saharan Africa in 2017, said IDMC.\nUNHCR has not yet released data on the number of people who fled across borders in 2017, but said that in 2016 there was an increase of 16 percent on the continent.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Claire Cozens.
