AAPL, +1.35% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.02% are preparing to launch a new joint credit card, a move that would deepen the technology giant’s push into its customers’ wallets and mark the Wall Street firm’s first foray into plastic.\nThe planned card would carry the Apple Pay brand and could launch early next year, people familiar with the matter said.
