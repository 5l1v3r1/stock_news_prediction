Android P has an app dashboard that will show users how much time they spend inside each app. It will also let Android users set time limits for apps, which means users won't be able to access them after they've used them for a predetermined time during the day. Android P will introduce a \"Do Not Disturb\" mode that silences all notifications and a \"Wind Down\" function that turns the phone grayscale at a predetermined time so that people can prepare to go to sleep at night.\nApple typically announces the new version of its operating system during its developer conference and then rolls it out to consumers in the fall. Apple was not immediately available to comment.
