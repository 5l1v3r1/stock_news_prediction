Here’s essential reading on today’s developments.\nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY\nTwo anti-establishment parties poised to take power in Italy have finalised a coalition agreement that challenges the constraints of the euro. That sets up a possible fight with European leaders who only recently steered the common currency through a deep crisis.\nTwo cryptocurrency firms have talked to US regulators about the possibility of obtaining banking licences, a move that would allow startups to broaden the products they offer. The notion is relatively new in the crypto space, which has drawn scrutiny from US officials for allowing rapid growth in transactions outside the regulated financial system.\nWhen Argentina issued a 100-year bond it was taken by many as a case of market froth. Investors could hardly get more enthusiastic about emerging markets than lending for a century to a country that averaged a default every 25 years, James Mackintosh writes. So with Argentina now asking for a rescue from the IMF, were the sceptics were right? Not so much.\nThe former Russian spy poisoned in the UK more than two months ago has been released from hospital. Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were exposed to a nerve agent in March. The UK blamed Moscow. The hospital said Skripal’s recovery would continue elsewhere.\nPayPal has long been the king of peer-to-peer payments and a big player in online payments, but has had a very limited presence in stores, writes Paul J Davies for Heard on the Street.

Heavy losses accumulated earlier in the week among shares of utilities and real-estate companies were also set to drag the three main US indexes for the week.\nAmong the political risks were new government proposals in Europe, doubts over the US/North Korea summit in June and trade talks with China. A rally in oil and rising bond yields stoked bets on rising inflation, which could pressure earnings.\nIn Europe, stocks closed down on the day but notched moderate gains for the week. The exception: Italy, where shares continued to struggle as investors weighed the country’s political risk. Italian banks bore the brunt of losses: Unione de Banchi Italiane fell 7.8% while UniCredit shed 2.7%. The euro was a little lower against the dollar.\nIn London, Paddy Power Betfair led the index higher, gaining 2.3%.
