(HTS) today announced that Information Technology (IT) Managing Director David Rhodes has been named the firm’s new Chief Information Officer (CIO). Rhodes will direct all of the firm’s IT efforts including End User Support, Systems Administration, Web and Application Development, IT Security and IT Services. He will report to HTS Chief Administrative Officer John R. Muschalek.\n“Rapid technological change is the new norm in our industry, and it impacts every corner of our firm—customer service, human resources, compliance, operations, marketing and legal,” said HilltopSecurities Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hill A. Feinberg. “Broker-dealers need IT leaders who can address the needs of clients accustomed to a service-now culture, while sustaining a modern, secure infrastructure that can attract and retain talent. We’re proud to say we’ve found that in David and we’re excited to have him directing our firm’s IT efforts.”\nRhodes joined HTS (then FirstSouthwest) in 2011, serving as Senior Vice President, Director of Application Development. As a Director, he led the rewrite of the firm’s web-based investment portfolio accounting, pricing and analytical software, which is used by a number of the firm’s bank clients. In 2017, his dedication to modernizing the firm’s infrastructure resulted in his promotion to IT Managing Director. Prior to joining HTS, Rhodes served in various supervisory roles with Caris Life Sciences, the McKesson Corporation and Capital Institution Services, Inc.\n“Information technology in financial services is an ongoing challenge. Fintech, robo advisors, e-trading and blockchain are continuing to disrupt the traditional broker-dealer business model, spurring a great need for firms to innovate while overcoming legacy infrastructure,” Rhodes said. “These are challenges that all firms face and HilltopSecurities is no different. I look forward to advancing the firm’s technological capabilities and integrating innovative systems that streamline operations, meet regulatory guidelines and create a positive experience for our clients.”\nRhodes is replacing HTS’ previous CIO, Jeff Hammill, who, for the past 12 years, led the firm’s IT department through various acquisitions and its 2016 merger. Hammill will continue to work on special projects for HTS until retiring at the end of 2018.\nAbout Hilltop Securities Inc.\nHilltop Securities Inc., a member of NYSE, FINRA and SIPC, delivers forthright advice and tailored solutions for municipal issuers, institutions, broker-dealers and individuals.
