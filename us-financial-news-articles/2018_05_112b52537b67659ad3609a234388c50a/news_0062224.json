When asked about an appeal, a Mizrahi spokesman said the bank would think about it and then decide.\nThe Bank of Israel, the country’s banking regulator, has been a longstanding supporter of the proposed deal.\nSupervisor of Banks Hedva Ber told reporters on Wednesday the merger would not hurt competition but would help it by enabling a mid-sized bank to compete more effectively with Israel’s two largest lenders — Hapoalim and Leumi .\nThese two together hold a 56 percent share of the bank credit supply market. The remaining 44 percent is held by the next three banks.\n“Our banking understanding is that it was possible to approve the merger,” Ber said.\nDespite the central bank’s backing, the deal faced heavy opposition from Israel’s finance and economy ministers as well as several other politicians. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon in 2015 had run on a platform of reforming Israel’s banks and lowering the cost of credit.\nThe head of Israel’s parliamentary finance committee last November had warned the Bank of Israel that it could be stripped of its banking supervisory role over its support of the merger.\nMizrahi criticised the anti-trust authority’s decision, saying it was unreasonable, based on unfounded arguments and completely ignored the central bank’s expertise in banking competition.\n“The imaginary competitive fears held on to by the anti-trust authority are baseless,” it said in a statement. “The merger not only would have not have harmed competition but would have dramatically benefited the consumer.”\nUnion’s shares closed down 2.5 percent, while Mizrahi’s were flat.
