If you're in an East Coast state like Maryland, you might get more bang for your buck . If you're west of the Mississippi River, on the other hand, you could find it more difficult to turn a real profit since properties there tend to stay on the market for longer.\nTo find the best and worst states for flipping a house, GOBankingRates analyzed data from real-estate site Zillow and property-data warehouse ATTOM in four key categories: median house listing price , the average number of days it takes to flip a house, average gross profit on flipping and average gross return on investment.\nIn the best states , the average time it takes to flip a house is 180 days, and in the worst states, it's 203 days. Each additional day can matter to your bottom line, since \"if you're borrowing money to buy each house you flip,\" the study notes, \"that's 23 more days of interest you have to pay on potentially a few hundred thousand dollars.\"\nHere are the top 10 worst places to flip a house, according to GBR's findings:\n1. Mississippi Average house listing price: $195,390\nAverage time to flip: 220 days\nAverage profit: $9,875\nAverage ROI: 4.3 percent\n2.

Missouri Average house listing price: $204,506\nAverage time to flip: 179 days\nAverage profit: $36,475\nAverage ROI: 47.3 percent\nHigher home listing prices can hurt a state's ranking, since they mean you may have to tie up additional capital in buying and renovating the property. In Hawaii, for example, the average listing price is almost $1 million, making it the second-worst place to flip a home.\nStates with longer average flip times also rank lower. That's likely because \"the sooner you can get your money out of one flip, the sooner you can reinvest it in another house,\" says GOBankingRates.\nshow chapters Master flipper reveals 3 common mistakes to a woman $3.5M in the hole 8:59 AM ET Wed, 1 March 2017 | 01:36 Jeremy Brandt, chief executive officer of WeBuyHouses.com, offers a word of caution: He tells CNBC Make It that many factors can alter you how much net profit you actually make on a flip. You might run into additional expenses if the house you're flipping needs significant repairs, for example.\nThere are also fees, like marketing, that can cut into profit: \"Most investors that are legitimate, large and experienced are running television commercials, sending out direct mail [and] putting up billboards. That is generally a few thousand dollars or more per property.\"\nYou also have to consider \"the holding cost of the house,\" Brandt says, which is longer in some markets than in others. \"If it takes a month or two to turn a house around, there are property taxes, there might be [homeowners' association] fees , there's insurance. If they have a loan on the property, there's interest on the loan . There's a lot of fees involved in just holding the property. You have to keep the lawn mowed. You have to keep the pool clean, that type of thing.\"\nYou may also need to pay a real-estate agent to sell the property when it's ready. \"So, you kind of run through all of those expenses,\" Brandt says, and \"it really adds up quite a bit.\"\nIf you're looking to flip a home, your profit will ultimately depend on your individual circumstances, so it's best to do y our research first before trying to make money on turning around real estate.
