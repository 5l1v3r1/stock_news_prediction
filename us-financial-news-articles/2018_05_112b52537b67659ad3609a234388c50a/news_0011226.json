The companies did the usual dance : Groceries would be cheaper, stores would stay open, employees would keep their jobs.\nTweet\nThen Mike Coupe, the chief executive of J Sainsbury, began to sing.\nWaiting to be interviewed for the British channel ITV News, Mr. Coupe, presumably unaware that the cameras were rolling, undercut the official line with an impromptu performance.\n\"We're in the money,\" he crooned. \"The sky is sunny. Let's lend it, spend it, send it rolling along.\"\nIntoning lines from a piece called \"The Gold Diggers' Song (We're in the Money)\" was probably not the best way to assuage concerns that shareholders might be making hay on the back of higher prices and job cuts. The song was first written for a 1933 film , but is perhaps most famously used in the musical \"42nd Street.\"\nThe reaction on Twitter was predictably acerbic.\nTweet\nTweet\nMr. Coupe quick ly apologized . \"This was an unguarded moment trying to compose myself before a TV interview,\" he said. \"It was an unfortunate choice of song, from the musical '42nd Street' which I saw last year, and I apologize if I have offended anyone.\"\nTweet\nSome found it harder to see the lighter side. The GMB union, which represents workers in the retail sector, expressed indignation.\n\"What on earth will Asda workers who are worrying about their futures think when they see this?\" the union said in a statement on Twitter. \"It's not only crass, it's completely unprofessional and utterly insensitive.\"\nMore from the New York Times:\nWhite House delays tariffs on E.U., Canada and Mexico for 30 days\nFacebook's privacy changes leave developers steaming\nGig economy business model dealt a blow in California ruling", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SainsburysNews/status/990858003233607681", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/business/dealbook/sainsbury-asda-merger.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/business/economy/gig-economy-ruling.html?ribbon-ad-idx=4&rref=business", "https://twitter.com/AnnielizzieSten/status/991023518832889856", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024069", "http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/2018-04-30/itv-news-exclusive-sainsburys-ceo-sings-were-in-the-money-before-asda-merger-interview/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/technology/facebook-privacy-developers.html?ribbon-ad-idx=4&rref=business", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/white-house-delays-tariffs-eu-canada-mexico.html?ribbon-ad-idx=4&rref=business", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43945254", "https://twitter.com/RichLeighPR/status/991088197491937280", "https://twitter.com/GarethBQuinn/status/991014012371505153"], "published": "2018-05-01T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T18:11:20.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
