Police, army and air force numbers were almost 40,000 below the authorized strength of 334,000, the report said.\nThe report showed the government controlled areas with about 65 percent of the population and controlled or influenced 56.3 percent of districts, the second lowest level since 2015, the first year after most international forces left Afghanistan.\nReporting by Jalil Rezaiee; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:50:41.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
