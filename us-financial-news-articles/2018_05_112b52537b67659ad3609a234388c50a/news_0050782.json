Soccer Football - FIFA World Cup - Germany Training - Eppan, Italy - May 23, 2018 Germany coach Joachim Loew arrives Markus Gilliar/Pool via Reuters\nThe Germans have lost just once in 23 games since their Euro 2016 semi-final defeat, cruising through the qualifiers with 10 wins in 10 matches and conceding just four goals in the process to advance to the World Cup.\nCoach Joachim Loew also had the luxury of being able to field a second-string team at last year’s Confederations Cup and still come away with the title, further adding to an already deep German bench.

Soccer Football - FIFA World Cup - Germany Training - Eppan, Italy - May 23, 2018 Germany coach Joachim Loew arrives Markus Gilliar/Pool via Reuters\nA core of 2014 World Cup winners, including Thomas Mueller, Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos and Mesut Oezil, will form the team’s experienced backbone.\nBut not everyone’s starting spot is guaranteed, with world-class players such as Leroy Sane, Timo Werner, Julian Draxler, Ilkay Guendogan, Mario Goetze and Marco Reus among those battling for their places.\nThere are still some question marks regarding the fitness of World Cup-winning keeper Manuel Neuer, who missed the season due to a foot injury and only recently returned to training. Soccer Football - Germany - Joachim Loew Press Conference - German Football Museum, Dortmund, Germany - May 15, 2018 Germany coach Joachim Loew during the press conference REUTERS/Leon Kuegeler\nLoew’s other options at keeper are just as strong, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Kevin Trapp and Bernd Leno waiting in the wings.\nJerome Boateng’s potential absence after picking up an adductor muscle injury late in the season could pose problems as he had formed a strong partnership with Hummels in central defence.\nAlready ruled out are Lars Stindl, last year’s joint top scorer at the Confederations Cup, who damaged his ankle in a league game in late April, and the injured Serge Gnabry.\nLoew should have no problem compensating for those absences with a wealth of talent waiting for their shot at what the Germany coach hopes will be their fifth world title to equal Brazil, who were also the last team to win back-to-back World Cups in 1958-62.
