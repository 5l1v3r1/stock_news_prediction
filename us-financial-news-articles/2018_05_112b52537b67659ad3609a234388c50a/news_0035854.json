He also declined to say who might be their choice of prime minister.\n“We agree we have to move quickly, but as we are writing what will be the government programme for the next five years, it’s very important for us to do it as well as possible, so we told the president we needed a few more days,” Di Maio said.\nThe president granted the request and, in a sign it might still take some time before a new government is installed, the League said it would hold an informal referendum of its voters on May 19 and 20 on any deal. 5-Star has also said it will put any accord to an online ballot of its members.\nThe two parties are looking to implement massive tax cuts, abolish unpopular pension reform and introduce new welfare payments to Italy’s growing army of poor.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo EU RULES\nBoth Di Maio and League leader Matteo Salvini have agreed to abandon their own ambitions to lead the government, but crossed vetoes appear to have scotched an array of other candidates.\nA 71-year-old university professor, Giulio Sapelli, was briefly in the spotlight on Monday, saying he had spoken to both leaders and was willing to do the job, but within minutes a 5-Star source denied he was their pick for the top office.\nAfter their separate meetings with Mattarella, Di Maio and Salvini denied that disagreements over who should be premier were to blame for the delay in reaching a coalition pact.\n“We’re not discussing names. I’m proud that we are discussing, even heatedly, about the kind of Italy we want to create,” said Salvini, adding there were differences on issues including immigration, justice reform and infrastructure.\nHe told reporters he also wanted the incoming government to stand up to European Union rules, which his party has repeatedly blamed for Italy’s anaemic economy.\n“Either I manage to create a government that renegotiates these external constraints or it’s a book of fairy tales and I don’t want to take anyone for a ride.” Slideshow (2 Images)\nThe economic promises made by both parties during the election campaign seem incompatible with Europe’s budget rules, though markets have so far seemed relatively unfazed at the prospect of the nascent coalition.\n5-Star emerged as the largest party after the March 4 vote, while the League was part of a centre-right bloc that won the most seats. The two agreed to seek a deal between themselves last week after all other options dried up.
