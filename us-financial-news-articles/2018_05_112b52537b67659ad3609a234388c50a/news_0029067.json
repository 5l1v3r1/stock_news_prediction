Thank you for accepting differences between us. Thank you for celebrating diversity!”\nShe won with a lively dance mix, singing “I’m Not Your Toy” that has a women’s empowerment twist, beating Cypriot entry Eleni Foureira with her fiery Latin pop song “Fuego”.\nCyprus and Israel had been the bookmakers’ favourites going into the 63rd edition of the Eurovision contest, which was hosted in the Portuguese capital Lisbon.
