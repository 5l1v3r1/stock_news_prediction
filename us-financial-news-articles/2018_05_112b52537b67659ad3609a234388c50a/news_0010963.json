However, they define the word differently, and experts say that could be an obstacle to a peace deal.\n“Denuclearization is a catch-all term that allows both sides to let it mean whatever they want it to mean,” said Vipin Narang, top nuclear expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It creates a lot of trouble as you approach a summit, because both sides can have very different definitions or notions of what it means,” said Mr. Narang.\nIn the video above, we explain where Washington and Pyongyang may differ on what “denuclearization” mean, and how they could bridge that gap.\nThe two Koreas have technically been at war for more than six decades.
