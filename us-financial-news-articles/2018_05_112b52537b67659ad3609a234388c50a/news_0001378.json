(“Bellatrix” or the “Company”) (TSX:BXE) (NYSE:BXE) today announces that it has entered into an exchange agreement with a holder (the \"Holder\") of its 8.50% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2020 (the “Senior Notes”) to exchange in a privately negotiated transaction, US$10 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes for 7,081,837 common shares of Bellatrix. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, the Senior Notes will be acquired at a 10% discount to their face value, and the common shares will be issued at a 5% discount to the volume weighted average price on the Toronto Stock Exchange for a 20 trading day period preceding April 30, 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions. The terms of the exchange agreement require the Company to qualify the common shares issuable in the exchange pursuant to a prospectus supplement to be filed by Bellatrix under the Company's existing base shelf prospectus. The Toronto Stock Exchange (the \"TSX\") has conditionally approved the listing of the common shares to be issued pursuant to the exchange on the TSX. In addition, application has been made to list the common shares to be issued pursuant to the exchange on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\"). Listing will be subject to the Company fulfilling all of the listing requirements of the TSX and the NYSE, as applicable. The transaction is expected to close on or before May 7, 2018.\nThe reduction of US$10 million of Senior Notes outstanding provides annualized interest savings of approximately $1.1 million using the current Canadian/US dollar exchange rate. The exchange agreement is consistent with Bellatrix’s strategy to improve financial strength, optimize its capital structure, and enhance long term shareholder value.\nThe Holder currently exercises control or direction over 517,430 Bellatrix common shares. In addition, the Holder currently exercises control or direction over $25,027,000 principal amount of convertible debentures of Bellatrix, which are convertible into 3,089,753 common shares based on a conversion price of $8.10 per common share. Following completion of the exchange, it is expected that the Holder will exercise control or direction over an aggregate of 7,599,267 common shares or 13.5% of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares and if the Holder was to elect to convert the convertible debentures held by the Holder, the Holder would exercise control or direction over an aggregate of 10,689,020 common shares or 17.9% of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares (assuming no other holder of the convertible debentures elected to convert their convertible debentures). Under the terms of the exchange agreement, and in an undertaking provided to the TSX, the Holder has agreed to not convert the convertible debentures it holds if it would result in the Holder beneficially holding greater than 19.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company.\nBellatrix Exploration Ltd. is a publicly traded Western Canadian based growth oriented oil and gas company engaged in the exploration for, and the acquisition, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves, with highly concentrated operations in west central Alberta, principally focused on profitable development of the Spirit River liquids rich natural gas play.\nFor further information, please contact:\nSteve Toth, CFA, Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Development (403) 750-1270\nBellatrix Exploration Ltd.\n1920, 800 – 5 th Avenue SW\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 3T6\nPhone: (403) 266-8670\nFax: (403) 264-8163\nwww.bxe.com\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: Certain information contained in this press release may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
