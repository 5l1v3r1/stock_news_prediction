Early detection of cancer can improve health outcomes, reduce the cost of care, and improve patients’ quality of life. Liquid biopsy diagnostic tests like those OncoCyte is developing may reduce the need for costlier and riskier diagnostic procedures such as invasive biopsy and cystoscopic procedures. OncoCyte’s development pipeline is focused on non-invasive confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung, breast, and bladder cancer. OncoCyte’s tests are being developed using proprietary sets of genetic and protein molecular markers that differentially express in specific types of cancer. OncoCyte conducts ongoing research to identify additional molecular markers, acquire or license markers and related technology, and develop tests based on those markers.\nContact\nEVC Group LLC\nMatt Haines / Michael Polyviou\n917-733-9297 / 732-933-2754\nmhaines@evcgroup.com / mpolyviou@evcgroup.com\nSource:OncoCyte Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aMKasFIbE2JAUM3_7rackTzoe_ZpU3N2fI9WIuHTrAzaA_M-se8o0toIya8qwYtjrEumCYIffELNsSxjZRBdsRgqAtCM1E-p1EsGe_aAqTd8JeihNo46DDDNRHmjDvtVdl5Fdtr1xD3qlOZfG_d6wbqkr_andmuwsCddFhIexicb8L-vDx3oCnPKjo-dWNRh", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8AMwcwJ49N1iUIVBjstupF8JQn4cLg1xRiutu3dApQ3PyU4HnL31v4B3D73QZ-i-GdkwX00c9UXNAI-WuxhKah2Sb9iNcDPVWN2wqMMnT1heA5dS7byVF0053eviRqiBj3hUToTPxSqgxeuvTSvA0MrNpCcX3RmfTt6nUwPmycjZ2WbztC-7pbxN2jHN2t5iWjIsqmI8zYrRn86oopgpfOx8-1xT9jdkXtjPz5ufU9t0l7WZ5TY-AOO1TiEIASIsYEVT8bhSMCWH7T7MJI3BCQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aMKasFIbE2JAUM3_7rackTzoe_ZpU3N2fI9WIuHTrAzaA_M-se8o0toIya8qwYtjrEumCYIffELNsSxjZRBdsYOIyKpyN0YJc790fQab4LzBO4ZXBbBa1lF_ziOUo336dg4xF2zkaMJWABZWYuRmzS4K9Lh9h0lYlZ0ZInAsapKE38PIZlecXm-6AvPSjMNV", "http://investors.oncocyte.com/events-and-presentations", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GG80J1dQrXaoF7CUMkVsNgMkSvRZJ8sik5Xw0EWDxALBQJzYBfIVeK2RhT41Z-3pZMkEbJ8X7aJkZ1Zrc58DbVYl9ASKAjaCezdmzNwTlBMEUMzALHmlT5VU14YSsGUtF8IRQZCmmrJ_hmvuEBJr7hT0ygH-YAmSUw7XOFKFa1vrZkga0zFCMY8oRVsCIaztwl1-p9s5v40yGLLXfdQoRg95jsxZ0aiptdoFxJ2og9cPsVbDyfzi2UJdab1M6m_43OuyHmhk1xOfJZMfWVXY9A==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WTpkUG9IxtQFedcDXicE96g4OLagW6wb9THTsZ9_QA-KMUYM8kjoYTDh968iZYzPFYLic4g8u3kb8lI6_LY2P1CYlwdrdtp9iPNdDsLaK5ngerFh5U3wlacAnN2UlR7TOoXvJ4uz9FCB8fVzs4T8fm3e7ZttwV19sJjdrxBAuTvGcRGUonUi0vQ6mGTuYnBVDI6TJ2VyZVlUIvkKMuMNq3mjtC3AnzATDZ7QYxfqhMk="], "published": "2018-05-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T17:01:33.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
