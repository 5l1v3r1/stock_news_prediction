Utilities output sank 4.3 percent compared with February, while mining dropped 1.5 percent and construction fell 0.7 percent. Among the various components, manufacturing was the only sector to advance, growing 2.1 percent in March. U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to leave the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have triggered uncertainty in Mexico, which sends mostly factory-made goods like televisions and cars to its northern neighbor. Mexico's industrial output is tightly linked to the U.S. economy, which receives about 80 percent of its exports. Compared with last year, Mexico's total output fell 3.7 percent.
