Other major players include Tigo Tanzania, a subsidiary of Sweden’s Millicom , and a local unit of India’s Bharti Airtel .\nFerrao said Vodacom plans to take part in Tanzania’s first spectrum auction expected to be held next month, aiming to acquire an additional 700 MHz of spectrum that would enable the mobile operator to roll out 4G services to more towns and cities in East Africa’s third-biggest economy.\n“Should we be successful in securing 700 MHz spectrum in this year’s auction, we expect to provide a superior 4G data user experience to a greater number of regions across the country,” he said.\nVodacom said active data customers rose by 882,000 over the past year to 7.3 million, driven by digital social media partnerships and low-cost smartphone campaigns.\nGoing forward, Ferrao said he expects Vodacom Tanzania’s revenue to continue to be underpinned by growth in mobile money and data services.\nVodacom’s $213 million initial public offering last August was Tanzania’s largest ever IPO, and attracted more than 40,000 local investors, most of whom were first-time participants in the country’s stock market.\nForeigners, initially banned from participating, bought 40 per cent of the shares.\nThe IPO was part of a government directive that mobile phone companies must float at least a 25 percent stake on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).\nVodacom is the only telecom company so far in Tanzania to list on the DSE.
