He was part of a trade that sent Gerrit Cole to Houston in the offseason. In his seven innings, Musgrove scattered five hits and needed just 67 pitches, 50 of them strikes.\nFor five-plus innings, it was a starters’ duel between 25-year-olds that each struck out seven and walked none.\nSt. Louis’ John Gant, looking for his first win since April 26, gave up three runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings.\nGant (1-2) sailed through five innings, giving up just two leadoff singles, before Pittsburgh chased him in the sixth.\nMusgrove opened with his first major league hit, a single to right. Harrison followed with a double to the gap in right-center, and Musgrove slid into home for a 1-0 lead. Harrison moved to third on Gregory Polanco’s groundout. Gant then hit Cervelli in the left shoulder, ending his night on the mound.\nAgainst Brett Cecil, Josh Bell brought home Harrison with a sacrifice fly, and Corey Dickerson tripled to right, scoring Bell to make it 3-0.\nIn the seventh, Austin Meadows started with a single and stole second. Jordy Mercer got an infield hit, moving Meadows to third. Two outs later, Polanco walked to load the bases, and Cervelli followed with a bases-clearing double off the wall in right to increase the lead to 6-0.\nSt. Louis’ Tommy Pham crushed a two-out homer to right-center, his ninth, in the eighth to spoil the shutout, 6-1.\nIn the Pittsburgh eighth, Meadows and Mercer hit back-to-back one-out triples for a 7-1 lead, and Harrison drove in Mercer with a single.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:24:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
