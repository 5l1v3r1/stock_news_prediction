DEINOVE therefore acquires the entire 2 share capital of the Austrian company Biovertis AG (\"BIOVERTIS\"), which itself owns the entire capital of the German company Morphochem AG für kombinatorische Chemie (\"MORPHOCHEM\"). The latter developed the antibiotic compound MCB3837, now in the clinical phase and targeting the treatment of severe gastrointestinal infections caused by Clostridium difficile, a pathogen classified as a priority by the WHO and the CDC 3 .\nIn consideration for this contribution in kind, the contributors, including two specialized investment funds managed by TVM Capital, which hold 82.98% of the rights contributed, received 500 001 DEINOVE shares to which are attached 8 000 000 warrants.\nThe shareholders also approved the appointment of TVM Capital GmbH, represented by Dr. Helmut Schühsler, as a new member of DEINOVE's Board of Directors (resolution 19).\nEmmanuel PETIOT, CEO of DEINOVE, stated: \"The acquisition of BIOVERTIS and MORPHOCHEM materializes the integration within our portfolio of the compound MCB3837, which consolidates our position in the antibiotic field. With this product, we have significantly expanded our portfolio of antibiotic compounds in development with a molecule already in the clinical phase and we intend to provide a response to the therapeutic deadlock that is severe infections with Clostridium difficile, causing several tens of thousands of deaths each year. This acquisition also allows DEINOVE to materialize the entry of a leading European venture capital player in the life sciences sector, TVM Capital, which will support DEINOVE in its next stages of development. We are very pleased that the shareholders have largely approved this structuring deal for DEINOVE.\"\nABOUT THE MCB3837 COMPOUND\nMorphochem's compound, MCB3837, targets the treatment of severe Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), gastrointestinal infections, and is ready to move on to Phase II.\n40% of patients have severe forms, with mortality rates as high as 50%. Over the past 20 years, Clostridium difficile infections have had a strong tendency to increase in incidence and severity, particularly due to the development of new, hyper virulent strains, some of which are resistant to existing antibiotics. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently identified CDI as one of the leading causes of healthcare-associated infections, even ahead of MRSA 4 . In 2011, about half a million Americans were infected and more than 29 000 patients died within 30 days 5 of diagnosis.\nThe treatment of CDI represents a real therapeutic challenge.\nTo date, no effective antibiotic treatment is available for severe gastrointestinal infections because of the very nature of the disease: oral treatments struggle to reach the intestine because of the pathological state of the patient (reduced gastrointestinal motility, intubation, intestinal perforation, etc.), while current intravenous (IV) antibiotics do not penetrate the gastrointestinal barrier and thus do not reach the infection site.\nMCB3837 is an antibiotic administered by intra-venous infusion and able to cross the gastrointestinal barrier. It precisely targets the infection site. Several Phase I trials (on a hundred healthy volunteers) have shown a high concentration of the antibiotic in stools, which is a strong marker of its presence in the intestine. It has demonstrated an ability to eliminate Clostridium difficile bacteria without destroying other microorganisms of the gastrointestinal flora. It has also shown an acceptable tolerance profile.\nThe next stage of development will be a Phase II clinical trial on a small number of patients. Green light has already been given by the FDA for the initiation of this study.\nFurthermore, in 2016, MCB3837 was granted the QIPD designation as well as Fast Track status from the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).\nABOUT TVM CAPITAL LIFE SCIENCE\nTVM Capital Life Science is a group of independent investment advisories and fund managers for Venture Capital funds, investing into innovative biotech, pharmaceutical, and medtech companies, with teams based in Munich and Montreal.
