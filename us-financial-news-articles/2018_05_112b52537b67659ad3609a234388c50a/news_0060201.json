The multifamily properties are undergoing significant renovations and will cater to residents looking to live near Bayside, the $1 billion master-planned, resort-style development along the shore of Lake Ray Hubbard. Once complete, Bayside will feature upscale restaurants, retail, beachfront recreational activities, office space, and Texas' first Crystal Lagoon, an eight-acre manmade pool with clear turquoise water.\nLed by Managing Director Alex Inman , Walker & Dunlop secured two bridge loans from a regional bank on behalf of the owner, Madera Residential. The financing will allow the owner to execute their business plan of repositioning both multifamily communities. Each three-year loan includes favorable terms, is partial interest-only, and is followed by a 30-year amortization.\n\"Having closed nearly 30 transactions with Walker & Dunlop already, it's no surprise they executed flawlessly on the transactions of both Landmark at Lake Village East & North.\" Commented Alton Smith at Madera Residential. \"Alex and his team were able to present several different financing options from various lending sources, allowing us to choose the best fit for our business plan.\"\nSaid Mr. Inman, \"Madera Residential is a highly skilled multifamily owner in the Dallas area and we are certain that their improvements will increase value for both the owner and residents.\" He added, \"We are pleased to be part of an exciting project in a growing area of Texas.\"\nBoth properties were constructed in 1983 and are undergoing a comprehensive upgrade program to renovate unit interiors, make exterior improvements, and increase offerings to residents. As part of their business plan, Madera Residential's use of the loan proceeds improving curb appeal and interiors will add significant value to the overall portfolio.\nLandmark at Lake Village North is an 848-unit, garden-style apartment community located near the intersection of Interstates 635 and 30 and close to the President George Bush Turnpike.
