The latest reading fell short of the 0.5 percent increase expected from a survey of Reuters analysts.\nThe metric posted significant gains in January and February.\nThe ratio of inventories to sales for merchant wholesalers was 1.26 in March, meaning it would take merchants 1.26 months to clear shelves of their inventories. It's a slight tick downward from the year-ago ratio of 1.28.\nThe monthly survey tracks merchants in various businesses, including exporters and industrial distributors.\nThis is a breaking news story.
