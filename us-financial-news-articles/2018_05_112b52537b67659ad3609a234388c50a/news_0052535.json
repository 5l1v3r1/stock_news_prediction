S&P 500 e-minis were up 5 points, or 0.18 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 26.5 points, or 0.38 percent.\nMicron, which raised its quarterly forecast and led the chipmakers higher on Monday, jumped 5.3 percent after announcing a $10 billion share buyback.\nFacebook edged up 0.3 percent ahead of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s defense of the company’s data practices to European lawmakers in Brussels. The testimony starts at 12:15 p.m. ET and comes three days before tough new European Union rules on data protection take effect.\nThe possibility of a ZTE reprieve boosted shares of optical component makers. Acacia Communications, which got 30 percent of its 2017 revenue from ZTE, rose 4.6 percent, while Oclaro gained 1.4 percent.
