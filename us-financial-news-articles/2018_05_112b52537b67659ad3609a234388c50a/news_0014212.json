The dividend will be paid on July 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 29, 2018.\nFor shareholders residing in the United States, the U.S. dollar equivalent will be determined based on the daily rate published by the Bank of Canada on June 29, 2018. This dividend is an \"eligible dividend\" as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada).\nSean Roosen, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Osisko, commented: “We are happy to declare our 15 th consecutive dividend payment. We are proud of our achievement having already returned a total to $62.9 million to shareholders since inception of the Company in 2014.”\nThe Company also wishes to remind its shareholders that it has implemented a dividend reinvestment plan (the “Plan”). Shareholders who are residents of Canada and the United States may elect to participate in the Plan in connection with the dividend to be paid on July 16, 2018 to shareholders on record as of June 29, 2018. If a shareholder elects to participate in the Plan, the Company will issue to the shareholder, in lieu of a cash dividend, common shares from treasury at a 3% discount to the weighted average price of the common shares during the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the dividend payment date. Participation in the Plan is optional and will not affect a shareholders’ cash dividends if the shareholder elects not to participate in the Plan. Quarterly dividends are only payable as and when declared by Osisko’s Board of Directors.\nA complete copy of the Plan and the enrolment form are available on Osisko’s website at http://osiskogr.com/en/dividends/drip/ . Shareholders should carefully read the complete text of the Plan before making any decisions regarding their participation in the Plan.\nNon-registered beneficial shareholders who wish to participate in the Plan should contact their financial advisor, broker, investment dealer, bank or other financial institution that holds their common shares to inquire about the applicable enrolment deadline and to request enrolment in the Plan. For more information on how to enroll or any other inquiries, contact the Agent at 1-800-387-0825 (toll-free in Canada) or inquiries@canstockta.com .\nParticipation in the Plan does not relieve shareholders of any liability for taxes that may be payable in respect of dividends that are reinvested in common shares under the Plan. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax implications of their participation in the Plan having regard to their particular circumstances.\nThis press release is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer of securities.\nAbout Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd\nOsisko Gold Royalties Ltd is an intermediate precious metal royalty company focused on the Americas that commenced activities in June 2014.
