Self evidently it is not a requirement for EU membership in practice,” Sturgeon said, speaking at an event hosted by the Politico news website in Brussels.\n“The pound is Scotland’s currency right now. The pound, as everybody knows, is a fully tradable international currency. There is absolutely nothing to stop Scotland from using the pound,” Sturgeon added.
