We anticipate completing this review by the fiscal year end and we are expecting additional state credits will be determined as well.\n\"And although our Research segment's revenue decreased 10% this quarter, as compared to last year, largely due to a delay in commercial revenue, RMD's commercial revenue shows signs of picking up this quarter, as evidenced by the recently announced new purchase orders from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Overall, our revenue for the quarter was up 2% over the same period last year.\"\nCertain key metrics by segment for the current quarter and the same quarter last year are presented below:\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nOptics\nContract\nResearch\nBiomedical\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 5,910,000\n$ 4,345,000\n$ -\n$ 10,255,000\nGross profit\n2,050,000\n1,895,000\n-\n3,945,000\nGM %\n35%\n44%\n-\n38%\nOperating expenses\n1,858,000\n1,813,000\n194,000\n3,865,000\nOperating income (loss)\n$ 192,000\n$ 82,000\n$ (194,000)\n$ 80,000\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nOptics\nContract\nResearch\nBiomedical\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 5,281,000\n$ 4,804,000\n$ -\n$ 10,085,000\nGross profit\n1,913,000\n1,875,000\n-\n3,788,000\nGM %\n36%\n39%\n-\n38%\nOperating expenses\n1,597,000\n1,802,000\n392,000\n3,791,000\nOperating income (loss)\n$ 316,000\n$ 73,000\n$ (392,000)\n$ (3,000)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders was approximately $1.3 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and ($0.1) million or ($0.00) per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
