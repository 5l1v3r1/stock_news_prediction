Our small molecule drug candidates are directed against an important family of enzymes called kinases, known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. We use our deep understanding of kinase biology together with a proprietary chemistry library to purposefully design compounds that maintain kinases in a “switched off” or inactivated conformation. These investigational therapies comprise tumor-targeted agents designed to address therapeutic resistance causing mutations and immuno-targeted agents designed to control the activation of immunokinases that suppress critical immune system regulators, such as macrophages. We have used our platform to develop a diverse pipeline of tumor-targeted and immuno-targeted drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer by improving the quality, rate and/or durability of their responses to treatment.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180529005176/en/\nMedia:\nThe Yates Network\nGina Nugent, 617-460-3579\ngina@theyatesnetwork.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nArgot Partners\nLaura Perry or Sam Martin, 212-600-1902\nLaura@argotpartners.com or Sam@argotpartners.com\nor\nCompany:\nDeciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC\nChristopher J.
