Loudermilk, GSE’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “GSE had a solid start to 2018, successfully delivering on our commitments to our customers and our shareholders. We efficiently executed on our backlog, resulting in year over year revenue growth of approximately 40% in the first quarter. We are growing our footprint as a provider of highly skilled professionals and know-how to the nuclear power industry with the recent addition of True North Consulting. Our strong balance sheet, along with our acquisition credit facility, positions us well to advance our strategy of leveraging GSE as an exciting platform for rolling-up fractured vendor ecosystems serving the nuclear power industry. We have identified and continue to work towards capitalizing on a number of exciting organic and inorganic growth opportunities. 2018 is off to a solid start, and we aim to build on our success to grow revenue and further enhance shareholder value.”\nQ1 2018 RESULTS\nQ1 2018 revenue increased 40.1% to $22.9 million, from $16.3 million in Q1 2017, primarily driven by the acquisition of Absolute Consulting, LLC (“Absolute”) in September 2017.\n(in thousands) Three months ended March 31, Revenue: 2018 2017 (unaudited) (unaudited) Performance Improvement Solutions\n$\n9,901\n$\n9,670\nNuclear Industry Training and Consulting 12,994 6,672 Total Contract Revenue $ 22,895 $ 16,342 Performance Improvement Solutions revenue totaled $9.9 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was mainly driven by an increase of $0.4 million due to more work performed for some major projects, which was partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million from international subsidiaries as a result of the Company's restructuring plan. We recorded total Performance Improvement Solutions orders of $5.9 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNuclear Industry Training and Consulting revenue increased 94.8% to $13.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Absolute, which contributed $7.4 million to the current period revenue. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million from Hyperspring due to lower staff augmentation needs from two major customers. Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting orders totaled $18.8 million with $9.7 million attributable to Absolute, and $14.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nQ1 2018 gross profit increased to $4.9 million, or 21.4% of revenue, from $4.1 million, or 25.2% of revenue, in Q1 2017.\n(in thousands) Three months ended March 31, Gross profit 2018 2017 (unaudited) (unaudited) Performance Improvement Solutions $ 3,251\n32.8% $ 3,044 31.5% Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting 1,647 12.7% 1,078 16.2% Consolidated Gross Profit $ 4,898 21.4% $ 4,122 25.2% Performance Improvement Solutions gross profit for Q1 2018 was $3.3 million, or 32.8% gross margin, compared to $3.0 million, or 31.5% gross margin, in Q1 2017. The year-over-year increase in gross margin for Performance Improvement Solutions for Q1 2018 was mainly due to increased software sales which generally have a higher gross margin percentage than other types of contracts. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's software sales accounted for 9% and 5% of the segment revenue, respectively.\nNuclear Industry Training and Consulting gross profit for Q1 2018 was $1.6 million, or 12.7% gross margin, compared to approximately $1.1 million, or 16.2% gross margin, in Q1 2017. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin during 2018 for Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting was primarily driven by lower margin from Absolute projects. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, Absolute contributed 57.1% of the segment revenue with a gross profit margin of 11.2%.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in Q1 2018 totaled $4.5 million, or 19.8% of revenue, compared to $3.6 million, or 22.0% of revenue, in Q1 2017. The year-over-year increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of Absolute, which contributed $0.5 million to Q1 2018 SG&A expenses, as well as higher bonus expense of $0.3 million mainly due to a new post earnout bonus plan in 2018 for certain Hyperspring employees and higher one-time professional fees of $0.3 million associated with the implementation of the new revenue standard and tax legislation. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in contingent consideration expense related to the 2014 Hyperspring acquisition as the earn-out period expired in November 2017.\nOn December 27, 2017, the Board of GSE Systems, Inc. approved an international restructuring plan to streamline and optimize the Company's global operations, and the Company announced a total restructuring charge of $1.8 million spread out over several quarters, excluding any tax impacts and cumulative translation adjustments. The Company recorded a charge of $0.7 million in Q4 2017. For Q1 2018, restructuring charges totaled $0.9 million, which included severance expense of $0.3 million, lease termination costs of $0.5 million and other costs of $0.1 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had recorded accumulated restructuring charges of $1.7 million, and expects to record the remaining restructuring charges of approximately $0.1 million by the end of Q2 2018. These restructuring charges exclude cumulative translation adjustment losses of approximately $1.4 million, assuming currency rates at March 31, 2018, and will be charged against net income upon liquidation of the respective foreign subsidiaries. The Company also expects to recognize tax benefits related to the liquidation of these subsidiaries that may offset the majority of the currency translation adjustment losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $45,000, which represented true-up adjustments related to the restructuring plan initiated in 2015.\nOperating loss was approximately $1.1 million and $57,000 in Q1 2018 and Q1 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by restructuring charges to streamline international operations.\nNet loss for Q1 2018 totaled approximately $1.5 million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share, compared to $0.3 million, or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share, in Q1 2017. The increase was primarily driven by restructuring charges to streamline international operations and higher tax provisions due to the accruals related to uncertain tax positions for certain foreign tax contingencies.\nAdjusted net income 1 , excluding the impact of gain/loss from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense and loss on derivative instruments, net, was approximately $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to approximately $0.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in Q1 2017.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for Q1 2018 was negative $0.9 million compared to $37,000 in Q1 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 , which excludes the impact of gain/loss from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense and loss on derivative instruments, net, totaled approximately $0.8 million and $1.1 million for Q1 2018 and Q1 2017, respectively.\nBACKLOG AND CASH POSITION\nBacklog at March 31, 2018, increased to $72.4 million from $71.4 million at December 31, 2017. Backlog at March 31, 2018, included $41.5 million of Performance Improvement Solutions backlog and $30.9 million of Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting backlog. True North had approximately $4.0 million of backlog as of March 31, 2018, which was not included in the Company's backlog at March 31, 2018.\nGSE’s cash position at March 31, 2018, was $12.4 million, including $0.6 million of restricted cash, as compared to $20.1 million, including $1.0 million of restricted cash, at December 31, 2017. The change in cash position was primarily driven by the timing difference of cash collection and payments in different periods. The Company expects its normalized cash position in the second half of 2018 to approximate $15.0 million after payments are received and costs related to restructuring costs are completed excluding any future acquisitions payments.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nManagement will host a conference call today at 4:30 pm Eastern Time to discuss Q1 2018 results as well as other matters.\nInterested parties may participate in the call by dialing:\n(877) 407-9753 (Domestic) (201) 493-6739 (International)\nThe conference call will also be accessible via the following link:\nhttp://www.investorcalendar.com/event/28203\nFor those who cannot listen to the live broadcast, an online webcast replay will be available at www.gses.com or through August 15, 2018 at the following link: http://www.investorcalendar.com/event/28203 .\nABOUT GSE SYSTEMS, INC .\nGSE Systems, Inc. is a leader in real-time high-fidelity simulation systems, training/consulting and technology-enabled engineering solutions to the power and process industries.

Management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to operating profit, net income and other GAAP measures, are useful to investors to evaluate the Company’s results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the Company’s core operating performance that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our results for any particular period. Investors should recognize that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC Regulation G is as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss\n$\n(1,496\n)\n$\n(266\n)\nInterest income, net (22 ) (27 ) Provision for income taxes 259 73 Depreciation and amortization 371 257 EBITDA (888 ) 37 Loss from the change in fair value of contingent consideration - 254 Restructuring charges 917 45 Stock-based compensation expense 627 596 Loss on derivative instruments, net 156 160 Adjusted EBITDA $ 812 $ 1,092 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS Reconciliation (in thousands, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted Net Income and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Management believes adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, in addition to other GAAP measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance. Our management uses Adjusted Net Income and other non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our business and make certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, planning, employee compensation and resource allocation). This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors can benefit by evaluating both non-GAAP and GAAP results. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted EPS to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, in accordance with SEC Regulation G is as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss\n$\n(1,496\n)\n$\n(266\n)\nLoss from the change in fair value of contingent consideration - 254 Restructuring charges 917 45 Stock-based compensation expense 627 596 Loss on derivative instruments, net 156 160 Adjusted net income $ 204 $ 789 Diluted loss per common share $ (0.08 ) $ (0.01 ) Adjusted earnings per common share – Diluted $ 0.01 $ 0.04 Weighted average shares outstanding - Diluted (a) 19,902,752 19,502,057 (a) During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company reported a GAAP net loss and positive adjusted net income. Accordingly, there were 388,367 and 407,675 dilutive shares from options and RSUs included in the adjusted earnings per common share calculation for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, that were considered anti-dilutive in determining the GAAP diluted loss per common share.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515006585/en/\nCompany\nGSE Systems, Inc.\nChris Sorrells, 410-970-7802\nChief Operating Officer\nor\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nKalle Ahl, CFA, 212-836-9614\nSenior Associate\nkahl@equityny.com\nSource: GSE Systems, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gses.com&esheet=51806872&newsitemid=20180515006585&lan=en-US&anchor=www.gses.com&index=2&md5=a76027d627bf20f26fe5ac223bfa784b", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gses.com&esheet=51806872&newsitemid=20180515006585&lan=en-US&anchor=www.gses.com&index=4&md5=52c8442ea7d81703ad7b0f08e061de1f", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515006585/en/", "http://www.investorcalendar.com/event/28203", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.investorcalendar.com%2Fevent%2F28203&esheet=51806872&newsitemid=20180515006585&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.investorcalendar.com%2Fevent%2F28203&index=3&md5=717939a8418706eb835a046483a08869", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.investorcalendar.com%2Fevent%2F28203&esheet=51806872&newsitemid=20180515006585&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.investorcalendar.com%2Fevent%2F28203&index=1&md5=635e8f21d04f0187e1beffa3498ab42d"], "published": "2018-05-16T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T02:20:34.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
