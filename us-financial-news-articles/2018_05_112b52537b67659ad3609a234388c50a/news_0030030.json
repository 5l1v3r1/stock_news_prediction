Newly elected Catalonia regional president, Quim Torra, is applauded by fellow party members and pro-indpendence parties following an investiture debate at the regional parliament in Barcelona, Spain, May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Albert Gea\nThe election of Quim Torra as regional leader will allow the wealthy region to run its own affairs for the first time since October, when Madrid imposed direct rule after sacking the previous administration after it declared independence.\nIt should also lead to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy securing the backing he needs from regional parties to implement much-delayed central government budget plans. But it is unlikely to ease tensions between Madrid and Barcelona.\nThe deeply-divided Catalan parliament voted 66 in favour, 65 against and 4 abstentions for the election of Torra, a former lawyer and publisher with little political experience. The simple majority was what he needed to be voted leader after failing to get an absolute majority in a ballot on Saturday.\nFollowing the vote, pro-independence lawmakers stood to sing the Catalan anthem. Torra, who was hand-picked as candidate by former regional leader Carles Puigdemont, then embraced members of parliament who formed a line to congratulate him.

REUTERS/Albert Gea\nMany wore yellow ribbons in honour of Catalan politicians held in custody in jail for their role in October’s illegal independence referendum.\nIn a speech to parliament on Saturday, Torra promised to work towards a Catalan republic and referred to Puigdemont, who is in Berlin waiting for a German court to rule on an extradition request from Spain, as the legitimate leader of the region.\nThe Spanish government called the speech confrontational and a member of the Catalan parliament for Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP), Andrea Levy, said on Monday in a television interview that Madrid would apply direct rule again if the new administration overstepped the law.

However, the party that won the most votes was Ciudadanos (“Citizens”), which favours unity with Spain.
