Kieny is the managing partner in the law firm of Riggs, Abney, Neal, Turpen, Orbison & Lewis in Denver and has been with the firm since 1997. She manages 30 lawyers and in addition handles a substantial traffic ticket case load, spearheading the delivery of LegalShield traffic law benefits for Colorado members. She is a preferred referral attorney for LegalShield regarding traffic matters and also assists members with Commercial Drivers Legal Plans. She recently led a presentation at the GLSA Conference in April concerning the importance of having a practice related to traffic tickets.\nKieny supervises more than 20 attorneys and staff members in day-to-day operations for LegalShield, and she serves as the main contact for members who call the firm’s emergency access line after hours. Sarah is also passionate about access to justice for all and using technology to remove the barriers to affordable legal services. She coordinates quarterly “Law Day” initiatives, bringing volunteer attorneys to local schools and community centers for an evening to meet with community members. Sarah is an active LegalShield ambassador at conferences and seminars across the country.\nBenjamin Farrow is a shareholder in The Anderson Law Firm in Montgomery, AL. His areas of practice include collections, business and commercial law, car accident, federal trial practice, mediation, personal injury and litigation. He is licensed in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi and maintains an active docket in all three states. Ben is the supervising attorney for LegalShield at his firm, and actively engages with company associates as well as other provider attorneys. He leads estate planning webinars for members and most recently moderated a presentation at the GLSA Conference about social media ethics for lawyers, “Legal Ethics: Implications and other issues for lawyers managing their own on-line brand.”\n“On behalf of LegalShield, we’re delighted to have two representatives on the GLSA board,” said Keri Norris, senior vice president of regulatory affairs and chief legal counsel. “Sarah and Ben are both excellent attorneys, and their success is outweighed only by their compassion and dedication to advancing access to justice for all. We are proud to work alongside all of the hard-working attorneys in our provider network of law firms in all 50 states and four provinces in Canada.”\nAbout GLSA\nGLSA is a Chicago-based nonprofit, ABA-affiliated membership association for those involved in the legal services plan industry, which delivers legal services to a broad range of clients. Members are committed to providing affordable access to legal services. The conference focuses on providing lawyers involved in the legal services plan industry with education, support and collaboration so that they may focus on the practice of law rather than the marketing of their law practices.\nAbout LegalShield\nA pioneer in the democratization of affordable access to legal protection, LegalShield is one of North America’s leading providers of legal safeguards and protection against identity theft for individuals, families and small businesses.
