To complete the wedding theme, the cupcake is frosted to look like an English rose.\n“When we found out Harry and Meghan’s wedding cake flavour was lemon elderflower, we knew we had to do something special at Georgetown Cupcake to celebrate,” said Sophie LaMontagne, who owns the bustling shop with her sister, Katherine Berman.\nCustomers at the store in Washington’s tony Georgetown neighbourhood approved when treated to samples of the mix of lemon and elderflower, which comes from the European elderberry.\n“It seems like them, right?” said Georgina Argamonte, referring to the royal couple.\n“Yeah, because it’s a little bit of lemon and vanilla and so it’s a little bit of sweet and tart. So, I think that mixes with their personality,” said Argamonte, a 51-year-old from Puerto Rico who was visiting her two children studying in Washington. The Georgetown Cupcake bakery plans commemorative cupcakes they'll be selling in honor of the upcoming royal wedding between Britain's Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle, at her shop in Washington, U.S. May 4, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nHarry, the 33-year-old son of the late Princess Diana and Prince Charles, and Markle, 36, are set to be married at Windsor Castle before 600 invited guests amid intense global media attention.\nIn 2011, Georgetown Cupcake came up with special cakes for Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton. But the current cupcake array is distinctly Harry and Markle, with pearlized wedding sprinkles, fondant Union Jacks and “H&M” symbols.\nFor Toronto-raised LaMontagne, the royal wedding is personal. “We grew up in Canada. We were born and raised there,” she said as she frosted a cake.\n“And we grew up, you know, watching Princess Diana. We’ve always had a keen interest in the royal family every since we were little girls.” Slideshow (9 Images)\nThe cupcakes are not the only pastries with the wedding theme on sale. Decades-old slices of cake from British royal weddings - including those of Charles and Diana and of William and Middleton - go up for auction next month.
