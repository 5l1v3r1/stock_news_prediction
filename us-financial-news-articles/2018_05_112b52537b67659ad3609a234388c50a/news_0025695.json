The Central Bank said its headline profits will normalise over the medium term.\nAnnouncing the profit, central bank Governor Philip Lane said the ongoing economic recovery is expected to continue at Irish, European and global levels in the near term, supported by the European Central Bank’s accommodative monetary strategy.\nBut he cautioned that prudential management of macro-financial tail risks is also necessary.\n“Small, highly globalised countries like Ireland are more volatile than larger economies, which means we can grow strongly for extended periods but are especially vulnerable to negative shocks,” Lane said.\n“High stocks of both public and private debt and the inherent volatility of the Irish macro-financial system requires ongoing vigilance.” (Reporting by Graham Fahy; Editing by Catherine Evans)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:48:01.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
