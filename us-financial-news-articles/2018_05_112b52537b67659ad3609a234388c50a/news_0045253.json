Democrats opposed the legislation due to changes it would make to a food stamps program used by about 40 million Americans, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\nMembers of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry have said they are writing their own version of the farm bill because the Houseâ€™s proposed SNAP changes could not pass the chamber, where Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority and passing most legislation requires 60 votes.
