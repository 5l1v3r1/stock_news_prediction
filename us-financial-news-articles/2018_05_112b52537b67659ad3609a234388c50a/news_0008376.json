Ross said the White House has \"no intention of protracted extensions\" and wants to make a decision soon to curb alleged trade abuses.\n\"If we're going to impose it, we're going to have to do it pretty soon, or else people will start gaming the system,\" the Commerce secretary told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Tuesday.\nThe U.S. and EU have held \"potentially fruitful discussions,\" and Ross said he hopes the entities can potentially avoid tariffs. The Trump administration has already permanently exempted South Korea from tariffs because the country agreed to quotas under a new trade deal. It could also exempt countries such as Argentina , Australia and Brazil due to a separate agreement to address trade practices.\nTrump has contended international dumping of steel and aluminum has hurt American producers of the metals.
