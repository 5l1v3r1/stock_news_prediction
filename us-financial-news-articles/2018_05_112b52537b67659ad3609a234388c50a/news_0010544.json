REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\nU.S. border officials had allowed through only small groups at a time, saying the busy San Ysidro crossing to San Diego was saturated and the rest must be patient.\nThe migrants have spent four chilly night camped outside the port of entry.\nIn response to the caravan’s arrival at the U.S-Mexico border crossing, the U.S. Justice Department said it was sending 35 additional assistant U.S. attorneys and 18 immigration judges to the border.\nTrump wants to tighten laws to make it harder for people to claim asylum, citing a more than tenfold rise in asylum claims versus 2011.
