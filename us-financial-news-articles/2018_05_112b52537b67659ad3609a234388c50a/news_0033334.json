That compares with expected 2.8% year-ahead inflation and 2.9% for three years ahead in the March survey. The New York Fed noted those are the highest readings since early 2017. The rise was described as broad-based among the survey’s income and demographic groups.\nMeanwhile, on Thursday the Cleveland Fed reported that a model it uses to predict long-term inflation expectations is also moving higher. The bank said its latest estimate of the average inflation level expected over the next decade moved to 2.09% . That is up from 1.98% in April and is the highest reading in this series since January 2010. The bank’s estimate is derived from government data, surveys and market expectations.\nInflation expectations are important to the Fed. Central bankers believe where inflation is expected to go exerts a strong influence over where it is today.\nThe Fed has struggled to push low inflation up to its official 2% target for years. New signs of life on the expectations front may strengthen officials’ belief that rising price pressures seen in recent data are for real.\nThe Fed’s preferred price measure, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, hit 2% in March. But official Fed projections don’t see a sustained increase until next year, when policy makers on balance see inflation overshooting their target at 2.1% for the year.\nRecent vigor in inflation has driven some central bankers to say monetary policy could become more aggressive in the long term, especially considering strength in the job market along with tax cuts and government spending increases that could boost already robust economic activity.\n“In order to maintain our policy goals, we may need to move the fed-funds rate , for a time, a bit above the level of the funds rate that is expected to prevail over the longer run,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said in Paris on Monday.\nStill, not all central bankers are on board with this outlook, in part because a strong job market hasn’t led to robust wage growth. Meanwhile, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard bases part of his opposition to rate rises on the relatively low level of inflation expectations seen in financial markets.\nWhile Fed officials look at market expectations, many policy makers consider them to be too volatile to put at the center of their thinking about future inflation pressures.\nWrite to Michael S.
