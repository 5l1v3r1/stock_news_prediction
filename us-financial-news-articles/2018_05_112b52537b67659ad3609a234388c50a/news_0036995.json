Boone Logan entered and got David Peralta to ground out to second base before walking Chris Owings to bring up Descalso, who started as the No. 3 hitter in the lineup for the first time in his career.\nTravis Shaw drove in a run with one of three doubles for the Brewers, who had won four of five.\nDiamondbacks setup man Archie Bradley (1-1) pitched a 1-2-3 eighth inning, striking out two, and Brad Boxberger pitched around a one-out error in the ninth for his 12th save in 13 opportunities.\nArizona starter Zack Greinke gave up four hits and one run in six innings, with five strikeouts and one walk. Greinke has allowed three earned runs in his past 18 2/3 innings, dropping his ERA to 3.46, the lowest it has been since his first start.\nMilwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin gave up one run on two hits in seven innings, with seven strikeouts and two walks. He retired the last nine he faced after committing an error to open the fifth inning. Chacin has surrendered four runs in his last three starts covering 18 1/3 innings.\nThe Brewers took a 1-0 lead in the fourth inning on doubles by Christian Yelich and Shaw.\nArizona tied it at 1 in the bottom of the fourth. Descalso walked, took third on Paul Goldschmidt’s single and scored when Steven Souza Jr. grounded into a double play.\nBefore the game, the Diamondbacks placed A.J. Pollock on the 10-day disabled list with an avulsion fracture of his left wrist, sustained when he dived attempting to catch Tyler Saladino’s inside-the-park homer in the ninth inning of a 7-2 loss Monday. Pollock will miss between four and eight weeks, the team announced.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
