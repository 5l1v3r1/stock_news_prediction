Almarai is still considering both local and international currency denominations, CFO Paul Gay said.\nIts current five-year facility matures in September and is a local currency issue. Almarai is considering five, seven and ten years, and plans to keep the issue roughly the same size, he said on the sidelines of a business conference in Riyadh.\nGay declined to name the adviser hired for the issuance.\nThe company said in its 2017 annual report, released in April, that it was considering pursuing international financing options for the first time. Up until now it has relied exclusively on local Saudi banks and local sukuk issuances.\nInternational debt would provide the firm access to a wider pool of funding options, broaden its investor base, enhance financing costs and allow it to obtain a longer tenor, the report said.\nBanque Saudi Fransi, BNP Paribas, HSBC’s Saudi Arabian unit and Standard Chartered helped arrange the company’s previous issuance in 2013.
