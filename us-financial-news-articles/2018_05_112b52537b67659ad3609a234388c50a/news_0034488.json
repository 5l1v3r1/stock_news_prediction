Only the S&P financial sector was higher, by a marginal 0.02 percent, helped by higher yields.\nThe KBW bank index was up a stronger 0.55 percent.\nWhile consumer stocks overall were lower, shares of retailers including J. C. Penney, Target and Macy’s rose between 1.6 percent to 3.9 percent.\nHome Depot slipped 1.4 percent after the No.1 U.S. home improvement chain missed Wall Street forecasts for sales at established stores.\nSmaller rival Lowe’s was down 0.7 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.10-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.15-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 39 new lows.
