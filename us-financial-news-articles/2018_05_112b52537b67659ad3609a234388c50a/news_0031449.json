A presentation of the results by the Company's management will take place today at 10.00 am CET in Oslo – details below.\nRichard Godfrey, Chief Executive Officer of BerGenBio, commented: \"We are pleased with the progress made during Q1 2018. Patient recruitment into our global Phase II clinical proof-of-concept trials with bemcentinib is progressing well and we expect to deliver interim read-outs across all studies during 2018. Presentation of these results will be at major clinical congresses, including the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in June. Coinciding with ASCO, we will host a satellite event that will allow us to meet with our stakeholders and provide insights from KOLs and clinical experts on our selective AXL inhibitor bemcentinib as a potential cornerstone of cancer combination therapy. We believe that we will be able to demonstrate the significant potential of bemcentinib in cancer therapy by making tumour cells visible to the immune system and more susceptible to treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immuno-oncology drugs.\"\nHighlights - First Quarter 2018\nGood progress advancing bemcentinib's proof-of-concept clinical development First efficacy endpoint met in Phase II trial of bemcentinib/TARCEVA® (erlotinib) combination in advanced lung cancer (NSCLC) patients Recruitment completed in first stage of Phase II trial of bemcentinib in combination with KEYTRUDA® in advanced breast cancer (TBNC) patients Bemcentinib shown to be well tolerated in all patients enrolled across three combination trials with KEYTRUDA – data presented at ASCO-SITC 2018 Single agent therapy with bemcentinib led to increased immune activity in relapsed / refractory leukaemia (AML & MDS) patients – data presented at ASCO-SITC 2018\nPost period\nPrivate placement raising gross NOK 187.5 million from international institutional investors including from the USA, specialising in the biotechnology sector Recruitment completed in the first stage of Phase II trial of bemcentinib in combination with KEYTRUDA® in NSCLC patients Preclinical data highlighting bemcentinib's potential to reverse tumour immune suppression and enhance immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy, presented at AACR annual meeting Publications describe the role of AXL signalling in, and potential therapeutic effect of selective AXL inhibition to counteract the progression of aggressive fibrosis in lung and liver diseases\nFinancial Summary\n(NOK million)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nFY 2017\nOperating revenues\n-\n-\n-\nOperating expenses\n54.8\n65.8\n183.7\nOperating profit (loss)\n-54.8\n-65.8\n-183.7\nProfit (loss) after tax\n-53.8\n-65.1\n-182.2\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (NOK)\n-1.08\n-1.93\n-4.01\nNet cash flow in the period\n-41.1\n-66.4\n208.5\nCash position end of period\n329.2\n95.4\n370.3\nPresentation and Webcast Details\nA presentation by BerGenBio's senior management team will take place at 10.00 am CET at:\nFelix Konferansesenter, Bryggetorget 3, 0125 Oslo\nThe presentation will webcast live and the link will be available at www.bergenbio.com in the section Investors/ Financial Reports.

The Company is a world leader in understanding the essential role of AXL kinase in mediating aggressive disease, including immune evasive, drug resistant, metastatic solid and haematological cancers.\nBerGenBio's lead product, bemcentinib (BGB324), is a selective, potent and orally bio- available small molecule AXL inhibitor in four Company sponsored Phase II clinical trials in major cancer indications, with read-outs anticipated during 2018. It is the only selective AXL inhibitor in clinical development.\nThe Company sponsored clinical trials are:\nBemcentinib with TARCEVA® (erlotinib) in advanced EGFR mutation driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Bemcentinib with KEYTRUDA in advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung, and Bemcentinib with KEYTRUDA in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bemcentinib as a single agent and combination therapy in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) / myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS)\nThe clinical trials combining bemcentinib with KEYTRUDA in adenocarcinoma of the lung and TNBC are conducted in collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, NJ, USA), through a subsidiary.\nIn addition, a number of investigator-sponsored trials are underway, including a trial to investigate bemcentinib with either MEKINIST® (trametinib) plus TAFINLAR® (dabrafenib) or KEYTRUDA in advanced melanoma, as well as a trial combining bemcentinib with docetaxel in advanced NSCLC.\nBerGenBio is simultaneously developing a companion diagnostic test to identify patient subpopulations most likely to benefit from treatment with bemcentinib. This will facilitate more efficient registration trials and support a precision medicine based commercialization strategy.\nThe Company is also developing a diversified pre-clinical pipeline of drug candidates, including BGB149, an anti-AXL monoclonal antibody.\nFor further information, please visit: www.bergenbio.com\nKEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, TARCEVA® is a registered trademark of OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC., marketed by Roche-Genentech.
