SkyBridge and HNA Group announced in a press release Monday that the latter has decided to drop its bid due to ongoing delays. Scaramucci therefore will return to the business, focusing on strategic planning and marketing, according to Bloomberg .\nDespite dropping the deal, the two companies nevertheless plan to look into a partnership in which HNA could distribute SkyBridge’s products in China.", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-30/hna-skybridge-are-said-to-drop-deal-as-scaramucci-plans-return"], "published": "2018-05-01T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T14:45:34.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
