Eight cars parked on the street lined with shops were destroyed.\nBenghazi, Libya’s second-largest city, is controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA), the dominant force in eastern Libya led by commander Khalifa Haftar.\nThe LNA was battling Islamists, including some linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda, as well as other opponents until late last year in the Mediterranean port city.\nSecurity has improved since then, but two mosque bombings earlier this year killed at least 35 people.\nHaftar launched his military campaign in Benghazi in May 2014 in response to bombings and assassinations blamed on Islamist militants, part of anarchy that ensued after a NATO-backed uprising ended Muammar Gaddafi’s rule in 2011.\nIn the past few months, there have been occasional, smaller- scale bombings apparently targeting LNA allies or supporters, but attacks in the city center are rare\nSlideshow (5 Images) Reporting by Ayman al-Warfalli; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Sandra Maler and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T03:07:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
