We’re going to put them on this bus, and send them home,” Williams says in a campaign video .\nThe bus is painted gray, and large letters on the back read, “DANGER! Murderers, rapists, kidnappers, child molesters, and other criminals on board.” Just above the bumper it says, “Follow me to Mexico.”\nThis isn’t the first time Williams employed Trumpian methods. Last fall, he launched a bump stock giveaway right after the gunman in Las Vegas used the rifle accessories to kill 58 people and wound more than 500 others at a music festival. His campaign chairman is Dogg the Bounty Hunter, and he posed with a militia group last summer at an anti-sharia rally.\nGeorgia’s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, is expected to win the Republican primary. He won 41% of Republican voters in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution/Channel 2 Action News poll.\nSecretary of State Brian Kemp got 10% of voters’ support, and former state Sen. Hunter Hill had 9%, while Clay Tippins got 4%, and Williams had just 3%. Still, about one-third of Republican primary voters in Georgia remained undecided .", "external_links": ["https://www.forsythnews.com/local/state-government/dog-bounty-hunter-endorses-williams-governor-bid/", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvtj0DqY4Y", "https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/georgia-governor-candidate-bump-stock/index.html", "https://t.co/fEATVD8GM4", "https://politics.myajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-gop-candidate-poses-with-controversial-militia-anti-sharia-rally/m3qu6AFntu75CoPKQC5MKM/", "https://williamsgeorgia.com/deportation-bus-tour/", "https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/ajc-poll-cagle-leads-gop-race-for-governor-tight-race-for-spot/zJvzNReQtQBJJvzhZ0uciL/"], "published": "2018-05-16T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:17:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
