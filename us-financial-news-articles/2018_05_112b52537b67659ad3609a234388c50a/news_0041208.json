Unfortunately just didn’t cash in,” he said after finishing seven strokes behind winner Webb Simpson.\n“If I would have had the game I had this weekend at the beginning of the week I would have given Webb a little bit of a run.”\nWoods will have only one more start, at the Memorial tournament in two weeks, to hone his game before the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.\nHe has been in contention in the final round in four of his eight starts this year.\n“I’m not that far off from winning,” he said. “There’s no way at the beginning of the year that I would have predicted I would have been at this point.” (Reporting by Andrew Both; editing by Ian Ransom)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T04:48:30.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
