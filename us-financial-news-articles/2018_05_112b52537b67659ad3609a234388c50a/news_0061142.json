REUTERS/Andrew Kelly The effectiveness of Xeljanz in treating ulcerative colitis was shown in three controlled clinical trials, including two trials that showed the drug caused disease remission in about 17-18 percent of the patients.\nThe drug is already approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.\nXeljanz is expected to bring in sales of $2.16 billion in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It had generated sales of $1.35 billion in 2017.\nUlcerative colitis is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and causes recurrent flares of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.\nMore than 900,000 people suffer from the disease in the United States, according to the FDA.\nPfizer’s shares were up 1.1 percent at $36.11 in afternoon trading.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Anil D'Silva\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:36:21.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
