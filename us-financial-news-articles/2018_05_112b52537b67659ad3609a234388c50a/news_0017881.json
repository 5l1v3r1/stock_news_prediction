Our discussions with clients remain very active, and the investments we have made over the past several years to strengthen our product line continue to position us well for future growth,” Mr. Daly added.\nFiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance\nPrior 1 Current Recurring fee revenue growth 4-6% 4-6% Total revenue growth 2-4% 2-4% Operating income margin - GAAP ~14% ~14% Adjusted Operating income margin - Non-GAAP ~16% ~16% Diluted earnings per share growth 2 22-26% 28-33% Adjusted Earnings per share growth 2 - Non-GAAP 27-31% 31-35% Free cash flow 2 - Non-GAAP $500-550M $500-550M Closed sales $170-210M $170-210M 1 Prior guidance as of February 8, 2018. 2 Current EPS Guidance and Free cash flow Guidance includes projected $35 million, or $0.27 per share, from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Financial Results for the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018\nRevenues\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (\"third quarter of fiscal year 2018\") increased 6% to $1,072 million from $1,009 million in the prior year period.\nRecurring fee revenues rose 8% to $639 million. The increase in recurring fee revenues reflected organic growth of 7%, including internal growth (4pts), gains from Net New Business (3pts) and contributions from our recent acquisitions (1pt). Event-driven fee revenues rose 9% to $67 million, primarily from increased equity proxy contests which were partially offset by decreased mutual fund proxy activity. Distribution revenues increased $9 million, or 2%, to $385 million. Changes in foreign currency rates positively impacted revenues by $1 million as compared to the prior year period.\nOperating Income\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nOperating income was $130 million, an increase of $20 million, or 19%, compared to $110 million for the prior year period. Operating income margin increased to 12.1%, compared to 10.9% for the prior year period. Adjusted Operating income was $152 million, an increase of $18 million, or 13%, compared to $134 million for the prior year period. Adjusted Operating income margin increased to 14.1%, compared to 13.2% for the prior year period. The increases in Operating income margin and Adjusted Operating income margin are primarily due to the increase in recurring fee revenues.\nInterest Expense and Other Non-Operating Income\nInterest expense, net for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $9 million, a decrease of $2 million, or 17%, compared to $11 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense of $1 million and a $1 million increase in interest income.\nOther non-operating income, net was $4 million, a decrease of $3 million, or 43%, compared to $7 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $4 million in investment gains.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 12.9% compared to 28.6% for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the recognition of a $16 million excess tax benefit attributable to stock-based compensation as well as the corporate tax rate change under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Share\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nNet earnings increased 44% to $109 million, compared to $76 million for the prior year period. Adjusted Net earnings increased 46% to $121 million, compared to $83 million for the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 43% to $0.90, compared to $0.63 for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share increased 45% to $1.00 compared to $0.69 for the prior year period.\nSegment and Other Results for Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018\nInvestor Communication Solutions (\"ICS\")\nICS revenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $855 million, an increase of $35 million, or 4%, compared to $820 million for the prior year period.\nRecurring fee revenues rose $20 million, or 5%, to $403 million. The increase was attributable to: (i) internal growth (2pts), (ii) Net New Business from increases in revenues from Closed sales (2pts) and (iii) revenues from acquisitions (1pt). Event-driven fee revenues increased $6 million, or 9%, to $67 million, the result of increased equity proxy contest activity which was partially offset by decreased mutual fund proxy activity. Position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 8% for mutual fund and exchange traded fund (\"ETF\") interims. Distribution revenues increased $9 million, or 2%, to $385 million.\nEarnings before income taxes for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $93 million, an increase of $18 million, or 23%, compared to $75 million for the prior year period, primarily due to higher recurring fee revenues and event-driven fee revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 1.7 percentage points to 10.9% from 9.2%.\nGlobal Technology and Operations (\"GTO\")\nGTO revenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $235 million, an increase of $27 million, or 13%, compared to $209 million in the prior year period. The increase was attributable to: (i) internal growth from higher trade and non-trade activity levels (7pts), (ii) higher Net New Business from Closed sales (4pts), and (iii) revenue from acquisitions (1pt).\nGTO earnings before income taxes were $57 million, an increase of $15 million, or 34%, compared to $43 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher organic revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 3.9 percentage points to 24.4% from 20.5%.\nOther\nOther Pre-tax loss increased 101% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 to $29 million from $14 million in the prior year period. The increased loss was primarily due to higher expense related to corporate charges, including efficiency and growth initiatives, higher performance-based compensation expense of $5 million and a decrease of $4 million in investment gains in the current year period.\nFinancial Results for the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues\nRevenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 increased 8% to $3,009 million from $2,797 million in the prior year period.\nRecurring fee revenues rose 6% to $1,749 million. The increase in recurring fee revenues reflected organic growth of 5%, including 3% from Net New Business, 2% from internal growth and 1% from our recent acquisitions. Event-driven fee revenues rose 74% to $223 million, primarily from increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests.\nDistribution revenues increased $12 million, or 1%, to $1,090 million. Changes in foreign currency rates positively impacted revenues by $2 million as compared to the prior year period.\nOperating Income\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018:\nOperating income was $330 million, an increase of $95 million, or 40%, compared to $235 million for the prior year period. Operating income margin increased to 10.9%, compared to 8.4% for the prior year period. Adjusted Operating income was $395 million, an increase of $95 million, or 32%, compared to $299 million for the prior year period. Adjusted Operating income margin increased to 13.1%, compared to 10.7% for the prior year period. The increases in Operating income margin and Adjusted Operating income margin are primarily due to the increase in event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues.\nInterest Expense and Other Non-Operating Expenses\nInterest expense, net for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was $29 million, a decrease of $3 million, or 10%, compared to $32 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to $2 million of lower interest expense and a $1 million increase in interest income.\nOther non-operating income, net was $2 million, an increase of $1 million, or 163%, compared to $1 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to lower expense of $3 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and lower losses related to minority equity investments of $2 million partially offset by a decrease of $4 million in investment gains.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was 27.0%, compared to 31.4% for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the recognition of a $19 million excess tax benefit attributable to stock-based compensation as well as a reduced federal rate, partially offset by $16 million of net tax charges relating to the enactment of the Tax Act.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company incurred a net total of $16 million (\"the net tax charge\") tax expense resulting from the recent changes to U.S. tax laws. These expenses included $32 million in charges relating to earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes. The charges were offset by a $16 million benefit from the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities.\nExcluding the $19 million excess tax benefit and the net tax charge of $16 million, the provision for income taxes would have been $84 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, and the effective tax rate would have been 27.9%.\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Share\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018:\nNet earnings increased 58% to $221 million, compared to $140 million for the prior year period. Adjusted Net earnings increased 61% to $280 million, compared to $174 million for the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 60% to $1.84, compared to $1.15 for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share increased 63% to $2.33 compared to $1.43 for the prior year period.\nSegment and Other Results for Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018\nInvestor Communication Solutions\nICS revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 were $2,384 million, an increase of $141 million, or 6%, compared to $2,243 million for the prior year period.\nRecurring fee revenues rose $35 million, or 3%, to $1,071 million. The increase was attributable to: (i) Net New Business from increases in revenues from Closed sales (2pts), internal growth (1pt) and (ii) revenues from acquisitions (1pt). Event-driven fee revenues increased $95 million, or 74%, to $223 million, the result of increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests. Position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 10% for mutual fund and ETF interims. Distribution revenues increased $12 million to $1,090 million.\nEarnings before income taxes for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 were $211 million, an increase of $80 million, or 62%, compared to $131 million for the prior year period, primarily due to higher event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 3.1 percentage points to 8.9% from 5.8%.\nGlobal Technology and Operations\nGTO revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 were $678 million, an increase of $69 million, or 11%, compared to $609 million in the prior year period. The increase was attributable to: (i) higher Net New Business from Closed sales (5pts), (ii) internal growth from higher trade and non-trade activity levels (4pts) and (iii) revenue from recent acquisitions (2pts).\nGTO earnings before income taxes were $153 million, an increase of $30 million, or 24%, compared to $123 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher organic revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 2.2 percentage points to 22.5% from 20.3%.\nOther\nOther Pre-tax loss increased 33% in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 to $77 million from $58 million in the prior year period. The increased loss was primarily due to higher expense related to corporate charges, including efficiency and growth initiatives, a decrease of $4 million in investment gains and higher performance based compensation expense of $4 million in the current year period.\nChanges in U.S. Federal Tax Laws\nThe Tax Act was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. One of the primary provisions of this new legislation is a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate to 21% from 35%. With a fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, Broadridge's full year corporate rate will be subject to a blended rate that includes both the new and old rates. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, the Company will realize the full benefit of the lower corporate statutory rate in its provision for income taxes.\nIn addition, as a result of the changes in tax laws, Broadridge incurred a net charge of $16 million tax expense related to the repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities. This amount is provisional and represents the Company's best estimate of the expected impact from the tax law changes. The ultimate impact of these changes may differ from Broadridge's estimate due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, as well as the amount of our fiscal year 2018 earnings before taxes.\nAcquisition of ActivePath\nIn March 2018, the Company acquired ActivePath Solutions Ltd. (\"ActivePath\"), a digital technology company with technology that enhances the consumer experience associated with consumer statements, bills, and regulatory communications. The aggregate purchase price was $25 million.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAn analyst conference call will be held today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures (“Non-GAAP”). These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Operating income margin, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results.\nThe Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.\nAdjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings per Share\nThese Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of: (i) Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, (ii) Acquisition and Integration Costs, (iii) Tax Act items, (iv) the Gain on Sale of Securities and (v) the Message Automation Limited (\"MAL\") investment gain. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities. Tax Act items represent the net impact of a U.S. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the Tax Act. The Gain on Sale of Securities represents a non-operating gain on the sale of securities associated with the Company's retirement plan obligations. The MAL investment gain represents a non-cash, nontaxable gain on investment from the Company’s acquisition of MAL in March 2017.\nWe exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs, Tax Act items, Gain on Sale of Securities and the MAL investment gain from our earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. Management believes these adjusted measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software.\nReconciliations of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables that are part of this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and other written or oral statements made from time to time by representatives of Broadridge may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
