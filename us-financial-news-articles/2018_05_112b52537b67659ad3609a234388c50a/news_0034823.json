The vast majority of the new store openings will be Pizza Hut, including all stores in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe deal would make Telepizza, Pizza Hut’s largest master franchisee globally by store count.\nPizza Hut has been posting weak sales and has missing same-store sales estimates for the last two quarters, according to Consensus Metrix.\nThe Telepizza deal is not expected to have a significant impact on Yum Brands’ core operating results or cash flows over the next few years, the companies said.\nThe Spanish chain, which operates in 23 countries and owns brands such as Telepizza and Jeno’s Pizza, reported sales of about 561 million euros ($664.28 million) in 2017.\n(This story Corrects to remove reference to more franchises in paragraph 5.)\nReporting by Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T11:05:17.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
