Both parties have said they want to head off a value-added tax increase worth 12.5 billion euros ($14.9 billion) due to kick in next year unless alternative deficit cutting measures are found.\n“The government will be rational and reasonable (with the public accounts),” the source said. “We want to show courtesy,” he said, adding that the administration would discuss any planned deficit increases with Brussels first.
