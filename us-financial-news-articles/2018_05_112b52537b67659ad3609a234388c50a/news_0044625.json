Its push into business banking comes at a time when the incumbent large banks are coming under heavy criticism from lawmakers for their treatment of small businesses.\nNationwide reported an annual profit of 977 million pounds, down from 1.05 billion pounds a year earlier.\nIt was Nationwide’s second consecutive year of declining profits, which it blamed on costs from buying back its own debt as well as increased competition and low interest rates.\nUnlike its rival listed banks such as Lloyds and RBS which have a goal of delivering ever higher profits to their shareholders, Nationwide operates as a society owned by its customers and said it will be comfortable keeping annual profits at between 0.9 to 1.3 billion pounds per year.\nThe lender said it has launched a review of its technology investment and will announce the results in the Autumn, as rivals crank up their spending to ward off the threat from startup digital banks and the big global technology firms.
