Percentage variances in the Consolidated Performance Highlights below are calculated and presented on a local currency basis, unless otherwise noted.\nNote: The company adopted ASC 606 and revised its non-GAAP definition \"Fee revenue\" in the first quarter of 2018. Refer to the footnotes following the Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nConsolidated First-Quarter 2018 Performance Highlights:\nConsolidated revenue and consolidated fee revenue growth was broad-based across all four segments and increased 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. Fee revenue expansion in the RES service lines was led by Capital Markets and Project & Development Services. Geographically across the service lines, the increase in RES fee revenue, on a local currency basis, was driven by EMEA (50 percent) and Americas (40 percent).\nConsolidated operating expenses, excluding reimbursed expenses, were $1.8 billion and consolidated fee-based operating expenses 1 , excluding restructuring and acquisition charges, were $1.2 billion, increases of 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively, over 2017.\nLaSalle revenue growth and overall performance were primarily due to higher incentive fees earned on the disposition of real estate assets on behalf of clients. LaSalle results also reflect solid advisory fees and notable equity earnings, led by net valuation increases across the co-investment portfolio.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $40.3 million, compared with $7.2 million last year, and adjusted EBITDA increased 51 percent to $107.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin, calculated on a fee-revenue basis, was 8.4 percent in USD and local currency, compared with 6.0 percent in 2017. The consolidated results reflect strong performance in LaSalle and Americas and year-over-year improvement in EMEA, partially offset by a slight decline in Asia Pacific. In addition, results also reflect continued increases to investments in data, technology and people, including amounts attributable to platform transformation and client-facing products.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.88, compared with $0.16 in 2017, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.97, up from $0.37 last year.\nBalance Sheet and Net Interest Expense:\nTotal net debt increased $323.9 million to $910.1 million as of March 31, 2018, but decreased $477.8 million from March 31, 2017. The quarterly increase reflected the annual first-quarter payout of variable compensation to employees for the strong 2017 business performance. The year-over-year decrease reflected the company's trailing 12-month performance and efforts to improve working capital management.\nNet interest expense was $13.8 million, an increase from $13.0 million for 2017. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to a higher effective interest rate on the company's debt, partially offset by a decline in the outstanding average borrowings.\nThe company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.41 per share, an 11 percent increase from the $0.37 per share payment made in December 2017. The dividend payment will be made on June 15, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2018.\nBusiness Segment Performance Highlights\nAmericas Real Estate Services\n($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nin USD\n%\nChange\nin LC\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n1,941.0\n$\n1,799.9\n8\n%\n8\n%\nReimbursements\n(1,181.7)\n(1,078.5)\n10\n10\nRevenue before reimbursements\n$\n759.3\n$\n721.4\n5\n%\n5\n%\nGross contract costs 1\n(133.1)\n(131.8)\n1\n1\nNet non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity\n(2.7)\n2.7\nn.m.\nn.m.\nFee revenue 1\n$\n623.5\n$\n592.3\n5\n%\n5\n%\nLeasing\n293.3\n289.9\n1\n1\nCapital Markets\n108.2\n101.5\n7\n6\nProperty & Facility Management\n110.2\n95.7\n15\n16\nProject & Development Services\n78.9\n76.3\n3\n3\nAdvisory, Consulting and Other\n32.9\n28.9\n14\n13\nOperating income\n$\n46.3\n$\n32.3\n43\n%\n44\n%\nEquity earnings\n$\n0.1\n$\n0.2\n(50)\n%\n(50)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$\n67.7\n$\n58.4\n16\n%\n16\n%\nn.m. - not meaningful as represented by a percentage change of greater than 100%, favorably or unfavorably.\n(1) For discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 1 following the Financial Statements in this news release.

Refer to the footnotes following the Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nAmericas First-Quarter 2018 Performance Highlights:\nAmericas revenue and fee revenue increased 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. This growth was led by strong Property & Facility Management performance in the U.S., due primarily to the commencement of new facility management contracts secured during 2017 along with expansions of existing mandates. Capital Markets performance was notable in Canada and also resulted from continued growth of multifamily lending and loan servicing businesses across the U.S. In addition, the solid contribution from Leasing follows a robust year-over-year double-digit growth in 2017.\nOperating expenses, excluding reimbursed expenses, were $713.0 million, up 3 percent from 2017, and fee-based operating expenses, excluding restructuring and acquisition charges, were $579.9 million, up 4 percent over 2017. These increases correlated with the growth in revenue.\nOperating income increased 44 percent and adjusted EBITDA increased 16 percent compared with the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin, calculated on a fee-revenue basis, improved to 10.9 percent in USD and local currency, compared with 9.8 percent last year, reflecting the increase in revenues noted above together with productivity gains in the quarter and timing of expenses.\nEMEA Real Estate Services\n($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nin USD\n%\nChange\nin LC\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n783.6\n$\n603.2\n30\n%\n15\n%\nReimbursements\n(156.0)\n(101.9)\n53\n36\nRevenue before reimbursements\n$\n627.6\n$\n501.3\n25\n%\n10\n%\nGross contract costs 1\n(277.2)\n(231.4)\n20\n5\nFee revenue 1\n$\n350.4\n$\n269.9\n30\n%\n15\n%\nLeasing\n57.0\n47.6\n20\n5\nCapital Markets\n84.0\n56.1\n50\n32\nProperty & Facility Management\n87.2\n79.5\n10\n(3)\nProject & Development Services\n64.9\n41.6\n56\n38\nAdvisory, Consulting and Other\n57.3\n45.1\n27\n13\nOperating loss\n$\n(20.0)\n$\n(32.0)\n(38)\n%\n(41)\n%\nEquity earnings\n$\n—\n$\n—\n—\n%\n—\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$\n(7.4)\n$\n(20.6)\n(64)\n%\n(62)\n%\n(1) For discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 1 following the Financial Statements in this news release.

Refer to the footnotes following the Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nEMEA First-Quarter 2018 Performance Highlights:\nEMEA revenue and fee revenue both increased 15 percent compared with the prior year. Fee revenue expansion was most notable in Capital Markets, driven by investment sales in Germany, France and the UK, as well as Project & Development Services across various countries, with particular contribution from the Tetris fit-out business.\nOperating expenses, excluding reimbursed expenses, increased 7 percent to $647.6 million, and fee-based operating expenses, excluding restructuring and acquisition charges, increased 9 percent to $370.4 million, compared with 2017.\nOperating loss decreased by 41 percent, compared with 2017, and adjusted EBITDA improved from a loss of $20.6 million last year to a loss of $7.4 million this year. Adjusted EBITDA margin, calculated on a fee-revenue basis, was negative 2.1 percent in USD (negative 2.5 percent in local currency), compared with negative 7.6 percent last year. The improved performance was driven by revenue growth noted above along with the management of platform cost increases. In addition, prior year performance was negatively affected by $10.1 million of costs and charges that did not recur in 2018, specifically (i) costs associated with the wind-down of operations in a non-core UK market and (ii) provisions for losses on certain receivables.\nAsia Pacific Real Estate Services\n($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nin USD\n%\nChange\nin LC\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n711.3\n$\n626.3\n14\n%\n9\n%\nReimbursements\n(321.6)\n(316.5)\n2\n(2)\nRevenue before reimbursements\n$\n389.7\n$\n309.8\n26\n%\n21\n%\nGross contract costs 1\n(195.3)\n(130.4)\n50\n44\nFee revenue 1\n$\n194.4\n$\n179.4\n8\n%\n4\n%\nLeasing\n34.8\n29.5\n18\n13\nCapital Markets\n29.0\n28.3\n2\n(1)\nProperty & Facility Management\n67.8\n64.7\n5\n1\nProject & Development Services\n29.9\n24.6\n22\n16\nAdvisory, Consulting and Other\n32.9\n32.3\n2\n(2)\nOperating (loss) income\n$\n(0.9)\n$\n5.0\nn.m.\n(97)\n%\nEquity earnings\n$\n0.3\n$\n0.8\n(63)\n%\n(50)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$\n5.0\n$\n10.6\n(53)\n%\n(44)\n%\nn.m. - not meaningful as represented by a percentage change of greater than 100%, favorably or unfavorably.\n(1) For discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 1 following the Financial Statements in this news release.

Refer to the footnotes following the Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nAsia Pacific First-Quarter 2018 Performance Highlights:\nAsia Pacific revenue and fee revenue increased 9 percent and 4 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. Fee revenue growth was led by Leasing in Beijing and Tokyo markets and Project & Development Services in Australia. Geographically across services lines, the increase in fee revenue was led by Greater China, Japan and Singapore.\nOperating expenses, excluding reimbursed expenses, were $390.6 million and fee-based operating expenses, excluding restructuring and acquisition charges, were $195.3 million, up 23 percent and 7 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. The increase in expenses reflects the growth in revenue noted above as well as $3.5 million relating to higher than anticipated costs on certain client assignments.\nThe operating loss was $0.9 million, compared with operating income of $5.0 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 44 percent compared with 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin, calculated on a fee-revenue basis, was 2.5 percent in USD for the year (3.1 percent in local currency), compared with 5.9 percent in 2017.\nLaSalle\n($ in millions, \"LC\" = local currency)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nin USD\n%\nChange\nin LC\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n119.3\n$\n88.3\n35\n%\n27\n%\nReimbursements (a)\n(4.8)\n(4.5)\n7\n4\nRevenue before reimbursements\n$\n114.5\n$\n83.8\n37\n%\n28\n%\nGross contract costs (a)\n(1.3)\n(1.4)\n(7)\n(17)\nFee revenue 1\n$\n113.2\n$\n82.4\n37\n%\n29\n%\nAdvisory fees (a)\n65.1\n57.7\n13\n6\nTransaction fees & other (a)\n15.4\n12.8\n20\n12\nIncentive fees\n32.7\n11.9\nn.m.\nn.m.\nOperating income\n$\n29.1\n$\n14.6\n99\n%\n81\n%\nEquity earnings\n$\n13.2\n$\n4.6\nn.m.\nn.m.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$\n42.4\n$\n19.6\nn.m.\nn.m.\nn.m. - not meaningful as represented by a percentage change of greater than 100%, favorably or unfavorably.\n(a) Reimbursements are entirely within Advisory fees and Gross contract costs are entirely within Other.\n(1) For discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 1 following the Financial Statements in this news release.

Refer to the footnotes following the Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nLaSalle First-Quarter 2018 Performance Highlights:\nLaSalle revenue and fee revenue increased primarily due to strong incentive fee performance associated with real estate dispositions in Asia Pacific. The increase in advisory fees followed the continued growth of the private equity business and included approximately $3 million of catch-up advisory fees earned as a result of new equity commitments in established funds.\nEquity earnings in both the current and prior years were primarily driven by net valuation increases for investments in Europe and Asia.\nOperating expenses, excluding reimbursed expenses, were $85.4 million, up 17 percent from 2017; fee-based operating expenses, excluding restructuring and acquisition charges, were $84.1 million, up 18 percent from 2017. The increases primarily reflect higher variable compensation expense as a result of the increase in incentive fees.\nOperating income increased 81 percent and adjusted EBITDA increased over 100 percent, both compared with last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.4 percent in USD (37.2 percent in local currency), compared with 23.8 percent last year.\nAssets under management were $59.0 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 2 percent in USD and local currency from $58.1 billion as of December 31, 2017. The net increase in assets under management during the year resulted from $2.7 billion of acquisitions and $1.7 billion of net valuation increases, partially offset by $3.5 billion of dispositions and withdrawals.\nAbout JLL\nJLL (NYSE: JLL) is a leading professional services firm that specializes in real estate and investment management.

LASALLE INCORPORATED\nFinancial Statement Notes\n1.\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to develop budgets and forecasts, measure and reward performance against those budgets and forecasts, and enhance comparability to prior periods. These measures are believed to be useful to investors and other external stakeholders as supplemental measures of core operating performance and include the following:\n(i) Fee revenue and Fee-based operating expenses,\n(ii) Adjusted operating income,\n(iii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin,\n(iv) Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and Adjusted diluted earnings per share, and\n(v) Percentage changes against prior periods, presented on a local currency basis.\nHowever, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Any measure that eliminates components of a company's capital structure, cost of operations or investment, or other results has limitations as a performance measure. In light of these limitations, management also considers GAAP financial measures and does not rely solely on non-GAAP financial measures. Because the company's non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjustments to GAAP Financial Measures Used to Calculate non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGross Contract Costs represent certain costs associated with client-dedicated employees and third-party vendors and subcontractors and are indirectly reimbursed through the management fee we receive. These costs are presented on a gross basis in Operating expenses with the corresponding management fee in Revenue before reimbursements. However, as we generally earn little to no margin on such costs, excluding gross contract costs from both Fee revenue and Fee-based operating expenses more accurately reflects how we manage our expense base and operating margins and also enables a more consistent performance assessment across a portfolio of contracts with varying payment terms and structures, including those with direct versus indirect reimbursement of such costs.\nNet Non-Cash Mortgage Servicing Rights (\"MSR\") and Mortgage Banking Derivative Activity consists of the balances presented within Revenue composed of (i) derivative gains/losses resulting from mortgage banking loan commitment and warehousing activity and (ii) gains recognized from the retention of MSR upon origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by (iii) amortization of MSR intangible assets over the period that net servicing income is projected to be received. Non-cash derivative gains/losses resulting from mortgage banking loan commitment and warehousing activity are calculated as the estimated fair value of loan commitments and subsequent changes thereof, primarily represented by the estimated net cash flows associated with future servicing rights. MSR gains and corresponding MSR intangible assets are calculated as the present value of estimated cash flows over the estimated mortgage servicing periods. The above activity is reported entirely within Revenue of the Capital Markets business line of the Americas segment. Excluding net non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity reflects how the company manages and evaluates performance because the excluded activity is non-cash in nature.\nRestructuring and Acquisition Charges primarily consist of: (i) severance and employment-related charges, including those related to external service providers, incurred in conjunction with a structural business shift, which can be represented by a notable change in headcount, change in leadership or transformation of business processes; (ii) acquisition and integration-related charges, including non-cash fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities recorded in purchase accounting such as earn-out liabilities and intangible assets; and (iii) lease exit charges. Such activity is excluded as the amounts are generally either non-cash in nature or the anticipated benefits from the expenditures would not likely be fully realized until future periods. Restructuring and acquisition charges are excluded from segment operating results and therefore not a line item in the segments' reconciliation from operating income to adjusted operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles , primarily composed of the estimated fair value ascribed at closing of an acquisition to assets such as acquired management contracts, customer backlog and trade name, is more notable following the company's increase in acquisition activity in recent years. Such activity is excluded as the change in period-over-period activity is generally the result of longer-term strategic decisions and therefore not necessarily indicative of core operating results. At the segment reporting level, this is the only reconciling difference between operating income and adjusted operating income, except for the Americas segment, where Net non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity is also excluded.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nBelow are reconciliations of (i) Revenue to Fee revenue, (ii) Operating expenses to Fee-based operating expenses, and (iii) Operating income to Adjusted operating income:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n3,555.2\n$\n3,117.7\nReimbursements\n(1,664.1)\n(1,501.4)\nRevenue before reimbursements\n$\n1,891.1\n$\n1,616.3\nGross contract costs\n(606.9)\n(495.0)\nNet non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity\n(2.7)\n2.7\nFee revenue\n$\n1,281.5\n$\n1,124.0\nOperating expenses\n$\n3,501.4\n$\n3,102.3\nReimbursed expenses\n(1,664.1)\n(1,501.4)\nGross contract costs\n(606.9)\n(495.0)\nFee-based operating expenses\n$\n1,230.4\n$\n1,105.9\nOperating income\n$\n53.8\n$\n15.4\nAdjustments:\nRestructuring and acquisition charges 5\n0.7\n4.5\nNet non-cash MSR and mortgage banking derivative activity\n(2.7)\n2.7\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n7.3\n7.6\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n59.1\n$\n30.2\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to common shareholders (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") represents EBITDA attributable to common shareholders (\"EBITDA\") further adjusted for certain items management does not consider directly indicative of the company's ongoing performance in the context of certain performance measurements.

Amounts presented on a local currency basis are calculated by translating the current period results of foreign operations to U.S. dollars using the foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period. Management believes this methodology provides a framework for assessing performance and operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The following table reflects the reconciliation to local currency amounts for consolidated (i) revenue, (ii) fee revenue, (iii) operating income, and (iv) Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n($ in millions)\n2018\n% Change\nRevenue:\nAt current period exchange rates\n$\n3,555.2\n14\n%\nImpact of change in exchange rates\n(125.9)\nn/a\nAt comparative period exchange rates\n$\n3,429.3\n10\n%\nFee revenue:\nAt current period exchange rates\n$\n1,281.5\n14\n%\nImpact of change in exchange rates\n(55.0)\nn/a\nAt comparative period exchange rates\n$\n1,226.5\n9\n%\nOperating income:\nAt current period exchange rates\n$\n53.8\n250\n%\nImpact of change in exchange rates\n0.2\nn/a\nAt comparative period exchange rates\n$\n54.0\n251\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nAt current period exchange rates\n$\n107.7\n58\n%\nImpact of change in exchange rates\n(5.0)\nn/a\nAt comparative period exchange rates\n$\n102.7\n51\n%\n2.\nThe company considers Annuity Revenue to be (i) 100% of Property & Facility Management, (ii) 50% of Leasing, (iii) 50% of Project & Development Services, and (iv) 50% of Advisory, Consulting and Other Revenue, as well as (v) LaSalle Advisory Fees. For purposes of distinguishing organic from acquisition-related contributions, the population of acquisitions includes those completed in the trailing four quarters inclusive of the current reported quarter.\n3.\nEach geographic region offers the company's full range of RES businesses consisting primarily of (i) tenant representation and agency leasing, (ii) capital markets, (iii) property management and facilities management, (iv) project and development services, and (v) advisory, consulting and valuations services. LaSalle provides investment management services to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals.\n4.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASC 606\") on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASC 606, together with the continued changes in our business mix, prompted the company to expand the types of costs excluded from the calculation of the non-GAAP measure \"Fee revenue.\" Specifically, the drivers were (i) the increase in compensation and benefits associated with client-dedicated personnel presented on a gross basis and (ii) the expansion of annuity businesses engaged to provide outsourced services to clients.\nThe most notable change is the inclusion of compensation and benefits associated with client-dedicated employees in gross contract costs. In addition, the previous calculation of gross contract costs applied to only Project & Development Services and Property & Facility Management but now applies to all service lines and businesses. The largest impacts of the change to the company's definition of fee revenue are within Project & Development Services and Property & Facility Management.\nAdditional materials were provided in the company's recent podcast, available on the company's website ( ir.jll.com ) and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on Form 8-K dated April 30, 2018. For additional commentary on the adoption of ASC 606 and the change to the fee revenue calculation, refer to the company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, to be filed with the SEC in the near future.\n5.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges are excluded from the company's measure of segment operating results, although they are included for consolidated Operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of segment operating results, the allocation of restructuring and acquisition charges to the segments is not a component of management's assessment of segment performance.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges were $0.7 million and $4.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Charges in 2018 included (a) $1.3 million of severance and other employment-related charges incurred with respect to headcount reductions or other activities considered to represent structural changes to local, regional, and/or global business operations and (b) $0.6 million of costs incurred for pre-acquisition due diligence and post-acquisition integration activities, partially offset by (c) $1.2 million of net non-cash fair value adjustments relating to a net decrease to earn-out liabilities that arose from prior period acquisition activity. Comparatively, charges in 2017 included (a) $3.5 million of severance and other employment-related charges and (b) $3.8 million of costs incurred for pre-acquisition due diligence and post-acquisition integration activities, partially offset by (c) $2.8 million of net non-cash fair value adjustments relating to a net decrease to earn-out liabilities that arose from prior period acquisition activity.\n6.\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows are presented in summarized form. For complete consolidated statements of cash flows, please refer to the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, to be filed with the SEC in the near future.\n7.\nEMEA refers to Europe, Middle East and Africa.

The BRIC countries include Brazil, Russia, India and China. Benelux refers to Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n8.\nAs of March 31, 2018, LaSalle had $59.0 billion of real estate assets under management with approximately $8 billion available for investment (\"dry powder\") contemplating committed capital and available borrowing capacity at traditional leverage levels. Assets under management were composed of $32.7 billion invested in separate accounts, $17.3 billion invested in fund management vehicles and $9.0 billion invested in public securities.
