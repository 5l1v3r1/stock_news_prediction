(the \"Company\" or \"PPG\") (NYSE: PPG). The investigation focuses on possible breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws.\nOn May 10, 2018, after the market closed, the Company announced that its Audit Committee found evidence of \"improper accounting entries\" in its investigation into allegations of violations of the Company's accounting policies. This announcement followed PPG's April 19 disclosure that its internal reporting system identified several million dollars of improperly accrued expenses in the first quarter of 2018. As result, the Company reported that it would be delaying its financial statement for the period ending March 31, 2018. On that news, PPG shares traded for as low as $100.43, approximately 6% less than its May 10 opening price of $107.26.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether PPG's Board (1) failed to meet the recordkeeping requirements and accounting provisions established by federal securities laws; (2) failed to establish and/or maintain comprehensive internal controls to safeguard against financial reporting errors; and consequently, (3) reported materially false and misleading public statements. If you own PPG shares and wish to discuss this investigation or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Joshua Rubin of WeissLaw LLP at (888)593-4771 , or by e-mail at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/ppg-industries-inc/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-ppg-industries-inc-is-the-subject-of-a-legal-investigation-300647759.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-ppg-industries-inc-is-the-subject-of-a-legal-investigation-300647759.html", "http://www.weisslawllp.com/ppg-industries-inc/"], "published": "2018-05-14T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T19:42:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
