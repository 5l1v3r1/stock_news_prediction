Why only three days from the vote are people only suddenly raising that?”\n“It’s not a realistic alternative. It is just a tactic and I believe the Irish people will see through that.” A woman walks past a new Pro-Choice mural by a graffiti artist collective called 'Subset' ahead of a 25th May referendum on abortion law, in Dublin, Ireland May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\nWhile not on the ballot paper, much of the campaign has focused on the legislation Varadkar intends to bring forward if the referendum is carried, which calls for terminations with no restrictions to be allowed up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy.\nThat was in line with recommendations made by an all-party parliamentary committee, which came to a more liberal position than some had anticipated after concluding that legislating for termination for reasons of rape and incest was too complex.\nThe leaders of Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein, the two largest opposition parties, backed Varadkar in saying amending the constitution for such cases was impossible.\nHowever ‘No’ campaigners, which include more than half of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party, say the government’s proposals go too far.\n“The government has used difficult, tragic cases to push through extreme abortion on demand. This is why people are increasingly voting “NO” to abortion this Friday,” Clare McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the LoveBoth group said in a statement.
