So what’s the totally-not-the-Terminator’s-grandfather doing now?\nRunning—as usual, in a convincing and therefore quite alarming fashion.\nBoston Dynamics, a former Google (googl) unit that’s these days part of Japanese mega-conglomerate SoftBank (sftby) , released a new video on Thursday that showed Atlas going for a jog.\nAtlas also jumps over a log, although we’ve seen it do that before. Then again, it apparently needed to stop before making that jump, so perhaps we’ve identified the best way of slowing down the marauding robot hordes.\nThe Atlas video wasn’t the only clip Boston Dynamics released yesterday. It also published this footage of SpotMini—a vaguely canine robot that we saw opening doors earlier this year—autonomously navigating its way through an office and lab.\nSpotMini was trained for that excursion by being driven through the facilities before, but with that memory in its system, it could apparently make its own way—negotiating stairs along the way—without bumping into things.\nGood boy? We certainly hope so.
