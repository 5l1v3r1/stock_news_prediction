U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that Washington would agree to lift sanctions on North Korea if the country agrees to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, a move that would create economic prosperity that “will rival” that of South Korea.\n“It looks like the markets want to move up, and there seems to be a rosier outlook for geopolitics especially North Korea,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.05 percent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.38 percent, reaching its highest level in about two months. The dollar fell as investors questioned whether a rally that last week sent the greenback to more than four-month highs had run out of steam.\nThe dollar index fell 0.15 percent, with the euro up 0.23 percent to $1.1969.\n“The momentum behind the dollar move is starting to stall a little bit,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.\nYields on key U.S. and European bonds rose after a European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could give fresh guidance on the timing it its first rate hike as the end of its bond purchases approaches.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.9951 percent, from 2.971 percent late on Friday, Benchmark German 10-year bond yields climbed to a 2-1/2-week high.\nU.S. crude rose 0.34 percent to $70.94 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.85, up 0.95 percent on the day.\nAdditional reporting by Karen Brettell in New York, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, Kit Rees in London Editing by Gareth Jones and Nick Zieminski\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
