The revenue increase of 101% was attributable in large part to blended growth rates of 69% growth in North American revenues primarily attributable to double digit growth in existing accounts and new distribution expansion. European sales achieved 118% growth mainly as a result of the launch of a BCAA Celsius line extension in Northern Europe and in Asia revenues grew 100% mainly as a result of our initial product line launch in China. The increase in revenue from the 2017 period to the 2018 period was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing.\nGross profit\nGross profit was $4.8 million, or 39.5% of revenue, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.4 million, or 39.7% of revenue, for the same period in 2017.\nTotal Operating Expense\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $5.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 160% from $2.2 million in the same period in 2017. The increase is due primarily to increases in investments in human resources and increases in marketing programs in Asia (including initial launch of our products in China) totaling $2.4 million and increased investments in North American marketing programs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $2.00 million, a decrease of $0.06 million, or 2.9%, from $2.06 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to savings in human resources associated with a $423,000 CEO retirement compensation payment paid in 2017, which was offset by investments in human resources of $226,000, increases in insurance cost $30,000, increases in professional fees $76,000, increased investments in research and development costs $50,000, increases in depreciation expense $4,000, offset by savings in option expense of $11,000.\nTotal other expense decreased to approximately $38,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $48,000 for the same period in 2017, as a result of savings in interest expense.\nNet Income (Loss)\nAs a result of the above, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, Celsius had a net loss of $2.9 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $83,000, a net loss available to common stockholders of $3.0 million or ($0.06) per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average of 47,449,553 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, the company had a net loss of $1.9 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $90,000, a net loss available to common stockholders of $2.0 million or ($0.05) per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average of 41,783,853 shares outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had cash of $10.0 million compared to $14.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The company had working capital of $18.5 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $20.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nCash used in operations during the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $4.3 million. The company incurred a net loss of $3.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, increasing the accumulated deficit to $64.9 million as of March 31, 2018.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today, Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 4:30 pm ET to discuss the results with the investment community.\nTo participate in the conference call, please call one of the following telephone numbers at least 10 minutes before the start of the call:\nU.S.:\n877-709-8150\nInternational:\n201-689-8354\nAn audio replay of the call will be available on the Company's website at https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/news/ .\nDisclosures can be found on the Company's online disclosure portal at: https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/sec-filings/ .\nAbout Celsius Holdings, Inc.\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.
