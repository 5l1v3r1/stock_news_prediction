We have ambitious plans for the future, and David and Angie’s skills and experience will enable us to accelerate our connectivity programs.”\n“Since GEEKS’ inception, I have admired the Founders’ vision and the strategic approach of the team and their advisors,” Mr. Hartshorn said. “I’m honored to have the opportunity, at this moment in history, to pursue the organization’s goal of positively impacting the lives of a billion people through the innovative use of technology, connectivity and sustainable social enterprise models. In addition to helping to expand and accelerate the rollout of GEEKS’ current initiatives, I look forward to establishing a global community and platform to help close the digital divide by bringing communications-enabled health, education, security and other solutions to unserved and underserved global communities.”\nGEEKS’ co-founder John Morris said, “David has extensive experience of the satellite eco system, the broader communications sector and the global NGO community and this, together with Angie’s international experience at Intelsat and GVF, will help GEEKS to build on its previous successes and to move forward at a faster and more informed rate.”\nGEEKS’ co-founder Chris Stott said, “In recognizing the vital role of broadband in building and transforming economies and societies and achieving the SDGs, governments are increasingly willing to collaborate and work in innovative ways with the private sector.
