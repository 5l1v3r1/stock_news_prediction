GAAP loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.9 million, or $0.11 per share, and non-GAAP loss was $1.2 million, or $0.06 per share. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nNon-GAAP loss and adjusted EBITDA are described below under “Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, GAAP income (loss), in the accompanying tables.\nMing Hsieh, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased with the results we achieved in the first quarter, highlighted by our billable test volume, which reached the highest quarterly level we have seen in the history of our company. We are aiming to achieve increased stability in our business as we gain traction with some of our newer initiatives, including our Beacon carrier screening test. We are also seeing increased interest and revenue from our sequencing as a service research tests. While it is still early in the year, we are happy with our progress this year to date and confident in our technology, operations and sales capabilities. We look forward to capitalizing on the opportunity we see for our business in the quarters ahead.”\nPaul Kim, Chief Financial Officer, said, “We had a strong quarter and are encouraged by the momentum and sustainability we are beginning to see in our business. We recorded growth in billable test volume in the quarter, while our average price per billable test delivered remained relatively stable. In addition, our gross margin was stable as we are making progress on collecting on tests processed through insurance. We believe we are well-positioned to continue driving growth as we capitalize on the investments we have made in the business.”\nMr. Kim added, “We will provide an update on our guidance regarding certain financial measures during our investment community conference call to shortly follow the issuance of this press release.”\nConference Call Information\nFulgent Genetics will host a conference call for the investment community today at 4:30 PM ET (1:30 PM PT) to discuss its first quarter results.

Fulgent Genetics believes this information is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the performance of Fulgent’s business excluding certain income or expense items that management believes are not directly attributable to the company’s core operating results. Fulgent Genetics defines non-GAAP income (loss) as income (loss) calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), plus or minus provisions (benefits) for income taxes, plus equity-based compensation expenses, plus or minus equity income (loss) in investee, plus or minus the effect of a corporate tax rate, and plus or minus other charges or gains, as identified, that management believes are not representative of the company’s core operations. Fulgent Genetics defines adjusted EBITDA as GAAP income (loss) plus or minus interest expense (income), plus or minus provisions (benefits) for income taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, plus equity-based compensation expenses, plus or minus equity income (loss) in investee, and plus or minus other charges or gains, as identified, that management believes are not representative of the company’s core operations.\nFulgent Genetics may continue to incur expenses similar to the items added to or subtracted from GAAP income (loss) to calculate non-GAAP income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA; accordingly, the exclusion of these items in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of income (loss) in evaluating the company's operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in conformity with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by Fulgent Genetics may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies.\nAbout Fulgent Genetics\nFulgent Genetics is a technology company with a focus on offering comprehensive genetic testing to provide physicians with clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the quality of patient care. The company has developed a proprietary technology platform that allows it to offer a broad and flexible test menu and continually expand and improve its proprietary genetic reference library, while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times.
