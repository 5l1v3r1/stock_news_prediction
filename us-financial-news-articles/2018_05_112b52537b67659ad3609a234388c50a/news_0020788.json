REUTERS/Carlos Jasso Lopez Obrador, ahead by double digits in all major polls, has threatened to cancel the new $13 billion airport, arguing it is full of corruption and too expensive.\nHis position on the airport and commitment to review contracts signed with oil majors under an energy reform in recent years, along with high-profile sparring with some Mexican tycoons, worry some investors.\nLeftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), speaks during the 16th National Tourism Forum at the Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City, Mexico May 7, 2018.

REUTERS/Carlos Jasso “Why don’t we do a concession? I wouldn’t have a problem,” said the candidate, who wants to stimulate the economy with an infrastructure push. “I’m not going to put half of public investment into one project,” he added.\nThe same idea was recently raised publicly by Mexico’s richest man, Carlos Slim, who said he did not understand why the project was not privately financed in a concession.\nLopez Obrador’s softer language and the prospect of a concession reflect the tone of his comments at a campaign rally on Sunday, where he tried to take the heat out of an exchange with a group of businessmen he has accused of corruption.\n“Look, purely by coincidence I have a white handkerchief,” he said in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, waving it as a symbol of the “peace and love” he said he wanted with business. He said his argument was with a small group that had benefited from close ties to government, not businesses in general.\nLast week, Lopez Obrador named several members of Mexico’s elite he said were “influence traffickers” that benefit from corruption, provoking outrage and a full-page newspaper ad from a powerful business coalition, condemning what they described as personal attacks and slander.\nA separate business body, CCE, on Monday published a letter assuring that they were part of the solution, not the problem.\nReporting by Christine Murray and Diego Ore; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T20:40:23.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
