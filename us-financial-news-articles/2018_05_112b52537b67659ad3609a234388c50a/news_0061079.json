US$76.5 million will be paid at closing and the balance of US$12 million will be paid within six months of closing of the Transaction.

New Stratus has substantially completed its due diligence and the parties are now proceeding with the negotiation of one or more definitive agreements in relation to the Transaction (the “ Definitive Agreement ”).

The Subscription Receipts will be deemed to be converted on the earlier of: (i) the third business day after a receipt is issued for a final prospectus (a “ Final Prospectus ”) by the securities regulatory authorities in the Canadian offering jurisdictions, qualifying the Common Shares to be issued upon conversion of the Subscription Receipts and Warrants; and (ii) four months and a day after the closing date of the Offering.

Except for statements of historical fact, certain information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements, which include expectations about the completion of the Transaction and the Offering, the satisfaction of the escrow release conditions and management’s expectations with respect to the Offering and the Transaction, and are based on the Corporation’s current internal expectations, estimates, projections, assumptions and beliefs, which may prove to be incorrect. Some of the forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of conditional or future tenses or by the use of such words such as “will”, “expects”, “may”, “should”, “estimates”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, “plans”, and similar expressions, including variations thereof and negative forms.\nIn respect of the forward-looking statements and information concerning the anticipated completion of the Transaction and the Offering and the anticipated timing for completion of the Transaction and the Offering, the Corporation has provided them in reliance on certain assumptions that it believes are reasonable at this time, including assumptions as to the ability of the Corporation to receive, in a timely manner, the necessary regulatory and other third party approvals, and the ability of the Corporation to satisfy, in a timely manner, the conditions to the closing of the Transaction, and that the Offering is completed as anticipated. These dates may change for a number of reasons, including the inability to secure necessary regulatory or other third party approvals in the time assumed or the need for additional time to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the Transaction. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements and information contained in this news release concerning these times.\nForward-looking statements also relate to the business of each of the Corporation and Vetra. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Such forward-looking statements necessarily involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially from any projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of the transactions as described herein; the ability to successfully integrate operations and realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction; incorrect assessments of the value of acquisitions; changes in commodity prices and exchange rates; currency and interest rate fluctuations; the ability to secure adequate financing; and management’s ability to anticipate and manage the foregoing factors and risks. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. New Stratus undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s estimates or opinions should change except as required by applicable securities laws.\nStatements relating to “reserves” are by their nature forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future. The recovery and reserve estimates of the reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\nThe reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. New Stratus disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by securities legislation.\nNew Stratus has included the above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward looking information provided in this news release in order to provide shareholders with a more complete perspective on the Transaction and Offering and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits may be derived there from.\nThis news release refers to certain financial measures that are not determined in accordance with Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles applicable to publicly traded companies in Canada (“ GAAP ”). Measures such as, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), are not standard measures under GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other entities. Management believes that this supplemental measure facilitates the understanding of the acquisition metrics of the Transaction. These financial measures are considered additional GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures. Readers are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with GAAP as an indication of performance.\nThis press release is not an offer of the securities for sale in the United States.
