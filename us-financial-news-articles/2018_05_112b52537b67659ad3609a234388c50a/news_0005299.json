It dropped 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.\nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 288.6 million rupees so far this year through April 25, central bank data showed. $1 = 156.7000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sunil Nair", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T14:44:01.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
