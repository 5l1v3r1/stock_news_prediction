I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players.”\nHe said he does prefer that players stand, but that decision is not up to him.\n“There are some big, complicated issues that we’re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines. I don’t want to come down on them like a ton of bricks, and I won’t,” Johnson added. “There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, that’s just something I’ll have to bear.”\nLeague owners voted to adopt the new policy , which says that if players do not want to participate in the anthem, they can remain in the locker room. But if they are on the field, they must stand or their club will face a fine from the league. Individual clubs can also issue their own fines.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that owners voted unanimously to rescind the old rules and approve the new ones. But Jed York of the San Francisco 49ers said his team abstained from the vote, according to the New York Times .\nJohnson had been critical of the new anthem policy, according to Newsday , but he voted for it because he plans to pay any fines himself and will not sanction players.\n“I have a really good relationship with the players, and I hope we can keep that going and I trust that we will,” he told the newspaper. “I’m so proud of our players and their efforts to date. I think that is the most important thing to get across. I could not be more proud of the guys.”\n", "external_links": ["http://time.com/5288795/nfl-national-anthem-kneeling-rule/", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000933962/article/roger-goodells-statement-on-national-anthem-policy", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/jets/national-anthem-christopher-johnson-fines-1.18700702", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/sports/nfl-anthem-kneeling.html", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000933971/article/nfl-owners-approve-national-anthem-policy-for-2018"], "published": "2018-05-24T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:37:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
