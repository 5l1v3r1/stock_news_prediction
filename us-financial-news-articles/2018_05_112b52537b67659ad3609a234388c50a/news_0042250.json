General Electric is seen at its plant in Baden, Switzerland November 15, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\nA deal that could value the combined company at more than $20 billion (14.85 billion pounds) could be announced as early as this week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.\nThere is always a possibility that the deal talks, which centre on using a tax-efficient structure called a Reverse Morris Trust, could collapse at the last minute, the sources cautioned.\nGE and Wabtec did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
