IP made a cash and shares offer that valued the Irish group at 8.9 billion euros.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://on.ft.com/2KR7z81"], "published": "2018-05-23T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T00:12:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
