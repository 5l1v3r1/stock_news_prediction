Net income attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2018 increased 33.1% to $390,000, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2017 of $293,000, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share.\nFirst quarter revenue for the Company's proton therapy system installed at The Marjorie and Leonard Williams Center for Proton Therapy at Orlando Health – UF Health Cancer Center in Florida increased 5.5% to $1,218,000 compared to revenue of $1,155,000 for the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenue for the Company's Gamma Knife operations increased 1.9% to $3,688,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3,619,000 for the first quarter of 2017. As previously announced, AMS lost one of its Gamma Knife units due to the expiration of its contract term at the end of April 2017 and a second unit in August 2017. The decrease in revenue from these two sites was partially offset by revenue from two new sites, in Lima, Peru and Lincoln, Nebraska, that began operations in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding the two sites whose contracts expired in 2017 and the Company’s two new sites, Gamma Knife revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was consistent with the first quarter of 2017.\nRental income from medical services gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $2,206,000, or 41.6% of revenue, compared to rental income from medical services gross margin of $2,346,000, or 47.7% of revenue for the first quarter of 2017. This reflected an increase in costs of revenue primarily attributable to the initiation of maintenance and service costs for the Company’s proton system in Orlando.\nNon-GAAP pre-tax income, net of income attributable to non-controlling interest, increased 6.1% to $540,000 compared to non-GAAP pre-tax income, net of income attributable to non-controlling interest, of $509,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Please refer to the financial statements included with this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2,677,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2,616,000 for the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents was $2,751,000, compared to $2,152,000 at December 31, 2017. Shareholders' equity at March 31, 2018 was $30,590,000, or $5.36 per outstanding share. This compares to shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 of $29,885,000, or $5.23 per outstanding share.\nCEO Comments\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Ernest A. Bates, M.D., said, \"This was a strong first quarter for AMS, with the increases in revenue and earnings providing a solid foundation for the year.\n\"The profitability from our Orlando Health – UF Health Cancer Center proton therapy system was a significant contributor to first quarter results. The success of our Orlando Health system validates our belief of the economic and clinical soundness of a single room proton therapy center and we remain confident that single treatment room proton therapy represents a significant long-term growth opportunity from which AMS is uniquely positioned to benefit. With the steady flow of new studies demonstrating the clinical benefits of this advanced therapeutic technology, we remain optimistic that the pace of proton treatment volume in Orlando will increase in 2018.\n\"An increase in the average reimbursement rate compared to the Company’s historical average generated higher first quarter revenue in our Gamma Knife business as well. Volumes at our new sites in Lima, Peru and Lincoln, Nebraska continued to ramp up, and we expect these sites to be accretive in 2018. While we lost one of our Gamma Knife units due to the expiration of its contract term earlier this month, we recently announced a new contract to supply a Gamma Knife® Perfexion™ system to Methodist Hospitals–Southlake Campus , Merrillville, Indiana. This new Gamma Knife system is expected to begin treating patients in late 2018. We are seeing a resurgence in interest for the Gamma Knife both in the United States and Latin America and anticipate additional new sites coming on board. As always, we are pleased that AMS’s risk sharing arrangements will make the Gamma Knife Perfexion system available to even more brain tumor, trigeminal neuralgia and vascular malformation patients.\"\nEarnings Conference Call\nAmerican Shared has scheduled a conference call at 12:00 p.m. PDT (3:00 p.m. EDT) today.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitute for, and investors should also consider, income before income taxes, income from operations, net income attributable to the Company, earnings per share and other measures of performance as defined by GAAP as indicators of the Company's performance or profitability. We use these non-GAAP financial measures as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and charges that may not be indicative of the operating results of our recurring core business, such as stock-based compensation expense. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance.\nAMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES PRESS RELEASE May 10, 2018 Page 4 First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Selected Financial Data Summary of Operations Data Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Rental income from medical services $ 5,305,000 $ 4,914,000 Costs of revenue 3,099,000 2,568,000 Gross margin 2,206,000 2,346,000 Selling & administrative expense 986,000 1,139,000 Interest expense 425,000 453,000 Operating income 795,000 754,000 Interest & other income 5,000 4,000 Income before income taxes 800,000 758,000 Income tax expense 150,000 216,000 Net income 650,000 542,000 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interest (260,000\n)\n(249,000\n)\nNet income attributable to American Shared Hospital Services\n$ 390,000 $ 293,000 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.07 $ 0.05 Assuming dilution $ 0.07 $ 0.05 Balance Sheet Data\nMar. 31, Dec. 31, 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,751,000 $ 2,152,000 Current assets $ 9,947,000 $ 8,893,000 Total assets $ 58,031,000 $ 58,176,000 Current liabilities $ 9,497,000 $ 9,007,000 Shareholders' equity $ 30,590,000 $ 29,885,000 AMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES\nPRESS RELEASE\nMay 10, 2018\nPage 5\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAdjusted EBITDA Three months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet Income\n$\n390,000\n$\n293,000\nPlus:\nIncome tax expense\n150,000\n216,000\nInterest expense\n425,000\n453,000\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n1,657,000\n1,604,000\nStock-based compensation expense\n55,000\n50,000\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,677,000\n$\n2,616,000\nAMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES PRESS RELEASE\nMay 10, 2018\nPage 6\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNon-GAAP Pre-Tax Income\nThree Months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n800,000\n$\n758,000\nLess: Net (income) attributable to non-controlling interest\n(260,000\n)\n(249,000\n)\nNon-GAAP pre-tax income\n$\n540,000\n$\n509,000\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005310/en/\nAmerican Shared Hospital Services\nErnest A.
