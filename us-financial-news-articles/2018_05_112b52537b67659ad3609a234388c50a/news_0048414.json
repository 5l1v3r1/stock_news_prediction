(NASDAQ:INO) today announced that it has bolstered its efforts to attract partnerships and collaborations and increase non-dilutive funding with the hiring of an accomplished business development leader and the promotion of a key R&D leader.\nMr. Shawn D. Bridy joins Inovio as Vice President of Business Development reporting to Dr. J. Joseph Kim, President & CEO. Mr. Bridy has more than 20 years of business development & licensing, commercial strategy, and transaction experience in the life sciences industry. He previously held strategic business development roles at large pharma companies and smaller biotechs including GSK, Elan, BTG plc and Immunome. Most recently he was Managing Director of Bridy Advisors, a top-tier strategic and operational advisory company. Mr. Bridy has an MA in Biology and an MBA in Finance from Villanova University.\nInovio has also promoted Dr. Kate E. Broderick, Ph.D., to Vice President, Preclinical Research & Development reporting to Dr. Laurent Humeau, Senior Vice President, R&D. In her new position, Dr. Broderick will continue to spearhead Inovio’s efforts to secure non-dilutive strategic R&D funding opportunities to support the research and clinical testing of Inovio’s candidate vaccines. Dr. Broderick has previously led Inovio’s efforts to receive numerous grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense as well from other government and non-governmental organizations. She recently led Inovio’s efforts to secure a $56 million funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to evaluate DNA vaccine candidates for Lassa fever and MERS through Phase 2 clinical testing. She will also be responsible for the oversight of a diverse preclinical R&D team encompassing discovery and development research, as well as operations, research DNA manufacturing and next-generation device development. She earned her Ph.D. at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\nDr. Broderick recently participated in World Health Organization (WHO) advisory panel in Geneva on “Product Development & Programmatic Considerations for Nucleic Acid-based Vaccines,” where she highlighted Inovio’s emerging infectious disease vaccine portfolio, which includes the company’s vaccine for Ebola.\nDr. J. Joseph Kim, Inovio’s President & CEO, said, “While we have a strong record of performance in attracting commercial partners such as MedImmune/AstraZeneca, Genentech/Roche and Regeneron and have secured significant non-dilutive funding in the past several years, hiring and promoting these two business and scientific leaders will accelerate and expand those efforts going forward. Kate and Shawn will play important roles in the growth of Inovio as we partner assets and secure funding to support the advancement of Inovio’s immunotherapies and vaccines.”\nAbout Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nInovio is a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of DNA immunotherapies that transform the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.
