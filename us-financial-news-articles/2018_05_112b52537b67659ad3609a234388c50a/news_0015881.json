Others are preparing to set up 60 massive tents across the country to serve the iftar meals that follow dawn-to-dusk fasting during Ramadan.\n“We are giving out the largest box in Egypt,” said Sherif Azzouz, head of the volunteer network at Misr El Kheir, one of the charities involved.\nEach box weighs 25 kg (55 lbs) and contains 16 products, including rice, pasta, ghee, sugar, flour, orzo, wheat and tea.

They include sugar, oil, rice and pasta.\nRamadan is expected to start in Egypt on May 17 this year. The first day of the holy month often varies from country to country, depending on lunar sightings.
