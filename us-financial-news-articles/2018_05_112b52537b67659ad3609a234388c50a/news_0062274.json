REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian Macri’s cabinet chief, Marcos Pena, told reporters that Macri rejected the measure as soon as it reached his desk.\n“Argentina has to make a more of an effort to get closer to having a balanced budget,” Pena said. “The law that limits utility price increases is vetoed.”\nMacri, elected in 2015 on a pro-investment platform, has cut utility subsidies, forcing Argentines to pay higher monthly bills. His fiscal belt-tightening program has not gone down well with members of the Peronist opposition, particularly those allied with the country’s previous leader, Cristina Fernandez.\nReporting by Maximiliano Rizzi and Hernan Nessi; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
