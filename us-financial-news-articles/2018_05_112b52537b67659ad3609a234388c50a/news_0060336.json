Exosomes have the potential to target any cell in the body and as proved in ArunA’s studies are capable of multiple administrations via IV and of crossing the blood brain barrier non-invasively to reach the site of injury. Exosomes have shown great promise as potential therapeutics and as vehicles to carry drug payloads to the site of injury or disease.\nAbout ArunA Biomedical\nAt ArunA Biomedical, we are the experts in the design and scaling of neural-derived exosomes, developing a new class of cell-free biologics and cell-mediated drug targeting systems to treat CNS and neurodegenerative disorders. www.arunabio.com\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180531005473/en/\nFor ArunA Biomedical\nLauren Arnold, 781-235-3060\nlarnold@macbiocom.com\nSource: ArunA Biomedical", "external_links": ["https://www.arunabio.com/board-of-directors", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arunabiomedical.com%2F&esheet=51814993&newsitemid=20180531005473&lan=en-US&anchor=ArunA+Biomedical&index=1&md5=9bc3647b4480a44e5337b1c44ee45728", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arunabiomedical.com%2Fboard-of-directors%2F&esheet=51814993&newsitemid=20180531005473&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arunabio.com%2Fboard-of-directors&index=2&md5=14f79875e327d385f744366125e1064f", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180531005473/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arunabio.com&esheet=51814993&newsitemid=20180531005473&lan=en-US&anchor=www.arunabio.com&index=3&md5=1fb05c911f2c2f55334d2101d08651e2"], "published": "2018-05-31T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:29:06.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
