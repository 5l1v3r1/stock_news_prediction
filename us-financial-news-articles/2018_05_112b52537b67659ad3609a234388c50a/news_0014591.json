REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\nAfter three opening days in Israel and a rest day, the Giro finally reached Italian soil, with Wellens tipped as a favourite for the day’s stage.\nThe Lotto-Soudal rider was on the right end of a late split and he sustained his effort on an 800-metre climb up an average gradient of almost 10 percent to the finish line.\nHe beat Canada’s Michael Woods, who was seconds ahead of Italian Enrico Bataglin.\nFour-time Tour de France champion Froome, who is under investigation for a failed dope test in last year’s Vuelta, struggled in the finale and lost some 20 seconds, according to provisional results.\nAustralian Rohan Dennis retained the overall leader’s pink jersey with a one-second advantage over defending champion Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands.\nPortgual’s Jose Goncalves, one of the overall contenders, suffered a couple of mechanical problems in the finale and dropped out of the top 10.
