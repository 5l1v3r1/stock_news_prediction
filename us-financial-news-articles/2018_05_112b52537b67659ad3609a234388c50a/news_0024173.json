It demanded that Xiaomi compensate it for losses due to the alleged infringement, though Zhang declined to give a figure.\nIn a statement, Xiaomi said it has requested patent authorities to invalidate patent rights that are the subject of the lawsuit filed in Shenzhen. It said it will fully cooperate in the investigation by authorities on the matter.\nCoolpad, a Shenzhen-based smartphone maker founded 25 years ago, was once a unit of Jia Yueting's LeEco conglomerate, which has been struggling financially over the past year and a half. LeEco sold off all its interest in Coolpad in January.\nCoolpad shares have been suspended since March 2017. It has been unable to report its 2017 annual result on time and only just filed its 2016 annual report last month after repeated delays due to audit problems. It reported a loss of HK$4.38 billion for 2016 versus a profit of HK$2.32 billion in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:47:06.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
