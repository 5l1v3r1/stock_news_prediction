Revenue from the unit fell 3 percent in the six months to the end of March.\nUnderlying growth from its website MailOnline was more than offset by decreasing circulation revenues, down 6 percent, and declines in print advertising, down 3 percent.\nAt the group level it reported six-month underlying revenue up 1 percent to 746 million pounds and flat operating profit at 84 million pounds.\nDaily Mail received a boost earlier this month when it said it would receive a 642 million pound windfall from the sale of ZPG, the owner of online property portals Zoopla and PrimeLocation to private equity group Silver Lake.\n“Most recently, the expected disposal of our stake in ZPG Plc is a clear demonstration of our long-term approach to value creation,” Chief Executive Paul Zwillenberg said.\n“As a result of this portfolio activity, our balance sheet will be strengthened considerably, enhancing our financial flexibility for balanced capital allocation.” Reporting by Kate Holton, Editing by Paul Sandle", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T10:06:50.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
