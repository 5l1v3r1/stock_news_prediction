Trump wants to hold it by late May or early June.\n“We’re looking at various countries, including Singapore. And we are also talking about the possibility of the DMZ Peace House/Freedom House,” Trump said.\nTrump said the Peace House carried symbolic value that having the summit in a third country would not have. The president tried to visit the DMZ last November during a trip to Seoul, but dense fog forced his helicopter to turn back.\nSome U.S. officials have argued privately that having the summit in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas would present the unwelcome appearance of Trump traveling to Kim instead of the two of them meeting at a neutral site.\nBut officials have also debated how far Kim would be able to travel.\n“I think that some people maybe don’t like the look of that,” Trump said of the idea of a DMZ summit. “And some people like it very much.”\nHe said he had raised the idea with Moon, days after dramatic images of Moon meeting Kim at the Peace House dominated the news.\n“There’s something that I like about it because you’re there,” he said. “You’re actually there, where if things work out, there’s a great celebration to be had on the site.”\nBuoying prospects for the Trump-Kim summit was a North Korean announcement on Sunday that it would close its main nuclear test site next month.\nBut many U.S. officials are doubtful that Kim will actually agree to give up nuclear weapons after working so long to develop them.\nTrump said the North Korean decision to close the test site, along with its suspensions of nuclear and ballistic missile tests, were hopeful signs.\nBut he said North Korea had “to get rid of the nuclear weapons” for peace efforts to be a success.\nTrump, who has declined to comment on whether he has spoken directly to the North Korean leader, called Kim “very open and very straightforward so far.”\n“Oh yeah, I think the summit’s going to happen,” he said. They very much want it. We certainly would like to see it. ... I will say this: If it’s not a success. ... I will respectfully leave. It’s very simple.”\nReporting by Steve Hlland; Additional reporting by Makini Brice and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Alistair Bell and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T00:03:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
