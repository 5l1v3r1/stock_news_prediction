(TSXV:REZ) (Frankfurt:REZ) (OTCBB:REZZF) (“the Company” or “RedZone”) is pleased to announce that it has satisfied all the conditions under its previously announced option agreement, (see Aug 2 nd 2016 press release) relating to the acquisition of 14 lode claims, located in Arizona (“the Option Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement, Redzone has issued 100,000 shares (four month hold) to the previous claim holders such that its newly formed subsidiary, Arizona Lithium Resources Ltd., now holds all of its previously optioned Arizona property claims. The claim total now stands at 236 and covers 4,876 acres.\nThe Company is waiting on its “Notice of Intent to Disturb” permit which will allow it to begin the trenching of nineteen (19) areas, to a depth of 20 feet, that were identified as high priority targets during the chip sampling program conducted earlier this year. The expectation is that the results of this trenching program will result in the identification of drill targets for the next stage of exploration, which is targeted for this summer. All the requirements for the trenching permit have been submitted and the company expects the permit to be issued soon.\nIn addition, metallurgical samples will be taken to start determining the material’s amenability to processing.\nAbout RedZone\nRedZone is a mineral exploration company with a focus on metals that make up and support the rapid evolution to battery power.
