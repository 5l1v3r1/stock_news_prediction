(NASDAQ:EYPT), a specialty biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative ophthalmic products, today announced the appointment of Leonard M. Blum as Executive Vice President and General Manager, U.S., effective May 14, 2018. In this role, he will be responsible for the launch of DEXYCU™ (dexamethasone intraocular suspension) 9%, the Company’s U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product for the treatment of postoperative inflammation, and, subject to FDA approval, YUTIQ™ (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis, which has an FDA action date of November 5, 2018. DEXYCU and, if approved, YUTIQ, are expected to launch in the first half of 2019. Mr. Blum will assume responsibility for all of the Company’s sales, marketing, payor access and trade efforts, as well as the Company’s business developments efforts.\nMr. Blum brings to EyePoint more than 30 years of successful executive and management experience, most recently serving as Chief Business and Commercial Officer of Omeros Corporation, where he oversaw sales and marketing efforts for OMIDRIA®, a product used by ophthalmologists in conjunction with cataract surgery and intraocular lens replacement to maintain pupil size and reduce postoperative pain. Prior to joining Omeros in 2016, he served as Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer at Theravance, Inc., a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, and its spin-off company, Theravance BioPharma, from 2007 until 2016. In this capacity, he collaborated with Astellas Pharma in the launch of VIBATIV®, a drug for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and soft structure infections, and with Glaxo SmithKline in the launches of BREO® and ANORO®, two combination therapies for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Prior to that, Mr. Blum founded and led the commercial functions at ICOS Corporation, a biotechnology company, progressing from Vice President, Marketing to Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing, from 2000 until the company’s acquisition by Eli Lilly and Company in 2007. At ICOS, he was responsible for the launch and commercialization of CIALIS®, which is the worldwide top selling treatment for erectile dysfunction.\nMr. Blum began his career in the pharmaceutical industry at Merck & Co., where he spent thirteen years in positions of increasing responsibility in marketing and business unit leadership in the U.S. and Europe. Over these years, Mr. Blum was responsible for more than a dozen product launches in several therapeutic categories and markets.\nMr. Blum earned his A.B. in Economics, magna cum laude , at Princeton University, studied International Finance on a Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Zurich and completed an M.B.A. at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. Before entering the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Blum served as an officer in the U.S. Army Special Forces, and completed his military service at the rank of Captain.\n“It is a pleasure to welcome Leonard to EyePoint Pharmaceuticals at such an exciting juncture for the Company,” said Nancy Lurker, President and Chief Executive Officer of EyePoint Pharmaceuticals. “His extensive experience with the successful launches of multiple products across a range of therapeutic categories will be invaluable as we continue to lay the groundwork for the U.S commercialization of both DEXYCU and, subject to FDA approval, YUTIQ, in the first half of 2019. We look forward to his insights and expertise as we continue our planned transformation into a sustainable ophthalmology growth company.”\n“With the recent acquisition of Icon Bioscience, Inc. and its U.S. FDA-approved product, DEXYCU, and a pending new drug application for YUTIQ, EyePoint has the potential to establish itself as an innovative leader in the ophthalmic therapeutic market,” said Mr. Blum. “I look forward to working with the rest of the EyePoint team to ensure the Company’s successful transition into a commercial entity.”\nInducement Grants under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4)\nIn connection with the hiring of Mr. Blum, the Company today reported the grant of inducement awards.

(formerly pSivida Corp.) ( www.eyepointpharma.com ), headquartered in Watertown, MA, is a specialty biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative ophthalmic products in indications with high unmet medical need to help improve the lives of patients with serious eye disorders. The Company has developed three of only four FDA-approved sustained-release treatments for back-of-the-eye diseases. In addition, DEXYCU™ was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 9, 2018. DEXYCU, administered as a single intraocular dose at the end of ocular surgery for the treatment of postoperative inflammation, is the first and only FDA-approved intraocular product with this indication. DEXYCU employs EyePoint’s Verisome™ extended-release drug delivery technology, which encompasses a broad number of related but distinct drug delivery systems capable of incorporating an extensive range of active agents, including small molecules, proteins and monoclonal antibodies. ILUVIEN® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant), a micro-insert for diabetic macular edema, licensed to Alimera Sciences, is currently sold directly in the U.S. and several EU countries. Retisert® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant), for posterior uveitis, is licensed to and sold by Bausch & Lomb. The New Drug Application (NDA) for EyePoint’s lead product candidate, YUTIQ™ for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye, has been accepted for filing by the FDA and is currently under standard review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of November 5, 2018. The Company's pre-clinical development program is focused on using its core Durasert™ and Verisome™ platform technologies to deliver drugs to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other diseases.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Increase in Intraocular Pressure - Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Delayed Healing - The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. Exacerbation of Infection - The use of DEXYCU, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is not recommended in the presence of most active viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal disease of ocular structures. Use of a corticosteroid in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires caution and may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to coincidentally develop with long-term local steroid application and must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal culture should be taken when appropriate. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Cataract Progression – The use of corticosteroids in phakic individuals may promote the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts. ADVERSE REACTIONS - The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurred in 5-15% of subjects and included increases in intraocular pressure, corneal edema and iritis.
