Attempts by Reuters to reach him were unsuccessful.\nHis parents said they have tried to get their son to leave their home in Camillus, near Syracuse, for several months, according to court filings. The documents included five written notices that the couple said they began sending him on Feb. 2.\n“After a discussion with your mother, we have decided you must leave this house immediately,” the couple wrote in one of the letters. “You have 14 days to vacate. You will not be allowed to return.”\nIn another note, the parents offered him $1,100 to help look for a job and an apartment and shared advice on how to manage on his own.\n“There are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you. Get one — you have to work!” one of the letters read. In the second-to-last letter, on March 5, the parents warned they would take actions to make sure he left the home.\nThe judge also asked for adult protective services because he is concerned about the strained relationship, according to WSTM. Michael Rotondo said he plans to appeal the ruling.\nReporting by Gina Cherelus; Editing by Scott Malone and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:54:30.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
