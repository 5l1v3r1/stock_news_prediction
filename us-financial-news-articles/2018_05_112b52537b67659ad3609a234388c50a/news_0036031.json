It is the best performing LME metal this year with gains of about 15 percent, but Commerzbank was cautious about further gains due to an extended net long speculative position.\n“A price correction would thus come as no surprise, especially as the Beijing-based metals analytical firm Antaike envisages demand growth of only 3.5 percent in China this year,” the German bank said in a note.\n* BULL CYCLE: Metals markets are moving into a new bull cycle that will be longer and shallower than the last, driven by rising inflation and dispersed demand growth, panelists said at the LME week Asia conference in Hong Kong.\n* PRICES: Zinc was bid down 0.4 percent to $3,062 a tonne in official rings; lead edged down 0.04 percent to trade at $2,340; and tin traded down 0.8 percent at $20,555.\nAdditional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr. in Manila; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl"], "published": "2018-05-17T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:42:00.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
