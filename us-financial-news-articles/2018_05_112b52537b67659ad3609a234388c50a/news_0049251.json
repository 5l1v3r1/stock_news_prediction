REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nThe rule changes would move the oversight of commercial firearm exports from the U.S. Department of State to the Department of Commerce.\nThe action is part of a broader Trump administration overhaul of weapons export policy that was announced in April.\nTiming for the formal publication of the rule change and the opening of the public comment period was unveiled by Mike Miller the acting secretary for the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, the State Department’s body that currently oversees the bulk of commercial firearms transfers and other foreign military sales. He was speaking at the Forum on the Arms Trade’s annual conference at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.\nReuters first reported on the proposed rule changes in September as the Trump administration was preparing to make it easier for American gun makers to sell small arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign buyers.\nDomestic gun sales have fallen significantly after soaring under President Barack Obama, when gun enthusiasts stockpiled weapons and ammunition out of fear that the government would tighten gun laws.\nA move by the Trump administration to make it simpler to sell small arms abroad may generate business for gun makers American Outdoor Brands ( AOBC.O ) and Sturm Ruger & Company ( RGR.N ) in an industry experiencing a deep sales slump since the election of President Donald Trump.\nRemington, America’s oldest gun maker, filed for bankruptcy protection in March, weeks after a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people and triggered intensified campaigns for gun control by activists. Remington emerged from bankruptcy last week.\nThe expected relaxing of rules could increase foreign gun sales by as much as 20 percent, the National Sports Shooting Foundation has estimated. As well as the industry’s big players, it may also help small gunsmiths and specialists who are currently required to pay an annual federal fee to export relatively minor amounts of products.
