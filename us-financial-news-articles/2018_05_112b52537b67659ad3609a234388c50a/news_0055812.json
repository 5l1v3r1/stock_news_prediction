This is a reflection of the excellent work he has done over the last few months at the institution,” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan told reporters.\nEskom has not had a permanent CEO since Brian Molefe resigned in November 2016 after a report linked him to the Gupta family, whose relationship with Zuma is the subject of a South African judicial inquiry into state corruption.\nThe Guptas and Zuma deny wrongdoing.\nUnder Hadebe’s watch as interim CEO, Eskom averted a liquidity crisis by securing billions of rand in emergency funding from banks.\nHadebe is the former head of investment banking at Barclays Africa and before that was CEO of Land Bank.\nDespite a shortage of coal at some power stations, Hadebe said this month that there would be no power blackouts this year.\nHadebe has said he aims to deliver a turnaround strategy for Eskom by September which could include the disposal of some assets.
