They are to be applied,” Issoze-Ngondet said on national television after the ruling.\nRichard August Onouviet, the president of the National Assembly, also said he accepted the court’s decision.\nThe court ordered President Ali Bongo to name an interim prime minister until elections could be organised. A multi-party committee appointed an electoral commission last Friday after repeated delays to organise the vote but no new election date has yet been set.\nThe upper house of parliament, the Senate, will remain in place under the court’s order.\nBongo appointed Issoze-Ngondet prime minister after a narrow victory in a 2016 election that international observers said was marred by irregularities and that sparked brief spasms of violence.
