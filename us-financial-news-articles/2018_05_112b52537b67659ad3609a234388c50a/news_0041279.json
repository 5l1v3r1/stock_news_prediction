If you pay an extra $25 a month:\nYou'll pay off your student loan one year earlier and save $1,417.61 in interest. To get a more specific picture, Sallie Mae's accrued interest calculator can help estimate how much you can save depending on your loan balance and interest rate. Other lenders have similar tools.\nBut you don't need to make an extra payment every single month to make a difference — you can do it every once in a while, or whenever your budget allows (think of applying birthday cash or bonuses).\nAnd before beefing up a payment, make sure you understand the type of loan and your repayment options . You should also specify that those extra funds get applied to the principal of the loan and not to future interest payments. (However, if you have unpaid fees, the money must be applied there first.)\nFinally, make those payments automatic. An automatic-payment program will decrease your chances of missing a month and may come with the added perk of an interest rate deduction on your loan — further decreasing your liability in the long run.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nCrowdfunding, volunteering, trivia — and other unexpected ways to wipe out your student debt\nFor some, student loan debt is doubling, tripling, and even quadrupling\nThese are the ways student loans stop people from buying a house", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:18:57.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
