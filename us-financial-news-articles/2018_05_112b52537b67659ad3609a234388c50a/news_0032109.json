Picture taken January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt Hans-Georg Maassen told reporters that the European Union was working hard to increase transparency on social media platforms and to raise consciousness among those companies.\n“The Commission is in negotiations, but if this consciousness doesn’t help, then we may have to adopt regulations,” Maassen said.\nAndrew Parker, head of Britain’s MI5 spy agency, said there had already been a shift among the companies that operate such platforms, but more work was needed.\n“We do not accept that the internet is some sort of ‘Wild West’ where no moral values can apply,” he told reporters.\nOn the internet, as in the real world, he said, people were entitled to protection from “the worst and darkest forms of human behaviour at the edges of human society. Those companies know that and want to do something about it”.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Douglas Busvine\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:17:51.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
