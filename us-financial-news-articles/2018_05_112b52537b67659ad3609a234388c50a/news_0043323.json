The other day he played 15 minutes in South Africa for contractual reasons but tomorrow the plan is for him to rest.”\nMessi has played 53 games for the Catalans this season in all competitions, topping the league’s scoring charts with 34 goals, and he will lead Argentina’s challenge at next month’s World Cup.
