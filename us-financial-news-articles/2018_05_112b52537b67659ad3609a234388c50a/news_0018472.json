Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to avoid such bans, calling instead for tailored solutions to bring down car emissions in heavily polluted cities.\nThe states of Bavaria and also Lower Saxony, home to Germany’s biggest car manufacturers, want to introduce incentives or tax breaks to encourage car owners to retrofit vehicles.\nLower Saxony, home to Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, suggested vehicle owners should receive up to 2,000 euros in incentives and tax breaks to fund retrofits, the cost of which should be borne by manufacturers and the federal government.\nGermany’s finance ministry has shown no willingness to subsidize such incentives.\nThe German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. diesel exhaust tests.\nOn Tuesday, Germany’s transport ministry said Audi, a premium brand owned by Volkswagen, faced another investigation of 30,000 vehicles suspected of being fitted with illegal software.\n($1 = 0.8425 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:11:28.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
