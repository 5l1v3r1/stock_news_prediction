In 2015 she founded Daré Bioscience with the distinct mission to advance to market innovative therapeutics that clearly address unmet needs in women’s health, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health, and fertility.\nThe company has two potential first-in-class product candidates in clinical development: Ovaprene®, a non-hormonal, monthly contraceptive vaginal ring and Topical Sildenafil (SST-6007), a potential treatment for female sexual arousal disorder utilizing the same active ingredient as Viagra ® . The company received a funding award to further the development of Ovaprene from the National Institutes of Health Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and recently initiated a post-coital test clinical trial for Ovaprene.\nIn addition to its lead programs, Daré is building a portfolio of innovative women’s health products. In 2018, the company licensed an intravaginal ring technology platform from Juniper Pharmaceuticals, including three pre-clinical candidates using the technology, and entered into an agreement with Pear Tree Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to acquire a potential treatment for vulvar and vaginal atrophy in patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Sabrina has been instrumental in guiding the company to identify, qualify and advance new product candidates for clear unmet needs, and employ a flexible, effective partnering strategy that leaves the option for in-licensing, out-licensing, as well as future potential collaborations.\nFor more information on Sabrina and Daré’s growing portfolio of unique women’s health product candidates, please visit www.darebioscience.com .\nAbout Daré Bioscience\nDaré Bioscience is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s reproductive and sexual health.
