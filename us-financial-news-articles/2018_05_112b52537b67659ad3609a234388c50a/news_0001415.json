All amounts are in Canadian dollars and reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) unless otherwise noted.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Telesat reported consolidated revenues of $232 million, compared to $235 million in the same period in 2017. During the quarter, the U.S. dollar was approximately 5% weaker against the Canadian dollar than it was during the first quarter of 2016 and, as a result, there was an unfavorable impact on the conversion of U.S. dollar denominated revenues. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, revenue increased by 2% ($4 million) compared to the same period in 2017.\nOperating expenses of $38 million for the quarter were 31% ($17 million) lower than the same period in 2017, or 29% ($16 million) lower excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense arising from a special payment of $12 million made during the first quarter of 2017 to stock option holders in connection with a return of capital to Telesat’s shareholders. Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the quarter was $195 million, an increase of 1% ($3 million) compared to the same period in 2017 and an increase of 4% ($8 million) when adjusted for foreign exchange rate changes. The Adjusted EBITDA margin 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was 83.9%, compared to 81.9% in the same period in 2017.\nOn January 1, 2018, Telesat adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the adoption of IFRS 15 had a net positive impact of approximately $4 million on revenues, a reduction of approximately $5 million on operating expenses and a positive impact of approximately $9 million on Adjusted EBITDA 1 . The adoption of IFRS 9 had no impact on revenues, operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA 1 .\nTelesat’s net loss for the quarter was $15 million compared to net income of $88 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The $103 million difference was the result of a higher non-cash loss on foreign exchange arising principally from the translation of Telesat’s U.S. dollar denominated debt into Canadian dollars in the first quarter of 2018.\n“I am pleased with our performance for the first quarter,” commented Dan Goldberg, Telesat’s President and CEO. “Our results underscore the stability of our business, underpinned by our substantial contractual backlog, as well as our strong operating discipline. Beyond the financial results, we continue to make progress on our planned Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites, which we anticipate will launch mid this year. In addition, we successfully launched and deployed our first Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite to support the development of our planned state-of-the-art, high capacity LEO constellation that will deliver transformative, low latency, fiber-like broadband to commercial and government users worldwide. Looking ahead, we remain focused on increasing the utilization of our in-orbit satellites and executing on our key growth initiatives.”\nBusiness Highlights\nAt March 31, 2018:\nTelesat had contracted backlog 2 for future services of approximately $4.0 billion.\nFleet utilization was 93% for Telesat’s North American fleet and 70% for Telesat’s international fleet.\nIn January 2018, Telesat announced the successful launch of its first LEO satellite, an important milestone in the company’s plans to deploy a global LEO constellation. Telesat’s LEO constellation is expected to deliver high-performing, cost-effective, fiber-like broadband anywhere in the world for business, government and individual users. Telesat subsequently announced that OmniAccess and Optus Satellite would begin testing and trials on Phase 1 LEO.\nIn February 2018, Telesat welcomed the Government of Canada’s commitment in Budget 2018 to support investment in new LEO satellite constellations for rural broadband communications. Budget 2018 proposes funding of $100 million over five years for the Strategic Innovation Fund, with a particular focus on supporting projects that relate to LEO satellites and next generation rural broadband.\nIn March 2018, Telesat welcomed the Government of Ontario’s Budget 2018 commitment to support an investment of up to $20 million towards Telesat’s LEO satellite constellation.\nIn April 2018, Telesat entered into amended Senior Secured Credit Facilities which reduced the applicable margin from 3.0% to 2.5% on the outstanding borrowings of US $2,344 million.\nTelesat’s report on Form 6-K for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, has been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and may be accessed on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nConference Call\nTelesat has scheduled a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. ET to discuss its financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 and other recent developments.

11,865 Non-cash expense related to share-based compensation 382 899 Adjusted EBITDA $ 194,903 $ 192,235 Revenue $ 232,354 $ 234,669 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 83.9 % 81.9 % End Notes\n1 The common definition of EBITDA is “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.” In evaluating financial performance, Telesat uses revenue and deducts certain operating expenses (including share-based compensation expense and unusual and non-recurring items, including restructuring related expenses) to obtain operating income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenue) as measures of Telesat’s operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA allows Telesat and investors to compare Telesat’s operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization, interest and investment income, interest expense, taxes and certain other expenses. Financial results of competitors in the satellite services industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures, the amount of intangible assets recorded, the differences in assets’ lives, the timing and amount of investments, the effects of other income (expense), and unusual and non-recurring items. The use of Adjusted EBITDA assists Telesat and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items. Competitors in the satellite services industry have significantly different capital structures. Telesat believes the use of Adjusted EBITDA improves comparability of performance by excluding interest expense.\nTelesat believes the use of Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin along with IFRS financial measures enhances the understanding of Telesat’s operating results and is useful to Telesat and investors in comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDA as used here may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by competitors. Adjusted EBITDA should be used in conjunction with IFRS financial measures and is not presented as a substitute for cash flows from operations as a measure of Telesat’s liquidity or as a substitute for net income as an indicator of Telesat’s operating performance.\n2 Contracted revenue backlog (‘‘backlog’’) represents Telesat’s expected future revenue from existing service contracts (without discounting for present value) including any deferred revenue that Telesat will recognize in the future in respect of cash already received. The calculation of the backlog reflects the revenue recognition policies adopted under IFRS 15. The majority of Telesat’s contracted revenue backlog is generated from contractual agreements for satellite capacity. Backlog is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS. The presentation of backlog is not comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations of backlog. Telesat believes the disclosure of the recognition of backlog provides information that is useful to an investor’s understanding of its expected known revenue recognition.\n3 Includes severance payments and special compensation and benefits for executives and employees.\nSource: Telesat Canada", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7-18X90KA-3zcDyeX7882eCeUPx9rJNk7Ph-cpbYE0nVN4eqzwbRBQWUbwT7C65i0lMckl2deggmwqgNkn7Rgw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2qB0AFUvZD2sow-CLPFbr0phzrGiSXdOdU5X7wJNvEuI3Jcdws0_E3Ks1c4TNcd1hxMMhSIZdPQ98gQ60f2ZlQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=epj65CJc_B1k-t1_NQmVB-4PBLx1vHG1vXccwderqh6aJNHIiu9VSs13Ztjxhdkt64v8veZEPbve1iul3Nkqaw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Kbh1prLtISJoEsADAu_A67WGbPd7fFbVP3Rorjf_UBuOJ8KJZ9ISjE7zBlbEAyFbwR1Eh4iYb8Zr7_ldIcj9Yg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1836f89e-1ac3-4ef6-af72-e5220766385f"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:55:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
