Reuters Good morning. The U.S. Justice Department took action against “piling on” in corporate enforcement, seeking to disrupt a tendency for regulators to impose multiple penalties on companies over the same conduct, reports Risk & Compliance Journal . Lawyers welcomed the move, unveiled Wednesday by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n“This sounds like a positive step because the problem Mr. Rosenstein identified is a real one, that companies can face penalties and other sanctions from a variety of government agencies and regulators around the world,” said Harry Sandick, a white-collar attorney at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP. “In some cases it appears the penalties are really duplicative.”\nThe policy , which Mr. Rosenstein said will guide the department’s decisions, reminds prosecutors they can’t use the threat of criminal prosecution to pressure a company to pay a bigger penalty in a civil case. It tells department attorneys to coordinate the penalties they impose on firms to avoid “disproportionate punishment” and to work with other agencies—and authorities abroad—dealing with cases involving the same misconduct.\nThe emphasis on international cooperation is a key point, said Nathaniel Edmonds, a former assistant chief of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit in the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section. “Companies are more likely to get a global resolution in these types of cases,” to the extent regulators cooperate internationally, he said.\nThe alternative for a company can be to be stuck trying to satisfy conflicting demands by regulators in more than one country, he said. “A company never wants to be caught in the middle,” he said. Mr. Edmonds focuses on global internal investigations and multijurisdictional enforcement issues at Paul Hastings LLP.\nA fourth part of the policy—a list of the factors the Justice Department considers in deciding whether multiple penalties are appropriate in a given case—offers potential benefits for companies, Mr. Sandick said. The areas cited include how serious the wrongdoing was, whether the law requires certain penalties, the risk of a delay in reaching a settlement and how cooperative the company was in disclosing an issue and cooperating with the department.\nThe policy isn’t legally binding on the Justice Department but a defense lawyer could still argue that past cooperation should result in a lesser penalty, Mr. Sandick said.\nDouglas Tween, who heads the U.S. government-enforcement and cartels practice at U.K. law firm Linklaters LLP, said the speech seems to codify a welcome shift that was already under way.\nThe department in the last few years has been more sensitive to the issue of piling on than in the past and has been willing to work with other agencies in the U.S. and abroad to reach fair resolutions, he said.\nStill, he said, challenges remain. “In practice it can be very difficult to make this kind of coordination work,” Mr. Tween said. “Different enforcers work at different speeds and the DOJ will not always be willing to wait years for other enforcers to finish their investigations.”\nCOMPLIANCE\nRBS reaches settlement deal with U.S. Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC has agreed to pay $4.9 billion to settle with the U.S. Justice Department over the sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the global financial crisis, clearing the path for the bank’s privatization, the WSJ reports.\nRoyal Bank of Scotland announced a settlement agreement with the Justice Department on Wednesday.
