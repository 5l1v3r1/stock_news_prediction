Sirotkin retired from that race after a first lap collision and has a three place grid penalty for Sunday’s race at the Circuit de Catalunya.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:23:35.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
