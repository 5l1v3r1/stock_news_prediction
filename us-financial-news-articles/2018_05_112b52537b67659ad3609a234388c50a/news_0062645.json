For the month, it declined 1.9 percent.\nTurnover was 2.3 billion rupees ($14.54 million), more than twice of this year’s daily average of 998 million rupees.\n“There was foreign selling on JKH (John Keells Holdings). With the dip in the share price, the All Share Price (Index) also came down,” said Hussain Gani, deputy CEO at Softlogic Stockbrokers.\n“There were some month-end settlements also.”\nA weaker rupee, political uncertainty and the recent fuel price hike also weighed on sentiment, with local investors mostly keeping to the sidelines awaiting cues about the real impact of the floods that hit the island nation over the past week, brokers said.\nAnalysts said investors are waiting to see the full impact of the floods, which killed 24 people last week.\nShares of John Keells fell 2.3 percent, Melstacrop Plc ended 3.5 percent weaker, Richard Pieris & Company Plc lost 4.7 percent and Lion Brewery (Ceylon) Plc slipped 2.5 percent.\nThe rupee hit a fresh low of 158.50 per dollar on May 16 on importer demand for the U.S. currency.\nAnalysts said market sentiment had been dented by concerns over political instability following President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to suspend parliament last month after 16 legislators from his ruling coalition defected.\nOn May 8, Sirisena urged his own coalition government and the opposition to end a power struggle to achieve ambitious goals including anti-corruption measures.
