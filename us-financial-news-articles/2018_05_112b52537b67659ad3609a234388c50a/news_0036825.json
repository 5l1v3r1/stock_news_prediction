REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\nThe agreement is aimed at making tax avoidance easier to detect and comes as Airbnb, like its taxi-hailing peer Uber, faces growing pressure from regulators worldwide.\nAs part of the agreement, which is still to be passed by the Danish parliament, the number of days an owner may list a property is limited to 70 per year. It also includes a tax-free allowance of up to 40,000 Danish crowns ($6,350) annually.\n“We want a flourishing sharing economy in Denmark where it is possible for renters to earn a reasonable tax-free amount on making their property available,” said the Danish tax minister Karsten Lauritzen.
