Silver earned from royalty and stream agreements was converted to gold equivalent ounces by multiplying the silver ounces by the average silver price for the period and dividing by the average gold price for the period. Diamonds, other metals and cash royalties were converted into gold equivalent ounces by dividing the associated revenue by the average gold price for the period. Offtake agreements were converted using the financial settlement equivalent divided by the average gold price for the period.\nAverage Metal Prices and Exchange Rate\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Gold (1) $1,329 $1,219 Silver (2) $17 $17 Exchange rate (US$/Can$) (3) 1.2647 1.3238 (1) The London Bullion Market Association’s pm price in U.S. dollars (2) The London Bullion Market Association’s price in U.S. dollars (3) Bank of Canada daily rate (2) Cash operating margin, which represents revenues less cost of sales, is not a recognized measure under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The Company believes that this non-IFRS generally accepted industry measure provides a realistic indication of operating performance and provides a useful comparison with its peers. The following table reconciles the cash margin to the revenues and cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of income and related notes:\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018 2017 $ $ Revenues 125,614 17,126 Less: Revenues from offtake interests (93,029 ) - Revenues from royalty and stream interests 32,585 17,126 Cost of sales (93,667 ) (102 ) Less: Cost of sales of offtake interests (90,604 ) - Cost of sales of royalty and stream interests (3,063 ) (102 ) Revenues from royalty and stream interests 32,585 17,126 Less: Cost of sales of royalty and stream interests (3,063 ) (102 ) Cash margin from royalty and stream interests 29,522 17,024 91 % 99 % Revenues from offtake interests 93,029 - Less: Cost of sales of offtake interests (90,604 ) - Cash margin from offtake interests 2,425 - 3 % - (3) The cash gain or loss is calculated by subtracting the cash cost from the cash proceeds on the sale of an investment.

All statements in this release, other than statements of historical fact, that address future events, developments or performance that Osisko expects to occur including management’s expectations regarding Osisko’s growth, results of operations, estimated future revenue, requirements for additional capital, production estimates, production costs and revenue, business prospects and opportunities are forward-looking statements. In addition, statements relating to gold equivalent ounces (\"GEOs\") are forward‑looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that the GEOs will be realized. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words \"expects\", \"is expected\" \"plans\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"potential\", \"scheduled\" and similar expressions or variations (including negative variations of such words and phrases), or may be identified by statements to the effect that certain actions, events or conditions \"will\", \"would\", \"may\", \"could\" or \"should\" occur including, without limitation, the performance of the assets of Osisko, the realization of the anticipated benefits deriving from Osisko’s investments and transactions and the estimate of GEOs to be received in 2018. Although Osisko believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may accordingly differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the actual results deriving from Osisko’s royalties, streams and other interests to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include, without limitation: influence of political or economic factors including fluctuations in the prices of the commodities and in value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, continued availability of capital and financing and general economic, market or business conditions; regulations and regulatory changes in national and local government, including permitting and licensing regimes and taxation policies; whether or not Osisko is determined to have “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) status as defined in Section 1297 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; potential changes in Canadian tax treatments of offshore streams or other interests, litigation, title, permit or license disputes; risks and hazards associated with the business of exploring, development and mining on the properties in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest including, but not limited to development, permitting, infrastructure, operating or technical difficulties, unusual or unexpected geological and metallurgical conditions, slope failures or cave-ins, flooding and other natural disasters or civil unrest, rate, grade and timing of production differences from mineral resource estimates or production forecasts or other uninsured risks; risk related to business opportunities that become available to, or are pursued by Osisko. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based upon assumptions management believes to be reasonable, including, without limitation: the ongoing operation of the properties in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest by the owners or operators of such properties in a manner consistent with past practice; the accuracy of public statements and disclosures made by the owners or operators of such underlying properties; no material adverse change in the market price of the commodities that underlie the asset portfolio; Osisko’s ongoing income and assets relating to the determination of its PFIC status, no material changes to existing tax treatments; no adverse development in respect of any significant property in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest; the accuracy of publicly disclosed expectations for the development of underlying properties that are not yet in production; and the absence of any other factors that could cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. However, there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Osisko cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements and investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.\nFor additional information with respect to these and other factors and assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, see the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in the most recent Annual Information Form of Osisko which is filed with the Canadian securities commissions and available electronically under Osisko's issuer profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR at www.sec.gov . The forward-looking information set forth herein reflects Osisko’s expectations as at the date of this press release and is subject to change after such date. Osisko disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nOsisko Gold Royalties Ltd Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) (tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 $ $ Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 332,617 333,705 Short-term investments 500 -
