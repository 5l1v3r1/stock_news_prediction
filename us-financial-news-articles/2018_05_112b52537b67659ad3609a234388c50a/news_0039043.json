The districts of Gero and Andar to the southeast were also attacked.\n“There is no way of supplying Andar by road, so it has to be supplied by air,” said provincial council member Ahmad Faqiri. “If the district doesn’t get supplies and reinforcements, there will be a disaster.” Reporting by Qadir Sediqi and James Mackenzie in KABUL, Mustafa Andalib in GHAZNI, Storay Karimi in HERAT and Abdul Malik in LASHKAR GAH; Editing by Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:23:31.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
