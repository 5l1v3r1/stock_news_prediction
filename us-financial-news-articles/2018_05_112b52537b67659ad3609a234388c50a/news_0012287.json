It hit a 2018 high of 92.83 on Wednesday and has gained around 4 percent in the last two weeks.\nBut some such as ING say the dollar’s momentum is also a reflection of a large structural short bet against the greenback built up by speculators in recent months. While short dollar bets have receded somewhat, they are still holding near a record $28 billion in late-April. For a related story, see\nFriday’s employment report for April will be evaluated for further indications of the strength of the U.S. labour market and inflation pressures.\n“Any slowdown in the pace of wage growth should re-energise dollar bears,” Christopher Wong, senior FX strategist for Maybank in Singapore, said in a note.\nKey support for the dollar index lies at its 200-day moving average, which is now near 92, Wong added.\nNonfarm payrolls probably increased by 192,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Payrolls rose by 103,000 positions in March, the smallest gain in six months, which economists dismissed as payback after unseasonably mild weather boosted hiring in February.\nThe euro edged lower to $1.1970, staying above a near four-month low of $1.1938 set on Wednesday.\nThe common currency had risen 0.3 percent on Thursday, shrugging off data showing an unexpected slowdown in euro zone inflation, as the dollar’s recent rally paused.\nThe Australian dollar bounced modestly as speculators took profits on long U.S. dollar positions. The Aussie rose 0.2 percent to $0.7549 AUD=D3, pulling away from an 11-month low near $0.7472 set earlier in the week.
