Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nThe California-based chipmaker is expected to post solid earnings and sales growth for its April-ended quarter, partially fueled by corporate tax cuts passed in December. Profit should pop 84.5 percent in its fiscal first quarter from a year earlier and a total 34.5 percent for its fiscal 2019 ending January from fiscal 2018, according to FactSet data. Sales are projected to growmore than 49 percent in its first quarter from a year earlier and 27 percent for fiscal 2019 from 2018.\n\"I think it's very, very bullish and if the stock comes out and actually forecasts higher-than-expected revenues going forward, I think you'll see even fresher highs after the call,\" Schlossberg said.\nMichael Bapis, partner and managing director at the Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors, is in the Nvidia bull camp, too.\n\"The big thing with technology is companies continue to reinvent themselves, and Nvidia has done a great job of that. I think you throw the fundamentals and the technicals out the window and ride the momentum,\" Bapis said Wednesday on \"Trading Nation.\" \"They're going to surge forward. They're in a growth phase right now.\"\nIts stock is on track to close Thursday with its sixth-straight session of gains. Over that period, its shares have soared 14 percent, far better than the 7 percent increase in the PHLX Semiconductor SOXX ETF.\nNvidia isn't the only semi name Bapis favors.\n\"We also like Micron as a value name in the space,\" said Bapis. \"In the technology space, they've recreated themselves and there's some value. They're trading at like 5 or 6 times earnings and we like them as well.\"\nMicron Technology has risen 13 percent during the past six sessions and is up more than 26 percent this year. It trades at 5 times forward earnings, below the 14.6 times multiple on the SOXX ETF.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T19:25:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
