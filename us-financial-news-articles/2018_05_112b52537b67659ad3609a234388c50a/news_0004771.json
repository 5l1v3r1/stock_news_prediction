This year we’ve got thinner rough than I can remember in the last 10 years. Unfortunately we’re going to be down in that two-and-a-quarter inch range.”\nThe wispy rough could perhaps encourage players to wield their drivers more frequently on a course that over time has become more of a strategic test than a bomber’s paradise.\nHowever, the absence of punishing rough is only one of the considerations players will have to take into account when deciding their weapon of choice off the tee, with numerous water hazards also uppermost in their minds.\n“We don’t want mega-rough,” Cox said. “Yes, I’d like it a little bit more dense and punishing but unfortunately we can’t control the weather.”\nCox also said only one hole — the driveable par-four 12th — had been modified since last year, with a few minor changes there designed to encourage more players to go for the green with their tee shots.\nAlso, some parts of the course will have a more open look after a hurricane last September knocked down hundreds of trees.\n“We’ve lost an awful lot of trees,” Cox said. “We’ve embarked on a fairly aggressive tree-replacement program.”\nWidely regarded as the most prestigious event outside the four major championships, the Players invariably boasts one of the strongest fields of the year.\nThe tournament will move back to its original March date next year after a 12-year run in May.\nThe earlier date will make way for the PGA Championship to move from August to May, which will compact the majors from early April (U.S. Masters) to mid July (British Open).
