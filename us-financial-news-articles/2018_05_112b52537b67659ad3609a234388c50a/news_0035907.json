He had noticed the relentless cycle of work.”\nIndia banned bonded labor in 1976. But the stark drawings reflect the reality of millions from marginalized communities still trapped in a cycle of debt bondage - the most prevalent form of slavery in India.\nPoverty and unemployment force men and women to take loans from moneylenders or employers. They then spend the next six months or more working to pay the debts back.\nIn many cases, their young children accompany them and work to help pay back the debt.\n“During rescues, children first tell you they don’t work in the kilns or mills,” said Jai Singh of Volunteers for Social Justice, a rights group that works in the brick kilns of northern Punjab state.\n“But when you ask them to show you what they do all day, they promptly go and start patting clay or turning bricks kept to dry. Nobody calls it work, but they are toiling.”\nIndia has at least 100,000 working brick kilns in employing about 23 million workers, a 2017 report by rights groups Anti-Slavery International and Volunteers for Social Justice found.\nOne third of those living at the kilns are children, it stated.\nDESPAIR TO HOPE Teacher Rajnikant Biswal is often asked to join teams on missions to rescue bonded laborers in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.\nThe first thing he does is to set up a hat-making corner while the raids are conducted.\n“I do it for the children trapped with their parents,” Biswal told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.\n“I give them a hat, do a little song and dance routine and then initiate a conversation. They hesitate but slowly tell me about their life and it is always heartbreaking.”\nIn her first drawing after she was rescued in 2014, an eight-year-old girl drew her pet duck, taken away as punishment by her parents’ boss.\nOne boy drew big dogs that would be unleashed on his family if they didn’t work, capturing the fear and violence that become part of their life, counselors said.\nAs time passes though, the images become more positive.\nA teenager rescued from a rice mill with his family drew the helicopter he hopes to one day buy for his parents and a modest house with a car parked outside.\nThese pictures are more colorful - bright skies, birds, flowers in bloom and a house full of people watching television.\n“When they draw life outside the mill, there is a burst of colors,” said Jhona, adding that children often find it easier than their parents to imagine a better life.\nAdults need more psychological help to become truly free as they are often too scared to admit to abuse for fear of retribution from their former owners, counselors say.\nWhile survivors of sex trafficking often receive help in shelter homes, rescued bonded laborers simply return to their villages and completely shut down.\n“But children are always hopeful,” Biswal said.\n“It takes a while, but they eventually share their dreams and they are beautiful.”\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Claire Cozens Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.
