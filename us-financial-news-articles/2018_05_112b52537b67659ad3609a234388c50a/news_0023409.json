The Rams most often wore a white and blue jersey and white pants with a navy blue stripe for home games last season, and the same jersey with blue pants on the road.\n“We have spent the year educating them on our fan base,” Demoff said, per the Los Angeles Times. “We forwarded them all of the fan complaints, the emails we get, so I think they’re well aware of our fans’ preferences.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) “It was always with the idea that we’d be able to revisit it during the offseason when there’s more time to plan,” Demoff said. “Hopefully, they recognize the challenge we have and appreciate the connection the fan base has to the blue and yellow. If we can avoid wearing our Navy jerseys next year, we will.”\nDemoff said the team has begun the process of redesigned uniforms with Nike, with an eye toward 2019 or 2020. The team also expects to open its new stadium in Inglewood in 2020.\n“As we do every offseason, we are working with Nike and a number of our clubs, this year including the Rams, on various issues and ideas around their uniforms,” an NFL spokesperson told the Times via email.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:49:16.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
