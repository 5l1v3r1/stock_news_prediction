The logo of Safran is seen outside the company's heanquarters in Paris, France, February 24, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nCFM International, a joint-venture between the two aerospace groups, aims to deliver around 1,100 LEAP engines this year.\nSafran Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said no unexpected setbacks had been discovered at Zodiac Aerospace, since Safran took control of the troubled French seats manufacturer in February.\n“There have been no major (bad) surprises but there haven’t been any good surprises either,” Petitcolin told the AJPAE aerospace media association, adding it would take some 12-18 months for delayed airline seat projects currently being handled by Zodiac to work their way completely through the system.\nSafran hopes for an inaugural contract for its new E-Taxi electrically powered aircraft taxiing system at the Farnborough Airshow in July, Petitcolin said.
