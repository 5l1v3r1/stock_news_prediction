On Wednesday it had touched a five-month high of 93.632.\nOil prices gained on Wednesday, shaking off the effects of a strengthening dollar, after an inventory report showed U.S. crude and gasoline stocks fell more than expected.\nBrent crude futures gained 85 cents to settle at $79.28 a barrel on Wednesday.\nReporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:16:07.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
