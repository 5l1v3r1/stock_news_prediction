To think that that could be happening in the next couple of weeks is amazing.”\nThe youngest Socceroo at the Antalya camp, Arzani survived Van Marwijk’s first cut down to 26 and is very much in the mix for the final 23.\nAustralia do not lack for skilled or diligent players across the field but are crying out for a bright spark to help conjure goals for a side that still finds a place for 38-year-old veteran Tim Cahill.\nArzani may be half the age of Australia’s World Cup hero but he has been spoken of with a similar enthusiasm that Cahill generated in his formative years.\nThe teenager joined the Melbourne City setup in 2016 but was basically unused until January.\nTwo days after his 19th birthday, Arzani came off the bench to set up two goals and spark a 2-1 comeback win over Wellington Phoenix.\nThe breakthrough triggered a rich vein of form and he played a key role in pushing Warren Joyce-coached City into the playoffs before being awarded the A-League’s “Young Player of the Year”.\n“We don’t have anything like him as a player,” former Australia defender Tony Vidmar, as assistant coach at City, told local media.\n“He just has this belief and confidence that every time he gets the ball he can get past a player ... and he’s proved that he can do it.”\nArzani missed out on Van Marwijk’s first squad named in March and the subsequent World Cup warmups against Norway and Colombia.\nThe snub fanned fears he might yet be swooped off by Carlos Queiroz-coached Iran but Van Marwijk said he needed a few more games to assess him.\n“He is a player who can make a difference,” the Dutchman said after naming Arzani in his preliminary 32-man squad.\n“I like players who can make a difference. Maybe a world championship is too early, but I will not hesitate to nominate him if he can make a difference, in maybe the last 10-15 minutes.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T12:29:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
