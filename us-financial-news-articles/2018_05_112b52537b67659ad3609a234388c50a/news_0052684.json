It was nearly 2 basis points lower than late on Wednesday.\nA week ago, the 10-year TIPS breakeven rate hit 2.21 percent, which was the highest level since August 2014, Reuters and Tradeweb data showed.\nLast Friday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.128 percent, the highest since July 2011.
