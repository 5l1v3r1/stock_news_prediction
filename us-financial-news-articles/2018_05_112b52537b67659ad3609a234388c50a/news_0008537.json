(“Alacer” or the “Corporation”) (TSX:ASR) (ASX:AQG) announced today that it has filed its 2018 first quarter operating and financial results and related management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”). The corresponding financial statements and MD&A are available on www.AlacerGold.com and on www.SEDAR.com . All currencies referenced herein are denominated in USD unless otherwise stated.\nRod Antal, Alacer’s President and Chief Executive Officer , stated, “A good start to the year from our oxide operations with 37,875 ounces of gold production generating robust operating cashflow at All-in Sustaining Costs of US$737 per ounce. Production and costs are tracking in line with guidance as we progressively transition from oxide to predominately sulfide ore in the second half of the year.\nThe Çöpler Sulfide Project capital estimate declined further to $692 million or currently 7% under the original capital estimate of $744 million, meaning it will be delivered under budget. The start-up of the sulfide plant is only a quarter away and remains on schedule as we enter the final stage of construction. Commissioning activities are advanced, and the new operations team have embedded themselves into these efforts. The sulfide ore stockpiles have grown to over 1 million contained gold ounces and we have started physically testing the stockpile management strategy.\nThe rest of our pipeline continues to advance with permitting progressing for Çakmaktepe and mining is on track to commence in the fourth quarter. At Ardich exciting drill results were released in the quarter indicating the discovery of a new oxide ore source. Exploration work at Ardich continues.”\nHighlights\nStrategic\nThe Sulfide Project is approximately 85% complete, with commissioning underway. The Project is on schedule for start-up in Q3 2018. The Sulfide Project is under budget, and the capital cost estimate has been reduced from $744 million to $692 million. On January 15, 2018, the Corporation released 2018 Guidance. 1 Pending approval of the revised Çakmaktepe Environmental Impact Assessment and Operating Permits, Alacer plans to commence mining at Çakmaktepe in Q4 2018. Haul road construction from Çakmaktepe to the Çöpler infrastructure is progressing. On February 26, 2018, the Corporation released an exploration update on the Ardich Project 2 . Exploration drilling and analysis work at Ardich continues. The Gediktepe Project DFS is progressing with scheduled completion later in 2018.\nOperational\nAt March 31, 2018, the Çöpler Gold Mine, including the Sulfide Project expansion construction, surpassed 10.8 million man-hours worked and has operated 491 days without a lost-time injury. Gold production was 37,875 ounces, and attributable gold production 3 was 30,300 ounces. Total Cash Costs (C2) per ounce 4 were $552 and All‐in Sustaining Costs per ounce 4 were $737. Expansion of the existing heap leach pad capacity to 58 million tonnes continues. In-pit exploration at the Çöpler Gold Mine continues with the goal of adding oxide production. Sulfide stockpiles at March 31, 2018 were 9.6 million tonnes at an average grade of 3.33 g/t gold or over 1 million contained gold ounces.\nFinancial\nThe Corporation ended the first quarter with cash of $137 million, debt of $250 million, and $100 million undrawn on the finance facility.

(“Anagold”), and the remaining 20% owned by Lidya Madencilik Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (“Lidya Mining”). The Corporation’s primary focus is to leverage its cornerstone Çöpler Gold Mine and strong balance sheet to maximize portfolio value and free cash flow, minimize project risk, and therefore, create maximum value for shareholders. The Çöpler Gold Mine is located in east-central Turkey in the Erzincan Province, approximately 1,100 kilometers southeast from Istanbul and 550 kilometers east from Ankara, Turkey’s capital city.\nAlacer is actively pursuing initiatives to enhance value beyond the current mine plan:\nÇöpler Oxide Production Optimization – Expansion of the existing heap leach pad capacity to 58 million tonnes continues in preparation for the addition of oxide ore from Çakmaktepe reserves expected in Q4 2018, pending approval of the revised Çakmaktepe Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) and operating permits. The Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to extend oxide production beyond the current reserves with in-pit exploration, Çöpler District exploration, and evaluating options to increase heap leach pad capacity, including potential for a new heap leach pad to the west of the Çöpler Gold Mine. Çöpler Sulfide Expansion Project (the “Sulfide Project”) – The Sulfide Project is approximately 85% complete with commissioning underway. Additionally, the Project is under budget and on schedule for start-up in Q3 2018. The Sulfide Project is expected to deliver long-term growth with robust financial returns and adds 20 years of production at Çöpler. The Sulfide Project will bring Çöpler’s remaining life-of-mine (“LoM”) gold production to approximately 4 million ounces at All-in Sustaining Costs averaging $645 per ounce 5 . The Corporation continues to pursue opportunities to further expand its current operating base to become a sustainable multi-mine producer with a focus on Turkey. The systematic and focused exploration efforts in the Çöpler District, as well as in other regions of Turkey, are progressing. In February 2018, the Corporation announced additional positive drilling results at Ardich within the Çöpler District. The Çöpler District remains the focus, with the goal of continuing to grow oxide resources that will deliver production utilizing the existing Çöpler infrastructure. In the other regions of Turkey, targeted exploration work continues, and work on the Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) for the Gediktepe Project 6 is expected to be complete later in 2018.\nAlacer is a Canadian corporation incorporated in the Yukon Territory with its primary listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
