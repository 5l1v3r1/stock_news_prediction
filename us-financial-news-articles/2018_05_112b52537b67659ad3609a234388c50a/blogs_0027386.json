For others, maybe the premiums have become unaffordable or there's no one they want to leave the money to anymore.\nRegardless of the cause, one option for an unwanted life insurance policy is to sell it. That's right: Get cash now from investors, who will get the death benefit when you die.\nRich Legg | Getty Images \"It is a little weird … and it's a morbid conversation,\" said certified financial planner Ashley Foster, founder of Nxt:Gen Financial Planning in Houston. \"But if someone is having trouble paying their premiums … or doesn't have an insurable need, it can sometimes make sense.\"\nWhile the thought of strangers financially benefiting from your death might be creepy, selling a policy can be wiser than simply walking away from it or only getting the surrender value.\n\"It's an asset like any other,\" said CFP Barry Flagg, managing principal at Triangulum Financial Partners in Tampa. \"If I had a mutual fund on my balance sheet and it didn't perform how I wanted it to, I wouldn't just give it back to the mutual fund company.\"\nHere's the skinny on \"life settlements.\"\nHow life settlements work The transaction basically involves a life-settlement company giving you cash in exchange for your policy. You no longer pay the premiums, and when you pass away, the death benefit goes to the investor who now owns it.\nGenerally speaking, if you're age 65 or older and your policy's death benefit is at least $100,000, it could have value to investors, according to the Life Insurance Settlement Association.\nIf you're worried that a Tony Soprano-like hitman will appear to free up that benefit quickly, there's little need to worry.\nWhen you sell the policy, it gets held in a blind pool overseen by a financial institution other than the buyer. Additionally, your policy can only be resold as part of a larger transaction that includes other policies.\nshow chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:34:12.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
