The couple, who have two daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, divorced in 1996.\nSOPHIE RHYS-JONES AND PRINCE EDWARD\nPrince Edward, the queen’s youngest son, married public relations executive Sophie Rhys-Jones at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on June 1999.\nThe couple, who were given the titles Earl and Countess of Wessex, did not want the wedding to be turned into a state occasion, which meant there was no ceremonial state or military involvement.\nTheir first baby, named Louise Alice Elizabeth Mary Mountbatten-Windsor was born in 2003 and their son James Viscount Severn was born in 2007.
