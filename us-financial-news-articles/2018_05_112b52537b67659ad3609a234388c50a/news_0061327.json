The new site was created by Adderton as a tool to educate and inform wireless consumers about a few of the concerns with the proposed Sprint/T-Mobile merger. In fact, T-Mobile and Sprint recently launched their own site, ALLFOR5G.COM , to offer up their talking points regarding the proposed merger. But Adderton and many other industry pundits believe their narrative omits critical details about the impact the merger will have on consumers and the prepaid wireless marketplace. Today’s announcement follows closely on the heels of Adderton’s May 21, 2018 press release in which he laid out some of those concerns.\n“We have some critical concerns about the proposed merger, most of which center on the need to protect the 50 million prepaid wireless subscribers in this country, and on the need to implement wholesale rate protections on behalf of the hundreds of MVNOs, or carriers that lease network capacity from Sprint, T-Mobile or both,” said Adderton. “We built this website to make sure that consumers, wireless users, legislators and staffers at the FCC and DOJ hear and understand these concerns. We encourage everyone to visit ALL4PRICE.COM to get-up-to-speed, share the links, and be heard using the #ALL4PRICE hashtag on social media.”\nMEDIA CONTACT\nMegan Kathman\nSkyya\nph: (646) 454-9378\nmegan@skyya.com\nSource: Boost Global", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w4MFyV_r4jT0av05inFH-lj89tLoVdTkFyi3Mcwzs38T8Y27PoQzKyxbFOuHZ4Dgt-D-oM7HkFVf25-O6wzspw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Sbm0uNREEnMXb6w_g7jughuOAz9Klq1nGgz7t3nfOPclyL7i6MmNoEFPdLpES15yPJ3c0x_KeVhIHC7UA4fXLdpW3rgY7TVt80xxY5nix5zyA5QFYtU7z46VDv4BLtgH2cee83Q6LapwyKNVUuw16ndbdH5dPXDC5epRnbqXdBLNKYSNjgcaUPoR_KGrIH11Foim9Nz_Q2tKhrHcUxgD2-2BCxWJhQRTQjLIafkKDatosmYlfonCawX36meKsLwb3NwF-s4GxCOrelBv6LcMg7twBAUDsLafo9BwhL3oGh4nydugyTnfpO9OT_YdBo_1oHZj5VKbPX6m2vR0TN6yUUeHkPHLb9EfdoLALWAnHOE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=niMRJU7ODrUri4IlroNuN_BVoepmB40GdX2RmqDsRzcVrFG-uSmjSwRoOxHh8tbz3YWCHIrh8QXk4dovhfuPog==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=niMRJU7ODrUri4IlroNuN18O0sXNcQRU4R2bhQMpvVGBCcROkcn42KRlm2mnT5pGuE_0vc5nC-exF_Q-ip-xIg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MUI3hXcmad1aARHLVFyxzFpbALyrRydkUYNQPnnNYT-mkfquNInMHMBBEWShsPlzz6-LBzGPjEdbfezWT4_fIQ=="], "published": "2018-05-30T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T00:50:43.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
