Significant liquidity of $417 million\nWATERFORD, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MPM Holdings Inc. (“Momentive” or the “Company”) (OTCQX:MPMQ) today announced results\n“We are pleased to report another quarter of significant Segment EBITDA growth and margin expansion,” said Jack Boss, Chief Executive Officer and President. “These results were driven by strong end-market demand across our entire portfolio, particularly within our personal care, automotive and electronic end markets. Our continued earnings momentum demonstrates the success of our clearly defined competitive strategy focused on driving growth in higher-margin specialty applications and optimizing our basics business and cost structure.”\n“In addition, we are excited about our new NXT* facility in Europe, which doubles our capacity in our fastest growing product line and enables state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities on two continents. This will allow us to strengthen our leadership position in automotive tire applications and enable additional new product offerings.”\nMr. Boss concluded, “As we look out into 2018, we expect strong demand, solid and improving industry fundamentals, pricing tailwinds, and more material EBITDA contribution from the capital investments we have made in our specialty product portfolio over the last several years. Further, we have implemented broad based price increases across the entire product portfolio, which are expected to benefit fiscal year 2018 results. This, along with our recently announced $15 million restructuring initiative, should continue to drive considerable margin expansion.”\n1 Defined as total principal value of debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by Segment EBITDA. First Quarter 2018 Results\nNet Sales. Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $657 million, an increase of 21% compared with $544 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by volume gains across all of Momentive’s segments, which reflected the benefits of our strategic growth investments and increased demand in automotive, agriculture, personal care and industrial end markets, as well as pricing initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Income (Loss). Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $20 million compared with a net loss of $30 million in the prior year period.\nSegment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $94 million, an increase of 36% compared with $69 million in the prior year period. The increase in Segment EBITDA was driven by operating leverage and the same factors that impacted revenue growth in the quarter, and partially offset by approximately $10 million of weather-related disruptions in January. Momentive expects about $5 million of the impact to reverse in the second half of 2018.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables reflect net sales and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. See “Non-U.S. GAAP Measures” and Schedule 4 to this release for further information regarding Segment EBITDA and for a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Segment EBITDA.\nNet Sales (1) :\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Performance Additives $ 248 $ 220 Formulated and Basic Silicones 357 275 Quartz Technologies 52 49 Total $ 657 $ 544 (1) Intersegment sales are not significant and, as such, are eliminated within the selling segment.

The most recent initiative targets primarily selling, general, and administrative cost reductions. The Company expects net costs to achieve savings of approximately $10 million. Momentive previously completed global restructuring programs and siloxane production transformation of its Leverkusen, Germany, facility that generated approximately $45 million in annual savings.\nLiquidity and Balance Sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, Momentive had net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, of approximately $1.1 billion. In addition, at March 31, 2018, Momentive had $417 million in liquidity, including $173 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and $244 million of availability under its senior secured asset-based revolving loan (“ABL”) facility (undrawn, with $56 million letters of credit outstanding). During the first quarter of 2018, Momentive extended the Company’s ABL Facility to March 2023 subject to the terms outlined in the Amendment Agreement and increased the commitments under the ABL Facility by $30 million for a total of $300 million. Momentive expects to have adequate liquidity to fund its operations for the foreseeable future from cash on its balance sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available for borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nEarnings Call\nMomentive will host a teleconference to discuss first quarter 2018 results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.

Segment EBITDA is an important measure used by the Company's senior management and board of directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net (loss) income or other results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See Schedule 4 to this release for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Segment EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro-forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. The Company believes that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about the Company’s ability to comply with its financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income determined in accordance with GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on the Company’s indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because the Company uses capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of the Company’s operations, it is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the indentures should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense. See Schedule 5 to this release for a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements related to our transformation and restructuring activities, growth and productivity initiatives, anticipated cost savings, growth, and market recovery, the impact of work stoppage and other incidents on our operations and competitiveness.
