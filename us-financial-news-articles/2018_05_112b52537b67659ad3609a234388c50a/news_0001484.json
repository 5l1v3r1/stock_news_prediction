He added, it suggests the CEO is either not focused on numerical or financial issues, or is worried the numbers don't tell a good story.\n\"When financial questions are asked, they should be addressed,\" he said. If Musk did not want to field more questions on Tesla's finances, he could defer to a CFO, noting that neither Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos nor IBM CEO Ginni Rometty are present on their quarterly earnings calls, leaving the work to other executives.\nAnd from time to time executives will steer conversations with analysts who are asking too many questions, and Musk has dismissed questions in the past.\n\"What struck investors last night was that the dismissiveness was heightened, relative to what Elon had done before and what is commonplace on earnings calls,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T19:52:19.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
