The programme remains in place for now and companies can still apply guarantees, Hermes said.\nEuropean powers have vowed to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing, but have admitted they would struggle to provide the guarantees Tehran seeks.
