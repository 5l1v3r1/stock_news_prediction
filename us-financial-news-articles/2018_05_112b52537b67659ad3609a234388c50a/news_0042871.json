So, now two years later, as the rubber is hitting the road, does the Tesla Model 3 live up to the hype? Slow your roll—literally, Consumer Reports tells anxious auto buyers.\n“Our testers also found flaws—big flaws—such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls,” writes Consumer Reports’ Patrick Olsen in his Tesla Model 3 review . The braking issues kept Consumer Reports from giving the Model 3 its recommendation. Of the 57 hybrid and electric vehicles Consumer Reports has reviewed, it ranks the Tesla Model 3 sixth, behind the front-running 2018 Toyota Prius.\n“The Tesla’s stopping distance of 152 feet from 60 mph was far worse than any contemporary car we’ve tested and about 7 feet longer than the stopping distance of a Ford F-150 full-sized pickup,” writes Olsen. Issues with braking and difficult to use controls cause the @Tesla #Model3 to fall short of a CR recommendation. https://t.co/f6r2s9oLJy\n— Consumer Reports (@ConsumerReports) May 21, 2018 SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT", "external_links": ["https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrids-evs/tesla-model-3-review-falls-short-of-consumer-reports-recommendation/", "https://twitter.com/ConsumerReports/status/998595636403597312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/f6r2s9oLJy", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Model3?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-05-21T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T00:40:22.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
