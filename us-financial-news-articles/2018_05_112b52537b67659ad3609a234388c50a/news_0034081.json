(NASDAQ: DMPI) (\"DelMar\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new cancer therapies, announced its financial results for the third quarter ended March 31, 2018. DelMar executive management will host a business update conference call for investors, analysts and other interested parties on May 30, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\"This quarter has been a pivotal and important period for DelMar. I am pleased with our enhanced focus on leveraging VAL-083's unique mechanism of action to advance both of our Phase 2 clinical programs including MGMT-unmethylated, second-line, bevacizumab (Avastin) naïve glioblastoma, and MGMT-unmethylated, first-line, temozolomide-naïve glioblastoma. MGMT methylation status has become increasingly important in the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma, and a routine part of clinical practice as it is a well-established biomarker that correlates with resistance to the standard-of-care chemotherapy, temozolomide, and with patient outcomes. We believe that using this biomarker will optimize patient selection for treatment in future trials with our lead drug candidate, VAL-083, thereby streamlining development and enhancing opportunities for success in our clinical development programs,\" commented Saiid Zarrabian, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\nContinued enrolling patients in the Company's Phase 2, open-label, second-line Avastin-naïve, MGMT-unmethylated, recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) trial being conducted at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Increased patient enrollment rate of the Phase 2, open-label, first-line temozolomide-naïve, MGMT-unmethylated GBM trial at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center Presented a positive interim update from ongoing open-label Phase 2 clinical trials in MGMT-unmethylated GBM at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) held in April, 2018 Presented promising preclinical results supporting the potential of VAL-083 in the treatment of cancer patients whose tumors exhibit features that make them resistant to, or unlikely to respond to, currently available therapies at the Annual Meeting of AACR held in April, 2018 Presented promising preclinical data supporting the potential of VAL-083 as part of second- line combination treatment with Avastin for GBM at the biennial Canadian Neuro-Oncology meeting in May 2018 Ramped-up evaluation of improved development strategies for VAL-083's ovarian program, including specific biomarkers for optimal VAL-083 efficacy and combination treatment with PARP inhibitors, utilizing our newly formed clinical advisory board Based on overall clinical and corporate development progress achieved to date, we expect to have cash available to fund planned operations into the third quarter of calendar 2019\nFor further details on the Company's operating and financial results, as well as more detail about its updated strategy, refer to DelMar's 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 15, 2018, http://ir.delmarpharma.com/all-sec-filings .\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nDelMar plans to host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provide a corporate update on May 30, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

By focusing on understanding tumor biology and mechanisms of treatment resistance, the Company identifies biomarkers to personalize new therapies in indications where patients are failing, or are unable to tolerate, standard-of-care treatments.\nThe Company's current pipeline is based around VAL-083, a \"first-in-class,\" small-molecule chemotherapeutic with a novel mechanism of action that has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including central nervous system, ovarian and other solid tumors (e.g. NSCLC, bladder cancer, head & neck) in U.S. clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Based on DelMar's internal research programs, and these prior NCI-sponsored clinical studies, the Company is conducting clinical trials to support the development and commercialization of VAL-083 to solve significant unmet medical needs.\nVAL-083 is also being studied in two collaborator-supported, biomarker-driven, Phase 2 clinical trials for MGMT-unmethylated GBM. Overcoming MGMT-mediated resistance represents a significant unmet medical need in the treatment of GBM. In addition, DelMar recently announced the allowance of a separate IND for VAL-083 as a potential treatment for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\nFurther information on DelMar's clinical trials can be found on clinicaltrials.gov : https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=val-083&cntry1=&state1=&recrs\nFor additional information, please visit http://delmarpharma.com/ ; or contact DelMar Pharmaceuticals Investor Relations: ir@delmarpharma.com / (604) 629-5989.\nConnect with the Company on Twitter , LinkedIn , Facebook , and Google+ .\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAny statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
