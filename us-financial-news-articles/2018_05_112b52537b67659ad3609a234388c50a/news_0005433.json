It has said it is cooperating with authorities and addressing its shortcomings.\nThe board of Barclays had initially recommended the reappointment of KPMG as one of its external auditors for 2018, to be considered at its annual general meeting (AGM) on May 15.\n“Subsequent to the release of our AGM Notice, the Board has carefully evaluated the on-going and more recent developments and decided that it is no longer able to support the reappointment of KPMG,” the bank said in a statement.\nThe appointment of KPMG will cease on completion of the statutory and regulatory audit and reporting matters relating to the 2017 financial year, which is expected to take effect by approximately May 31, it added.\nMinutes after the announcement, KPMG South Africa said in a separate statement it was disappointed by, but accepted the decision.\nThe bank will start a formal process to appoint a second auditor, it said. In the meantime Ernst & Young Inc will be the sole auditor of the group.\nBanks are required by the South African Reserve Bank policy to have two external auditors.
