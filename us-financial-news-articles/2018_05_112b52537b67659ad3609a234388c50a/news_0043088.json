NAI has said it wants to merge them if both companies support the deal.\n\"The board of directors has taken this step because it believes it is in the best interests of all CBS stockholders, is necessary to protect stockholders interests and would unlock significant stockholder value,\" CBS said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware, Jessica Toonkel in New York and Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; editing by Tom Brown and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:20:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
