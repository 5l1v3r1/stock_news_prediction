(NASDAQ:ZGNX), a pharmaceutical company developing therapies for the treatment of rare central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today provided a corporate update and announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We continue to advance towards multiple key catalysts in our late-stage lead program, ZX008 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, including results from our second Phase 3 trial, Study 1504, and U.S. and EU regulatory filings targeted for the fourth quarter of 2018,” said Stephen J. Farr, Ph.D., President and CEO of Zogenix. “To this end, following receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation in the first quarter, we recently conducted a successful Type B meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss our ZX008 clinical development program and planned New Drug Application (NDA) content for ZX008 in Dravet syndrome.”\n“In addition, we continued to add to the positive efficacy data set for ZX008 in Dravet syndrome through the presentation of further analyses of Study 1, our first Phase 3 trial, in two poster presentations at the 2018 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting,” continued Dr. Farr. “Importantly, the results of a post-hoc analysis evaluating the effect of ZX008 in a subset of patients who had previously failed treatment with stiripentol, a commonly used antiepileptic drug, showed that the efficacy and tolerability results in this subgroup were robust and comparable to those achieved in the full Study 1 population.”\n“We also continued to enroll patients in our ongoing global Phase 3 trial of ZX008 in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in children and adults up to age 35, and had 16 open sites in the U.S. and Canada at the end of April and are focused on opening others in North America and completing Ethics Committee submissions to several European countries,” concluded Dr. Farr.\nCorporate Update\nConducted a successful Breakthrough Therapy Type B meeting with the FDA regarding the ZX008 clinical development program and planned NDA submission in Dravet syndrome. Key outcomes included:\n- Reaffirmation of Study 1 and Study 1504 as the clinical basis for the NDA submission;\n- Concurrence that the anticipated ZX008 exposures in the Dravet syndrome program at the time of the NDA submission are likely to be sufficient to support the filing; and\n- Agreement on the schedule for a rolling NDA submission.\nEnrolled and randomized a total of 87 patients into the efficacy cohort of Study 1504, with last patient scheduled to exit the treatment period at the end of May and top-line results expected end of June/early July.\nPresented new efficacy and safety results from Study 1 at the AAN 2018 Annual Meeting:\n- Positive results of a post-hoc analysis evaluating the effect of ZX008 on controlling convulsive seizures in patients in Study 1 who had previously failed therapy with stiripentol. The data demonstrated that patients taking ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day (max. 30 mg/day) achieved a 60.8% greater reduction in mean monthly convulsive seizures compared to placebo (p=0.002). Additionally, in the 0.8 mg/kg/day group, 72.7% of patients achieved an equal or greater than 50% reduction in convulsive seizures (p=0.006), and 50.0% achieved an equal or greater than 75% reduction (p=0.036). Across these and other efficacy measures, the results from the subset analysis of stiripentol non-responders were comparable to the full Study 1 population, indicating that a history of non-responsiveness to stiripentol is not a predictor of negative response to treatment with ZX008 in Dravet syndrome.\n- Positive results of a prespecified secondary analysis evaluating the effect of ZX008 on total seizure frequency, showing that treatment with ZX008 at doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.8 mg/kg/day (max. 30 mg/day) resulted in significantly greater reductions in median monthly total seizure frequency compared to placebo (p= 0.031 and p<0.001, respectively).\n- Encouraging preliminary quality of life and cognitive function data showing that patients treated with ZX008 over the 14-week double-blind treatment period experienced significant improvements on select measures of quality of life and executive function compared to those on placebo.\nContinued enrollment in global Phase 3 trial of ZX008 for treatment of LGS, Study 1601. At the end of April, 16 sites in the U.S. and Canada were open to recruit patients and Ethics Committee submissions to several European countries have been completed.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nDue to the wind-down of Sumavel DosePro manufacturing operations in September 2017, the Company recorded no revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
