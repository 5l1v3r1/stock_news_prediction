The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to refinance all of its outstanding senior secured bridge loans (the “Bridge Loans”), for working capital for the Company and its subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes, including the financing of future acquisitions and investments. The Notes are to be issued at an issue price of 102.000% plus accrued interest from December 1, 2017. The offering is expected to close on May 7, 2018, subject to certain closing conditions.\nThe net proceeds from the Bridge Loans were used by HC2 to complete various acquisitions, including the majority equity interest in DTV America Corporation, the assets of Mako Communications, LLC and Three Angels Broadcasting Network, Inc., as well as certain assets from OTA Broadcasting, LLC, Azteca America, and the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Northstar and to pay fees and expenses relating to these acquisitions.\nThe Notes will be issued under the same indenture as the Company’s existing 11.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the “Existing Notes”). The Notes will constitute part of a single class of securities with the Existing Notes.
