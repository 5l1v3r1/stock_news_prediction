While it draws a line under an episode some insiders had feared might cost him his job, Staley is the first sitting CEO of a major bank to face such a penalty.\nBarclays had no immediate comment.\n$1 = 0.7381 pounds Reporting By Lawrence White and Huw Jones; editing by Emma Rumney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:31:01.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
