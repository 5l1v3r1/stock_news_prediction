Myanmar denies the accusation, saying it was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations.\nThe May 7 letter, seen by Reuters, asked the Bangladesh government about the “circumstances surrounding the presence” of Rohingya in the country.\nBangladesh foreign ministry spokesman Touhidul Islam said the government was considering the ICC’s request.\n“Before sending any observation the country needs some time to take a decision,” he told Reuters.
