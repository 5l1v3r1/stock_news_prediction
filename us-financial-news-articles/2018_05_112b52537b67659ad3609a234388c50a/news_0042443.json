In subsequent quarters, a combination of low oil prices, low bond yields and volatile equity markets prompted sovereign investors to pull money from listed securities.\nSome rainy-day SWFs were tapped by governments to fill budget gaps, whilst others sought better returns in unlisted infrastructure, private equity or real estate investments.\nHowever, oil prices have recovered from a January 2016 low of under $30 a barrel to almost $80, the highest since late 2014, as supply has tightened. Meanwhile, some SWFs are thought to be hitting the upper limit on their allocations to private markets.
