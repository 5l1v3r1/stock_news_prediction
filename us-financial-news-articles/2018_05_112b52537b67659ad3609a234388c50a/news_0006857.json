Harry traveled in one of them to the wedding of his elder brother William to Kate Middleton in 2011 when he acted as best man.\nKensington Palace said the carriage would be pulled by Windsor Grey horses, which have drawn the carriages of monarchs and members of the royal family Queen Victoria in the 19th Century, and would be escorted by members of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.
