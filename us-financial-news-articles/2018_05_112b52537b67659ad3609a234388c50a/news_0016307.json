That’s where I’ve gone the last few years that has got me into trouble.”\nSpieth has won three majors — the 2015 Masters and U.S. Open plus last year’s British Open.\nHe held the world number one ranking for 26 weeks and is now fourth. Spieth has not troubled the trophy engraver since his victory at Royal Birkdale last July.\nThe American will play the first two rounds here with fellow 20-something major champions Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas.\nThe large galleries are likely to amp up the atmosphere, but Spieth knows he needs to remain calm.\n“I’ve kind of struggled a little this year with kind of rushing my thoughts,” he said.\n“If I give myself a little bit of time and leeway, that’s been the best route in the past, so I’m trying to do that now.” (Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ken Ferris)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T20:47:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
