(NASDAQ:TRVN) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its pipeline of differentiated new chemical entities, including its lead asset, oliceridine, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for potential approval this year.\n“In 2018, we have made important progress in Trevena’s evolution,” said Maxine Gowen, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer. “We have initiated a smooth and constructive transition in preparation for Carrie Bourdow to assume the CEO position later this year. We also have begun to broaden the potential revenue from oliceridine by completing our first ex-US licensing agreements. We continue to have an ongoing productive dialogue with the FDA as they review our oliceridine NDA, and look forward to an advisory committee meeting later this year and potential approval in November. ”\nFirst quarter and recent corporate highlights\nNew Drug Application (NDA) for oliceridine submitted and accepted. In January 2018, the Company announced that the FDA has accepted the Company’s NDA for oliceridine, an investigational product for the management of moderate to severe acute pain. Oliceridine is the first G protein biased ligand of the mu receptor, and was designed to provide IV opioid pain relief with fewer associated adverse effects. The FDA has informed the Company that it intends to convene an advisory committee meeting to discuss the oliceridine NDA ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review date of November 2, 2018. If approved, the Company expects commercial launch of oliceridine in the first quarter of 2019, following DEA scheduling.\nLicensed oliceridine for development and commercialization in two ex-US territories . In April, the Company and privately held Pharmbio Korea Inc. announced that they have entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of oliceridine in South Korea. In May, the Company and Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. announced that they have entered an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of oliceridine in China. Under these agreements, Trevena will receive a total of $5.5 million in upfront payments, and is eligible for further regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties. The Company remains in active discussions for licensing oliceridine in additional territories.\nCarrie Bourdow selected as next CEO . In April, the Company announced that President and Chief Executive Officer, Maxine Gowen, Ph.D., will retire on October 1, 2018 and will continue to serve on the Trevena Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has selected Carrie L. Bourdow, who currently serves as Trevena’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to be the Company’s next President and Chief Executive Officer, effective October 1, 2018.\nEarly pipeline advancing. In March, the Company announced that its early pipeline programs continued to progress. The Company has completed dosing in its Phase 1 study of TRV250 for treatment of acute migraine, which had been extended following positive interim results for the initially planned doses demonstrating dose-proportional exposure after subcutaneous administration and adequate oral bioavailability to support further clinical development. The Company expects to release data in the coming months. In addition, the Company is evaluating a set of novel S1P modulators that may offer a new non-narcotic approach to managing chronic pain. The Company continues to expect complete characterization of the lead compounds in 2018 to determine if any merit IND-enabling studies to support Phase 1 clinical trials.\nFinancial results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Trevena reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $9.0 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with a net loss attributable to common stockholders 2017 of $20.7 million, or $0.36 per share. Research and development expenses were $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $16.1 million for the same period in 2017; general and administrative expenses were $5.1 million, compared to $4.9 million 2017. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $61.6 million as of March 31, 2018. The Company expects this amount, together with interest thereon and proceeds from oliceridine ex-U.S. licensing activities, to be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from today’s date.\nFor additional details, please see the Company’s Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC today.\nConference Call and Webcast\nDate: May 3, 2018\nTime: 8:00 a.m. EDT\nTelephone Access: (855) 465-0180\nInternational: (484) 756-4313\nWebcast: http://investors.trevena.com/index.cfm\nConference ID: 1350009\nAbout Trevena\nTrevena, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on providing better, safer therapies to patients in pain.
