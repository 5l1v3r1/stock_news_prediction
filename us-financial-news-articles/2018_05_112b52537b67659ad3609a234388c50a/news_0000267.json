(NYSE: VST) closed its merger with Dynegy, Inc., creating the leading, lowest-cost integrated power company across the key competitive markets in the United States. Through the combination, Vistra has achieved earnings, geographic, and fuel diversification and transformed into a highly efficient, natural gas-centric power plant fleet with approximately 41,000 MW of capacity (84 percent of which is in the attractive ERCOT, PJM, and ISO-NE regions). In addition, Vistra has expanded its retail footprint and created a platform for further retail growth and integration, while maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet – with an intention to de-lever to a 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA target by year-end 2019.\nVistra also believes the combination creates the opportunity to drive substantial value for shareholders through the anticipated realization of projected EBITDA and after-tax free cash flow value levers and tax synergies. Based on further, in-depth diligence undertaken since the merger was announced, Vistra is increasing its previously communicated adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, and tax synergy value lever targets, as reflected in the table below.\n($ in millions)\nOct. 2017\nEstimate\nMay 2018\nEstimate\nIncrease\nAdjusted EBITDA Value Levers\n$\n350\n$\n500\n$\n150\nAfter-Tax Adj.

Vistra's 2018 guidance reflects earnings and cash flow expectations of Vistra on a stand-alone basis for the period prior to April 9, 2018 and earnings and cash flow expectations on a combined-company basis for the period from April 9 through Dec. 31, 2018. The guidance assumes power price curves as of March 30, 2018 in all markets.\nThe combined company is projected to convert approximately 60 percent of its ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow on an annual basis, which far exceeds other commodity-based, capital-intensive industries, affording Vistra a broad range of capital allocation alternatives, including the potential to return capital to shareholders.\nVistra Energy Guidance\n($ in millions)\n2018E\n2019E\nOngoing Operations Adjusted EBITDA 3\n$\n2,700 – 2,900\n$\n3,200 – 3,500\nOngoing Operations Adjusted Free Cash Flow 3\n$\n1,400 – 1,600\n$\n2,050 – 2,350\n3 Excludes results from the Asset Closure Segment.

The 2019 illustrative guidance is pro forma for the full run-rate of value levers, providing a view of the potential earnings power of the combined company after all targeted merger value levers are realized.

Odessa Earnout Buyback 5\n$\n284\n$\n285\n6 Ongoing Operations includes Wholesale Generation, Retail Electricity, and Corporate and Other. It excludes the Asset Closure segment.\nVistra reported a net loss from its ongoing operations of $284 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to net income from its ongoing operations of $91 of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by $426 million of unrealized losses on wholesale hedge positions in 2018, reflecting sharply rising ERCOT forward power prices due principally to higher market heat rates.\nVistra reported adjusted EBITDA from its ongoing operations of $263 of 2018, exceeding expectations embedded in Vistra's stand-alone earnings guidance, versus $285 of 2017. The decrease was driven predominantly by a $21 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA related to Vistra's partial buyback of the Odessa Power Plant earnout for a three-year period, which is expected to generate an approximately $3 million and $23 million adjusted EBITDA benefit (net of the premium paid) for Vistra in 2018 and in the aggregate over the next three years, respectively. Operating and maintenance expenses were higher quarter over quarter as a result of outage expense timing. These impacts were partially offset by higher adjusted EBITDA from the retail segment due to favorable weather and lower SG&A expenses versus the first quarter of 2017.\nSegment Results:\nTable 1: Net Income / (Loss)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nRetail\n$\n771\n$\n(113)\nWholesale 7\n$\n(1,086)\n$\n303\nCorporate / Other\n$\n31\n$\n(99)\nOngoing Operations\n(284)\n91\nAsset Closure 7\n$\n(22)\n$\n(13)\nTotal\n$\n(306)\n$\n78\nTable 2: Adjusted EBITDA\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nRetail\n$\n194\n$\n177\nWholesale 7\n$\n70\n$\n105\nCorporate\n$\n(1)\n$\n3\nOngoing Operations\n263\n285\nAsset Closure 7\n$\n(22)\n$\n(9)\nTotal\n$\n241\n$\n276\n7 In accordance with GAAP, 2017 results have been recast to reflect the introduction of the Asset Closure segment.\nRetail: First quarter net income was $771 million, $884 million higher than first quarter 2017 results primarily due to unrealized gains on hedge positions with Vistra's wholesale segment driven by sharply rising ERCOT forward prices principally driven by higher market heat rates. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $194 million for the first quarter 2018 compared to $177 million during the same period in 2017, with the increase driven by comparatively favorable weather and lower SG&A expenses.\nWholesale: First quarter net loss was $1,086 million, $1,389 million lower than first quarter 2017 results primarily driven by unrealized losses of $1,069 million on wholesale positions with both retail affiliates and third-parties caused by sharply rising ERCOT forward power prices principally driven by higher market heat rates. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $70 million for the first quarter 2018 compared to $105 million during the same period in 2017 with the decrease driven by outage expense timing, as well as a $21 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA in February 2018 related to Vistra's partial buyback of the Odessa Power Plant earnout, which is expected to generate a $3 million and $23 million adjusted EBITDA benefit (net of the premium paid) for Vistra in 2018 and in the aggregate over the next three years, respectively. The partial buyback had a minimal impact on net income as the earnout is marked to market for GAAP reporting.\nAsset Closure: First quarter net loss was $22 million, compared to a net loss of $13 of 2017, and first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $(22) million compared to $(9) million during the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower contribution from assets that were retired throughout but were generating revenues for the entire first quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity ($ in millions)\n3/31/2018\n(Pro forma for\nmerger close)\n3/31/2018\n(Vistra\nstand-alone)\nCash\n$\n939\n$\n1,379\nRevolver Availability\n$\n1,495\n$\n584\nTerm Loan C Availability\n$\n18\n$\n18\nTotal\n$\n2,452\n$\n1,981\nAs of March 31, 2018, on a stand-alone basis, Vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $1.981 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.379 billion, $18 million in available letter of credit capacity under its term loan C facility, and $584 million of availability under its revolving credit facility, which remained undrawn but had $276 million of letters of credit outstanding as of March 31, 2018.\nAssuming the merger had closed on March 31, 2018 and that Vistra utilized $864 million of cash to pay the principal and redemption premium for the remaining $850 million of legacy Dynegy 6.75% notes due November 2019, Vistra on a combined-company basis would have had approximately $2.452 billion of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $939 million, $18 million in available letter of credit capacity under its term loan C facility, and $1,495 million of combined availability under its revolving credit facilities, which remained undrawn but had a cumulative $910 million of letters of credit outstanding as of March 31, 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nVistra will host a conference call today, May 4, 2018, beginning at 8 a.m. EDT (7 a.m. CDT) to discuss these results and related matters. The live, listen-only webcast of the conference call and the accompanying slides that will be discussed on the call can be accessed via the investor relations section of Vistra's website at www.vistraenergy.com . A replay of the call will be available on the Vistra website for one year following the live event.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Items Affecting Comparability\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" (EBITDA as adjusted for unrealized gains or losses from hedging activities, tax receivable agreement obligations, reorganization items, and certain other items described from time to time in Vistra Energy's earnings releases),\"adjusted free cash flow\" (cash from operating activities excluding changes in margin deposits and working capital and adjusted for capital expenditures, other net investment activities, preferred stock dividends, and other items described from time to time in Vistra Energy's earnings releases), \"Ongoing Operations Adjusted EBITDA\" (adjusted EBITDA less adjusted EBITDA from new Asset Closure segment) and \"Ongoing Operations Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" (adjusted free cash flow less cash flow from operating activities from new Asset Closure segment), are \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in Vistra Energy's consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Vistra Energy's non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nVistra Energy uses adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance and believes that analysis of its business by external users is enhanced by visibility to both net income prepared in accordance with GAAP and adjusted EBITDA. Vistra Energy uses adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity and believes that analysis of its ability to service its cash obligations is supported by disclosure of both cash provided by (used in) operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as adjusted free cash flow. Vistra Energy uses Ongoing Operations Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance and Ongoing Operations Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a measure of liquidity and Vistra Energy's management and board of directors have found it informative to view the Asset Closure segment as separate and distinct from Vistra Energy's ongoing operations. The schedules attached to this earnings release reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nMedia\nAllan Koenig\n214-875-8004\nMedia.Relations@vistraenergy.com\nAnalysts\nMolly Sorg\n214-812-0046\nInvestor@vistraenergy.com\nAbout Vistra Energy\nVistra Energy (NYSE: VST) is a premier, integrated power company based in Irving, Texas, combining an innovative, customer-centric approach to retail with a focus on safe, reliable, and efficient power generation.
