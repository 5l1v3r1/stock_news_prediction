In the 1990s it obtained a waiver for the South Pars 2 and 3 projects after the imposition of U.S. sanctions at the time.\nIt argued then, as it might do now, that it made its investment at a time sanctions were not in place.\nPouyanne said that Total has been lobbying the French government and other European capitals to obtain such a waiver again and protect its investments in Iran.\nTotal has a 50.1 percent stake in the $5 billion South Pars 11 project. Terms of the partnership show it is committed to investing an initial $1 billion to get the project off the ground and a further billion to develop the project.\nSources say it has already spent several tens of millions of dollars on studies and tenders.\nChina’s CNPC has a 30 percent stake in the project, while the Iran’s national oil company’s subsidiary PetroPars holds the remaining 19.9 percent.\nIf Total were to fail in an eventual attempt to obtain a waiver, the company is expected to take a backseat and allow CNPC to become lead operator, according to people with knowledge of the deal.\nTotal has previously expressed its commitment to Iran and desire to press ahead with the project as long as it can find a way to continue operating legally in the country.\nReporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Richard Lough Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:32:32.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
