It has since announced plans to move to a single policy rate, something long sought by investors.\nStill, the market remain cautious. Ratings agency Moody’s on Wednesday slashed its forecast for Turkey’s 2018 economic growth to 2.5 percent from 4 percent previously, citing the sell-off in the lira and the impact of double-digit inflation on growth.\n“There was the rate hike last week and this week they announced the central bank would simplify its policy framework,” said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB.\n“This suggests the central bank will be more autonomous when it sets interest rates and monetary policy – it could change in future but for now it signals the central bank will be more independent and that’s very good news for the lira.”\nThe lira was at 4.4930 to the dollar at 0812 GMT, firming some 1 percent and not far off its firmest since May 18. Last week it hit a record low of 4.9290, prompting the emergency move by the central bank.\nThe main stock index was little changed.\nDeputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and Turkish Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya met with investors in London on Tuesday.\nAt the meetings they dialled back on Erdogan’s combative messages on interest rate policy and insisted the central bank has freedom to defend the lira, according to investors who met them.\nOn Wednesday Simsek said on Twitter that the meetings were “beneficial” and that Turkey would prioritise the fight against inflation and the current account deficit.\nSeparately, official data showed that the economic confidence index fell to 93.5 points in May, further easing from a five-month high in January.
