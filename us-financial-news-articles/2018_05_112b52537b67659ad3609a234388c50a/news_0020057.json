Lundin declined to comment further.\n“We feel this is a pretty fair offer,” Horvat said, adding that Lundin’s management has a strong track record.\nToronto-based Lundin produces copper, zinc and nickel from mines in Americas, Portugal and Sweden. It tried in May 2016 to buy a stake in the Timok project.\nEuro Sun is a small non-producing company with a gold project in Romania. It is part of mining promoter Stan Bharti’s asset portfolio.\nLundin was given exclusive month-long access to Nevsun’s data and the CEOs have held repeated meetings on the understanding that Lundin would make a fair-priced, cash-and-share bid, according to Nevsun CEO Peter Kukielski.\n“To this day they have failed to deliver,” he said in an interview.\nIf Lundin made a formal bid, Kukielski said, Nevsun would consider running a full sales process for the company.\nBut Nevsun said in a statement that Euro Sun was “not an attractive partner,” and has had difficulty raising financing.\nNevsun’s shares last traded 15 percent higher at C$4.41 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Lundin’s shares were 2.7 percent weaker at C$8.02 and Euro Sun’s were unchanged at C$1.37.\n($1 = 1.2967 Canadian dollars)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T17:24:01.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
