They want the CMA to fast track to a “phase 2” examination so that the deal can be completed in the second half of 2019.\nCompetition lawyers say Sainsbury’s and Asda face an uphill battle to get the bid passed by the CMA without having to sell off so many stores that it removes the rationale for the deal.\nSainsbury’s and Asda have expressed confidence the CMA will not insist on mass store disposals but have declined to say how many would make the deal unattractive.\nHowever, a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters a figure “into the hundreds” would likely kill the deal.
