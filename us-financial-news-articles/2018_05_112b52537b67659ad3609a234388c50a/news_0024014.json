We are still on the ground,” he told Reuters.\nNakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui said on Twitter that another 40 people were reported missing and a decision had been made to discharge water from another nearby dam as a precaution.\nAfter a severe drought last year, East Africa has been hit by two months of heavy rain, affecting nearly a million people in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda. Bridges have been swept away and roads turned into rivers of mud.\nIn Solai, Veronica Wanjiku Ngigi, 67, said she was at home brewing tea with her son at about 8 pm (1700 GMT) when his wife rushed in to say the dam had burst and they needed to get to higher ground immediately.\n“It was a sea of water. My neighbor was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house. He was blind, so he could not run. They found his body in the morning,” she said. “My other neighbors also died. All our houses have been ruined.”\nA child walks in his house, which was partly destroyed by flooding water after a dam burst, in Solio town near Nakuru, Kenya. REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya BOULDERS, ROOTS Nakuru lies in the heart of Kenya’s fertile Rift Valley, home to thousands of commercial farms that grow everything from French beans to macadamia nuts to cut flowers, nearly all of which are exported to Europe.\nThe region is dotted with irrigation reservoirs built in the last two decades to meet the demands of the rapidly expanding agricultural sector, the biggest foreign exchange earner for East Africa’s largest economy and a major source of jobs.\nVinoj Kumar, general manager of the Solai farm, blamed the disaster on massive rainfall in a forest above the dam.\n“In the past two days the intensity of the rain was high and the water started coming down carrying boulders and roots which damaged the wall,” he told Reuters. “The dam wall cracked and the water escaped.”\nGovernor Kinyanjui said 450 homes had been hit by the floodwaters and safety engineers had been sent to inspect three other dams to check for cracks or breaches.\nWanjiku, the survivor, said at least one looked like it was ready to burst. “There is another dam which is also overflowing which is looking risky,” she said. “We are scared.”\nOne primary school had been closed as a precaution, education officials said. Arriving at the scene, Interior Minister Fred Matiangi pledged central government assistance to those affected.\nTo date, heavy rains have caused havoc in Kenya, killing at least 158 people and displacing 299,859, according to the government and Kenya Red Cross. Roads and bridges have been destroyed, causing millions of dollars of damage.\nThe U.N. disaster agency UNOCHA said 580,000 people had been affected by torrential rain and flooding in neighboring Somalia, while the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia had also taken a hammering, with 160,000 people affected.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The flooding could yet get worse, with heavy rains forecast to continue in the Rift Valley and the Lake Victoria basin over the next few weeks.\nReporting by Thomas Mukoya, George Obulutsa, Duncan Miriri, Humphrey Malalo and Maggie Fick; Writing by Ed Cropley, Editing by Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T08:53:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
