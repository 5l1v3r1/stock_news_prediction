West Virginia expects to collect about $4.24 billion by June 30, a record amount for the state.\nJustice and top state finance officials discussed the revenue increase at a press conference ahead of the state’s $800 million worth of general obligation bond sales expected later this month.\nFitch, on Friday, was the first major credit rating agency to rate the bonds, giving them a AA score. At the same time, Fitch improved its outlook on West Virginia to stable from negative, where the state has lingered for roughly two years.\nWest Virginia continues to struggle with population loss, per capita income 75 percent less than the U.S. average and volatility in its critical industries of coal and gas, Fitch said in its rating.\nStill, it has managed a recent modest improvement.\nThe revised outlook reflects “recent stability in key revenue sources, the state’s proactive management of financial operations ... improved expenditure controls for its Medicaid program, as well as modestly stabilizing economic indicators,” Fitch wrote.\nThe series 2018A bonds are due to price on May 21 and the series 2018B bonds are expected to come to market on May 23.
