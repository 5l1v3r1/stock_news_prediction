In fact, our net product sales in 2018 grew 91% over the same period last year and reached over $10 million in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. As we continue our efforts to take a greater share of the ADHD market, we are very pleased to report that we have now completed the transition of bringing our sales force in house as Neos employees, thereby gaining cost and operating efficiencies,” said Vipin K. Garg, Ph.D., President and CEO of Neos Therapeutics. “With the February launch of Adzenys ER™, we are focused on the commercial success of all three products as well as developing our pipeline using our high-value proprietary modified-release drug delivery technology.”\nCommercial Product Highlights as Reported by IQVIA\nNeos’ three commercial Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) products are Adzenys XR-ODT ® , Cotempla XR-ODT ® and Adzenys ER™ which launched in May 2016, September 2017 and February 2018, respectively. In order to most accurately represent the number of prescriptions filled, going forward the company will be utilizing cumulative TRx numbers verses EUTRx (Extended Units), which was formerly used and based on dispensed pills.\nCumulative TRx (1Q18) Cumulative TRx (1Q17) Year-over-year increase Cumulative TRx since launch\n(as of 4/27/18) Patients switching from another medication\n(as of 4/20/18) Adzenys XR-ODT ® 60,334 31,122 93.9 % 288,405 71 % Cotempla XR-ODT ® 32,829 N/A N/A 55,096 77 % TOTAL 93,163 31,122 199.3 % 343,501 N/A Additional Commercial Product Highlights as Reported by IQVIA\nPrescription Trends for Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT Continuing to Grow: The cumulative total number of TRx combined for the two XR-ODT products, Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT, were 93,163 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 33.6% over the 69,745 for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
