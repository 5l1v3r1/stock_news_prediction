REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo\nThe German industrial company is targeting savings of several hundred million euros in the programme, which follows plummeting demand and a switch to renewable energy.\nIn November, Siemens said it would cut 6,900 jobs worldwide, mainly at the PG division, which once thrived on supplying turbines for electricity generation. Around 3,400 of the jobs will go in Germany.\nConcrete details of the deal will now be negotiated in the coming months in Germany, Siemens said. Although the company was seeking voluntary job cuts, compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out, it said.\nExcluding its services business, the PG division has around 30,000 employees worldwide, of which 12,000 are based in Germany.\nThe cuts are separate to the temporary shutdown at PG sites around the world reported by Reuters on Monday.\nAround 30,000 workers globally will be affected by the week-long shutdown, which will take place in either May and June.
