That was our reference,” she added.\nThe Commission said the proposal, which still needs to be approved by the European Parliament and member states, could generate some 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of net additional sales per year.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:42:20.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
