(NASDAQ:PESI) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 financial highlights:\nGross profit increases to $3.3 million versus $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 Gross margin increases 480 basis points to 26.2% Reports net income attributable to common stockholders of $136,000 or $0.01 per share versus net loss of $727,000 or ($0.06) per share, for the same period in 2017 Waste treatment backlog increases 34% versus the same period last year Achieves Adjusted EBITDA (defined below) of $789,000\nMark Duff, President and CEO of the Company, commented, “I am pleased to report we achieved profitability for the first quarter of 2018, which reflects the success of our efforts to streamline operations while broadening our market base in both segments. Our revenue remained unchanged over Q1 2017 due to stability in our Services Segment, and strong backlog at our treatment facilities as we entered the first quarter. We continue to see our backlog grow within the Treatment Segment, which we believe provides us good visibility into the second quarter and second half of the year. We are further encouraged by the improved budget within the Department of Energy as well as defense clients that are beginning to move more waste while initiating remediation activities. As a result, we expect a solid year in our Treatment Segment. Within the Services Segment, this was an active quarter for project bids with several new proposal submittals, which we believe will provide potential for increased field projects this summer. Recent initiatives to increase efficiency at our treatment facilities coupled with reduced costs from closure of the M&EC facility, resulted in an improvement in both gross profit, and an increase in gross margin of more than 480 basis points. Accordingly, we generated $789,000 of adjusted EBITDA and achieved positive net income attributable to common shareholders.”\n“Looking ahead, we continue to expand our offering, and are actively pursuing new opportunities that we believe will help drive growth and further diversify our revenues. The expansion initiatives at each of our treatment facilities should come on line in the third quarter, which we expect will help to further enhance our offering to clients and increase the addressable market.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue was $12.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 2018. Revenue from the Services Segment increased $1.0 million to $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $2.7 million for the same period in 2017. Revenue for the Treatment Segment decreased to $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $10.0 million for the same period in 2017 primarily from decreased waste volume.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.3 million versus $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher revenue in the Services Segment. Gross margin increased to 26.2% from 21.4% for the same period last year primarily due to higher revenue achieved within our Services Segment and the reduction in our fixed costs in our Treatment Segment.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $317,000 versus operating loss of $520,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $136,000 or $0.01 per share versus net loss of $727,000 or ($0.06) per share, for the same period in 2017.\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $789,000 from continuing operations at March 31, 2018, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $835,000 from continuing operations during the corresponding period of 2017. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before research and development costs related to the Medical Isotope project. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful by enhancing the readers’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The Company’s management utilizes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as means to measure performance. The Company’s measurements of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar titled measures reported by other companies. The table below reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP measures, to GAAP numbers for income (loss) from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nQuarter Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 253 $ (675 ) Adjustments: Depreciation & amortization 372 1,155 Interest income (49 ) (35 ) Interest expense 53 100 Interest expense - financing fees 9 9 Income tax expense 51 81 EBITDA $ 689 $ 635 Research and development costs related to Medical Isotope project 100 200 Adjusted EBITDA $ 789 $ 835 The tables below present certain unaudited financial information for the business segments, which excludes allocation of corporate expenses:\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (In thousands) Treatment Services Medical Treatment Services Medical Revenues $ 8,959 $ 3,699 $ — $ 10,034 $ 2,673 $ — Gross profit 2,780 541 — 2,687 32 — Segment profit (loss) 1,693 (86 ) (100 ) 1,522 (707 ) (200 ) Conference Call\nPerma-Fix will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, May 9, 2018.
