Another official said more than 200 families had been evacuated from their villages.\nBadi urged a Saudi-led military coalition and international organizations to provide urgent aid to the island.\nThe Western-backed alliance intervened against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen in 2015 to restore the government of Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Saudi and UAE forces have a presence on Socotra island.\nThe storm is expected to hit southern Yemen and the coast of neighboring Oman on Thursday, Oman’s state news agency reported. It said Omani authorities evacuated hospitals in Dhofar province and other areas bordering Yemen.\nYemen is already grappling with the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced three million and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation, according to the United Nations.\nA tropical cyclone hit the Horn of Africa on Wednesday, killing more than 50 people in Somaliland.
