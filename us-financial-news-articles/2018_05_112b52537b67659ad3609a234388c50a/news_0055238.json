This vision Jobs had lead to what would be desktop publishing on the Macintosh computer, says Sculley.\nAlso important to Jobs was the process of zooming in, according Sculley. Zooming in is the process of finding elegant, intuitive solutions to these newly identified industries.\n“Steve would say that simplification is the ultimate sophistication, meaning that once you know how the dots connect, even if it cuts across industries that previously had never had a connection with one another, then you have to simplify it and make the solution so simple that even non-technical people will be able to use your tools and will be able to be motivated to do amazing things with them,” says Sculley.\nFor example, when Apple was developing desktop publishing, Jobs rejected a section of code for the “ point-and-click ” capability from an engineer who had been up for almost 24 hours working because it wasn’t simple enough.\n“He said, ‘Steve, I have got it down to five steps, let me show you.’ Steve replied, ‘I won’t look at it until you get it down to three steps.’ He sent the engineer away without looking at the demo,” Sculley says.\n“And that was his great skill, zooming out and zooming in,” says Sculley.
