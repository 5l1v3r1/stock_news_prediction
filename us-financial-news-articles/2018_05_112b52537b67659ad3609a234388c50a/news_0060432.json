For a lot of players, (the fact) that they are in... a Grand Slam, and have a physical problem in that week, just playing the tournament helps a lot to save the year.” Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T22:32:29.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
