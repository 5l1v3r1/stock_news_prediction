But when Nick Kyrgios pulled out of the main draw on Sunday and the next standby player, India’s Prajnesh Gunneswaran, was unable to take part because he was already entered in the draw for a low-key event in Vicenza, Trungelliti was on the clock.\nHe loaded up his car with brother Andre, mother Susi and grandmother Lela – and all his tennis gear and headed north to the French capital.\nThe long-haired 28-year-old looked good value for his win over Tomic, and will next face either Marco Cecchinato or Marius Copil.\nTrungelliti has the air of a man on a mission, and with better preparation for that second round match his family might well consider extending their trip to take in a most unlikely chapter.\nThe smile on his face as he clinched victory, and the grin and thumbs-up gestures he waved around the court as he left the arena showed this is one tennis player who is intent on making the most of a second chance.
