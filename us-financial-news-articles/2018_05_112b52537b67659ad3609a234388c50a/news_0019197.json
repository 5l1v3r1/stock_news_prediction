(Nasdaq:PRTO), a company developing novel, first-in-class therapeutics to address the medical needs of patients with kidney and vascular diseases, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and recent business highlights.\n“I am pleased by our team’s many accomplishments in the first quarter of 2018, which keep Proteon on track for a potential BLA filing in 2019,” said Timothy Noyes, President and Chief Executive Officer of Proteon. “Most importantly, we completed enrollment in PATENCY-2, our ongoing Phase 3 trial of vonapanitase. We also completed our drug substance process validation runs at Lonza’s facility in Visp, Switzerland, and executed a long term contract extension with Lonza for the commercial supply of vonapanitase, an agreement that we believe reflects the strength of our relationship with Lonza and the robustness of our manufacturing process.”\nRecent Highlights for 2018\nEnrollment completed in PATENCY-2, the second Phase 3 clinical trial of investigational vonapanitase, in March 2018. PATENCY-2 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that treated 603 patients in the United States and Canada with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. The study’s co-primary endpoints are fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency (i.e., time to fistula abandonment), each of which demonstrated improvements in PATENCY-1 using the same definitions as in PATENCY-2. The Company expects to report top-line data from PATENCY-2 in March 2019. If PATENCY-2 is successful in showing statistical significance (p≤0.05) on each of the co-primary endpoints, Proteon expects to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2019 and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020.\nSuccessful completion of the three drug substance validation runs . The Company manufactured three batches of vonapanitase’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the second half of 2017, each of which met the intended release specifications in the first quarter of 2018. The Company expects to include documentation of the manufacturing process and results from these validation runs in a potential BLA filing in the second half of 2019 if positive topline data from the PATENCY-2 trial is released earlier in 2019. The API manufacturing campaign was validated at commercial scale at Lonza Ltd.’s facility in Visp, Switzerland.\nImportant amendment to the supply agreement with Lonza was signed, securing a potential long term commercial supply of API for vonapanitase. Lonza has manufactured API for Proteon at its microbial manufacturing facility in Visp, Switzerland since 2009. The amendment extends the term of the supply agreement until 2029.\nEnrollment continues in a Phase 1 clinical trial of vonapanitase in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 dose escalation trial is expected to enroll 24 symptomatic PAD patients being treated with balloon angioplasty of an artery below the knee and to follow each patient for up to seven months. Immediately following successful angioplasty, vonapanitase or placebo is delivered to the arterial wall using the Mercator MedSystems Bullfrog® Micro-Infusion Catheter. The primary outcome measure of the trial is safety and the secondary outcome measure is technical feasibility of study drug delivery via the catheter.\nKey Milestones\nComplete enrollment of 24 patients in the PAD Phase 1 trial by the fourth quarter of 2018.\nRelease top-line data from PATENCY-2 in March 2019.\nUpcoming Events\nPresentation at the JMP Securities Life Science Conference June 20-21 in New York City, NY.\nPresentation by Keith Ozaki, M.D., at the Vascular Access Society of Americas (VASA) on May 12 th in New Orleans, Keith Ozaki M.D.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments totaled $36.8 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $42.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by operational costs for the first three-month period of 2018.\nR&D expenses: Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $4.1 million as compared to $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in R&D expenses was due primarily to decreased personnel expenses in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nMG&A expenses: Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.3 million as compared to $2.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in MG&A expenses was due primarily to higher overhead and personnel expenses in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss: Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.1 million as compared to $6.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss included stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 and $0.8 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial guidance: The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments will be sufficient to fund its operations into the fourth quarter of 2019, based on the Company’s current operating plan.\nAbout Vonapanitase\nVonapanitase is an investigational drug intended to improve hemodialysis vascular access outcomes. Vonapanitase is applied in a single administration and is currently being studied in a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. Vonapanitase has received Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA, and Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Commission, for hemodialysis vascular access indications. In addition, vonapanitase may have other surgical and endovascular applications in diseases or conditions in which vessel injury leads to blockages in blood vessels and reduced blood flow. Proteon is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of vonapanitase in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).\nAbout Proteon Therapeutics\nProteon Therapeutics is committed to improving the health of patients with kidney and vascular diseases through the development of novel, first-in-class therapeutics. Proteon's lead product candidate, vonapanitase, is an investigational drug intended to improve hemodialysis vascular access outcomes. Proteon is evaluating vonapanitase in patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula. Proteon is also evaluating vonapanitase in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with PAD.
