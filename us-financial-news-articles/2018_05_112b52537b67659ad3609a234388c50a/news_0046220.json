At this time, we are comfortable announcing that we do intend to apply for a Name Change and Ticker Symbol Change with the State of Nevada and FINRA, to some extent we do not control the outcome of these efforts, but we believe we have done the proper steps to be successful barring any unknown issues that may arise.
