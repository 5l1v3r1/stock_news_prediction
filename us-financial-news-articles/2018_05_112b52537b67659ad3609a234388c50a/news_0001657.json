(Nasdaq:LXRX), today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and highlighted progress with the company’s first commercial product, XERMELO ® (telotristat ethyl), its pipeline drug candidates and its overall business. The company will conduct a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 am EDT / 7:00 am CDT to discuss the financial results and to provide a business update.\n“Although we are treating more people affected with carcinoid syndrome diarrhea than ever before, we still have much work to do,” said Lonnel Coats, Lexicon’s president and chief executive officer. “We continue to position the company for future growth and to build long-term sustainable value for shareholders. As such, we are excited about exploring the investigational use of telotristat ethyl in oncology indications this year. For sotagliflozin, we are a step closer to making the therapy available to people with type 1 diabetes, with the recent regulatory submissions in the U.S. and in Europe and the European Medicines Agency’s acceptance of the filing in Europe. Finally, we look forward to reporting clinical data later this year from our earlier-stage product candidates, LX2761 and LX9211, in diabetes and neuropathic pain, respectively, which we believe will create long-term value for the company.”\nFirst Quarter Product and Pipeline Highlights\nXERMELO (telotristat ethyl) 250 mg\nData from a poster highlighting time to sustained improvement in bowel movement frequency with XERMELO were presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO GI; San Francisco) in January.\nSotagliflozin\nLexicon’s collaborator Sanofi submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March for sotagliflozin, for use in combination with insulin therapy to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

XERMELO targets tryptophan hydroxylase, an enzyme that mediates the excess serotonin production within metastatic neuroendocrine tumor (mNET) cells. Lexicon has built the in-house capability and infrastructure to launch and market XERMELO in the U.S., where it retains all commercialization rights. Lexicon also retains rights to market XERMELO in Japan. Lexicon has established a license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen to commercialize XERMELO in Europe and other countries outside of U.S. and Japan.\nXERMELO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on February 28, 2017 and by the European Commission on September 19, 2017 for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with SSA therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. Carcinoid syndrome is a rare condition that occurs in patients living with metastatic NETs (mNETs) and is characterized by frequent and debilitating diarrhea. XERMELO targets the overproduction of serotonin inside mNET cells, providing an additional treatment option for patients suffering from carcinoid syndrome diarrhea.\nXERMELO ( telotristat ethyl) Important Safety Information\nWarnings and Precautions: XERMELO may cause constipation, which can be serious. Monitor for signs and symptoms of constipation and/or severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain in patients taking XERMELO. Discontinue XERMELO if severe constipation or severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain develops. Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) include nausea, headache, increased gamma-glutamyl-transferase, depression, flatulence, decreased appetite, peripheral edema, and pyrexia. Drug Interactions: If necessary, consider increasing the dose of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates, as XERMELO may decrease their systemic exposure. If combination treatment with XERMELO and short-acting octreotide is needed, administer short-acting octreotide at least 30 minutes after administering XERMELO.\nFor more information about XERMELO, see Full Prescribing Information at www.xermelo.com .\nAbout Lexicon Pharmaceuticals\nLexicon is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is applying a unique approach to gene science based on Nobel Prize-winning technology to discover and develop precise medicines for patients with serious, chronic conditions.
