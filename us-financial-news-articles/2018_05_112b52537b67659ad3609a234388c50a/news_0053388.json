Over time, many other antiquated auto features have been ruthlessly abandoned—hand-crank starters and windows, carburetors and cassette decks. But stick-shifting has defiantly stuck around, joining ax throwing, rock climbing and ultramarathons as an activity people stubbornly enjoy despite its needless difficulty. Drivers choose to shift because it is an ever-rarer skill that is a challenge to learn and—face it—fun to show off.\nWhile many car owners would love to kick back with a good book while the family minivan whisks their brood down the interstate, driving stick appeals to those who seek tangible experiences in an era of digital assistants and apps for just about everything. These die-hards fear that the car, long a symbol of freedom and spontaneity, is becoming just another numbing high-tech appliance. Meanwhile, vehicles that still offer stick shifts telegraph an image of high performance, toughness, nostalgia and fun—all factors that can seduce new customers.\nFiatChrysler redesigned its Jeep Wrangler for 2018 with the latest in electronic driver aids, including backup cameras and Tru-Loc locking differentials for tackling nearly any terrain. Still, the company kept stick as an option because it gives needy drivers a stronger sense of control, especially when they head off-road. It also helps maintain a link between new Jeeps and their beloved World War II ancestors. Even as they rush to develop vehicles that drive themselves, several other car makers still offer models with manual transmissions.\nMazda Motor Co. 7261 0.25% sells manual versions of its compact CX-5 SUV and its MX-5 Miata sports car (whose contractual obligation to thrill practically relies on a stick). German auto maker BMW offers sticks in its 2- and 3-Series cars, among its smallest models, and the company claims that roughly half of the more-powerful M2 models it sells go out the door with manual gearboxes installed. Muscle cars from the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro to imports like the Subaru WRX—in which Ansel Elgort famously used every gear including reverse to evade cops in last year’s sleeper-hit film “Baby Driver”—all come with sticks because people associate shifting with muscle flexing.\n‘ Driving stick is an ever-rarer skill that is a challenge to learn and—face it—fun to show off. ’\nOther vehicles have evolved to keep pace with automatic gearboxes while maintaining much of the back-to-basics appeal of driving stick. The seven-speed Chevrolet Corvette Stingray has a feature called Active Rev Matching, which automatically adjusts the engine’s speed to smooth out your clumsiest shifts—something drivers once had to learn through practice.\nFor all that, said Thomas Plucinsky, a company representative for BMW, “There is no longer a logical reason to shift manually.” Cars with automatic transmissions accelerate faster, drive more smoothly and get better fuel economy than stick shifts, he pointed out. One could argue that manually shifting a modern car makes about as much sense as milling your own flour, building a fire to heat your home or drawing water from a well. Even many pro drivers race automatics these days.\nThough fully automated cars aren’t yet a reality, the latest vehicles have largely advanced beyond the need for human intervention. They sound alarms when you drift from your lane on the highway, with many cars tut-tuttingly steering you back on course. They flash warning lights when other autos camp out in your blind spots, and hit the brakes to keep you from rear-ending neighbors or backing over your kids in the driveway because you were staring at your phone. Need to parallel park? Push a button.\nBut many people still buy stick shift cars for “emotional reasons,” Mr. Plucinsky said. “They enjoy the mechanical feedback, which is part of the fun of driving even if they are just commuting to work.”\nThere certainly is joy in changing gears in rhythm with the car. Some people get a tingle from the sound of the engine revving as they slide down into a lower gear while threading winding roads like Connecticut’s Merritt Parkway or the curvy section of U.S. Route 129 in North Carolina, known as the Tail of the Dragon. Taking on twisting, scenic routes in a nimble sports car with a manual transmission can feel like a masterful fox trot. Think of the opening in the original 1969 version of “The Italian Job,” in which a man drives a Lamborghini Miura along the Great St. Bernard Pass in the Alps that links Italy and Switzerland. Skip the part where it tumbles down the cliff.\nNot everyone agrees, of course. The appetite for shifting gears by hand first began to dim in the 1940s when automatic transmissions like the Oldsmobile Hydra-Matic started catching on among consumers. In 1965 celebrated auto writer Ken Purdy broke many sports-car fans’ hearts by opining that automatic transmissions were surpassing stick shifts and would soon push them into obsolescence. But the sticks are still here and car companies keep churning them out while updating other parts of their vehicles with the latest automation technology. Car makers will continue to woo customers with the promise of good times that come with manual transmissions. While not quite booming, the market for stick shift cars has a loyal, respectable following. Sticks accounted for around 5% of the more than 17 million new vehicles sold in the U.S. last year—which means well over half a million drivers were working the clutch on the way home from the dealer showroom.\nBMW’s Mr. Plucinsky said the number of people buying manual transmissions today makes it worthwhile for his company to keep building them. “This group of customers doesn’t appear to be shrinking,” he said.\nEven when self-driving cars reach the mass market, many drivers are likely to keep a secondary “analog” car that offers as much physical engagement as possible. It is no fun being asleep at the wheel, even when your new car is built for it.\nMore in Gear & Gadgets\nThe Nostalgic Appeal of Instant Cameras—and Why They’re Back May 24, 2018 Does Smart Luggage Really Make Travel Easier?
