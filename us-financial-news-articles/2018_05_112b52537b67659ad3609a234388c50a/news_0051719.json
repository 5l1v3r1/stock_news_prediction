Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index fell nearly 2 percent as shares of state-run power company Eletrobras tumbled after lawmakers torpedoed hopes for a privatization of the company in the near future. Globally, stocks suffered after Trump signaled a new direction in U.S.-China trade talks and said any deal would need \"a different structure,\" fueling uncertainty over current negotiations. Fears that a trade war between the world's top two economies could damage global growth have kept a lid on appetite for risky assets in recent months. In Mexico, stocks rose slightly for the second session in a row as the benchmark IPC index bounces back from a 1-1/2-year low. The Mexican peso strengthened about 1 percent after reports pointed towards movement on the renegotiation of NAFTA with Canada and the United States. Trump, who has threatened to scrap the trade pact, said on Wednesday that \"big news\" was coming for U.S. auto workers, suggesting a link to NAFTA talks. Auto trade has been one of the biggest obstacles in forging an update to the 24-year-old accord. Meanwhile, Mexican deputy economy minister Juan Carlos Baker has been in Washington this week to continue talks with U.S. officials, sources told Reuters. Analysts at Mexico's Banco Base said the news reports helped the peso, but warned the currency could face renewed pressure if NAFTA talks don't conclude in the coming weeks.
