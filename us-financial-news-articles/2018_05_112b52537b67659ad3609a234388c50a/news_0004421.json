The Singapore dollar and the Thai baht rose 0.25 percent and 0.15 percent respectively. The Indian rupee and the South Korean won also edged up on the day, the latter buoyed by an ongoing improvement of relations with North Korea.\nIn Latin America though there had been more gloomy news for turmoil-ridden Venezuela as the IMF issued a “declaration of censure” against Venezuela for failing to provide necessary economic data.\nThe United States cut off metals tariff talks with Brazil, contradicting an earlier U.S. announcement that the two countries had reached a permanent exemption from steel and aluminium import tariffs.\nRepresentatives for Brazil’s industry decried U.S. negotiation tactics, which the head of the association for aluminium producers, Milton Rego, called “Al Capone-like.”\n“You get better results by pointing a gun to the head,” he said.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see)\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-03T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:10:15.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
