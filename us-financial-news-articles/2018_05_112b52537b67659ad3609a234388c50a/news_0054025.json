I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\"\nABC, which broadcasts Barr's sitcom \"Roseanne,\" canceled the show later Tuesday , citing her tweet, calling it \"abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\"\nGetty Images Valerie Jarrett The tweet, which has since been removed from her feed, said: \"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj,\" referring to Jarrett.\nHere is a screenshot of the tweet taken before it was deleted:\nCritics immediately slammed Barr's remark as racist. Likening black people to apes is an attack commonly used by racists. The Muslim Brotherhood, meanwhile, is an Islamist political group.\nIn an earlier tweet, the actress appeared to defend her statement. \"ISLAM is not a RACE, lefties. Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\" she wrote.\nROSEANNE TWEET\nShe also defended her remark about Jarrett as a joke, in a tweet to a CNN reporter.\nJOKE TWEET\nThe actress also said that she would be leaving Twitter. Her account was still active as of publication.\nThe sitcom \"Roseanne\" returned to television this year after an initial run in the 1980s and '90s. Its recent premiere shattered ratings records , although it has faced criticism for racially tinged humor. ABC is owned by Disney .\nOn Tuesday, consulting producer Wanda Sykes, who is black, announced on Twitter that she would not be returning to the show. She did not provide a reason, and could not immediately be reached by CNBC.\nSYKES TWEET\nSara Gilbert, who plays the daughter of Barr's character on the show, said she was \"disappointed\" in the star and called her comments \"abhorrent.\"\nGILBERT TWEET\nBarr often makes politically charged and controversial statements on her Twitter feed. She is a supporter of President Donald Trump , who called her to congratulate her for the sitcom revival's high ratings.\n\"You can't control Roseanne Barr,\" Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, told The New York Times in March. \"Many who have tried have failed. She's the one and only.\"\nA representative for Jarrett declined to comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/roseanne-criticized-for-reductive-belittling-racial-joke.html", "https://twitter.com/THEsaragilbert/status/1001513801546530816", "https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2018/05/29/roseannevalerie.JPG", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roseanne-ratings-climb-hit-25-million-viewers-time-shifting-record-1098904", "https://twitter.com/therealroseanne/status/1001455548632481793", "https://twitter.com/iamwandasykes/status/1001494592649342979", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/business/media/roseanne-barr-offensive-tweets.html", "https://twitter.com/therealroseanne/status/1001462549101953025"], "published": "2018-05-29T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:22:42.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
