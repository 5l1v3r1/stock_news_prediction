(NASDAQ:MGNX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, today provided a corporate progress update and reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Our momentum continues to build in 2018, as our multiple product candidates advance toward data read-outs,” said Scott Koenig, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of MacroGenics. “During the first quarter, margetuximab passed an interim futility analysis for the SOPHIA Phase 3 metastatic breast cancer study. We also presented clinical data for the combination of margetuximab with an anti-PD-1 agent showing encouraging activity in the treatment of gastric cancer patients in a Phase 2 study. We plan to provide an update on this study, including presentation of biomarker data, at the upcoming ASCO meeting. During the second half of the year, we expect to provide clinical updates on both flotetuzumab in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and on the combination of enoblituzumab with an anti-PD-1 agent. In addition, we anticipate that two of our oncology product candidates will move into our clinical pipeline this year: MGD019 (PD-1 x CTLA-4 DART® molecule) and MGC018 (B7-H3 ADC), the planned investigational new drug (IND) application submissions for which are both on track.”\nKey Pipeline Updates\nMargetuximab. Recent highlights related to the Company’s Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, include:\nPhase 3 Metastatic Breast Cancer Study . The pivotal SOPHIA study is evaluating the efficacy of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in approximately 530 relapsed/refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. In January 2018, the Company announced the completion of a pre-planned interim futility analysis with the recommendation of an independent data safety monitoring committee to continue SOPHIA as planned without modification. This analysis was based on a pre-specified assessment of progression-free survival as determined by independent central review. The Company also announced that the U.S. FDA had granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of margetuximab for treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced HER2 positive breast cancer who have previously been treated with anti-HER2-targeted therapy. MacroGenics remains on track to complete enrollment of the study in the fourth quarter of 2018, with anticipated disclosure of topline progression-free survival data in the first half of 2019. Phase 2 Gastric Cancer Study . In January 2018, MacroGenics presented interim clinical data from a Phase 2 study of margetuximab plus an anti-PD-1 agent in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. These results included encouraging tolerability and anti-tumor activity in a subpopulation of 25 gastric cancer patients. Based on these results, MacroGenics expanded the study and is enrolling 25 additional gastric cancer patients. The Company will present updated clinical and biomarker data at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting in June.\nFlotetuzumab. Recent highlights of the Company’s bispecific, humanized DART molecule that recognizes both CD123 and CD3, include:\nMonotherapy Study . MacroGenics has completed the enrollment of its AML dose expansion cohort. The Company anticipates presenting updated clinical data and defining a potential registration path during the second half of 2018. The Company’s collaborator, Servier, has development and commercialization rights outside North America, Japan, Korea and India for flotetuzumab, also known as S80880. Planned Combination Study with an anti-PD-1 . MacroGenics has previously presented data supporting the rationale for using checkpoint blockade as an approach to potentially enhance the anti-leukemic activity of flotetuzumab. MacroGenics intends to initiate a combination study with INCMGA0012, an anti-PD-1 mAb also known as MGA012, during the third quarter of 2018.\nOther Pipeline Assets Update\nAdditional programs that the Company is advancing include the following:\nPD-1-Directed Immuno-Oncology Franchise. MacroGenics is advancing multiple PD-1-directed programs to enable both a broad set of combination opportunities across the Company’s portfolio and provide further differentiation from existing PD-1-based treatment options. These programs include:\nINCMGA0012 . INCMGA0012 is a humanized, proprietary anti-PD-1 mAb being developed for use as monotherapy as well as in combination with other potential cancer therapeutics. INCMGA0012 was licensed to Incyte Corporation in 2017 under a global collaboration and license agreement. MacroGenics transferred the INCMGA0012 U.S. IND to Incyte during the first quarter of 2018. MGD013. MacroGenics designed a DART molecule, MGD013, to provide co-blockade of two immune checkpoint molecules expressed on T cells, PD-1 and LAG-3, for the potential treatment of a range of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. MGD013 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose escalation study. MacroGenics expects to establish the dose and schedule for MGD013 administration as well as initiate dose expansion cohorts in the second half of 2018. MGD019. This DART molecule is designed to provide co-blockade of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T cells. The Company is completing IND-enabling studies and anticipates submitting the IND application for MGD019 in the second half of 2018.\nB7-H3 Franchise . MacroGenics is developing a portfolio of therapeutics that target B7-H3, a member of the B7 family of molecules involved in immune regulation. The Company is advancing multiple programs that target B7-H3 through complementary mechanisms of action that take advantage of this antigen's broad expression across multiple solid tumor types. These molecules include:\nEnoblituzumab : The Company completed the recruitment of patients with four solid tumor types in an ongoing study of this Fc-optimized mAb that targets B7-H3, in combination with an anti-PD-1 mAb and expects to present clinical data from this study in the second half of 2018. MGD009 : This DART molecule targeting B7-H3 and CD3 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 study across multiple solid tumor types. The Company expects to establish the dose and schedule for MGD009 administration as well as initiate monotherapy dose expansion cohorts in the second half of 2018. In addition, a combination study of MGD009 and INCMGA0012 was initiated during the first quarter of 2018. MGC018 : The Company is completing IND-enabling activities to support submission of an IND application for this anti-B7-H3 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and anticipates initiation of a Phase 1 study in the second half of 2018.\nAdditional DART Clinical Programs. Additional DART molecules in Phase 1 clinical development being led by MacroGenics include the following:\nMGD007. The Company recently completed a monotherapy study of MGD007, a DART molecule that recognizes gpA33 and CD3, and anticipates commencing a combination study with INCMGA0012 in the second quarter of 2018.
