The real assets are the players and the coaches and their support staff.”\nRaelene Castle, who took over as chief executive of Rugby Australia four months ago, issued her own lengthy “State of the Game” missive on Friday.\nThe New Zealander admitted there were challenges facing rugby and that “not all elements within the game are working in unison and our organisations are not aligned as effectively as they could be in their thinking or delivery”.\nThe former netball administrator said she was confident that a more coordinated approach to coaching, fitness and skills work over Australia’s four Super Rugby teams would soon bear fruit.\nAs for the grassroots, Castle was encouraged by projects which are exposing tens of thousands of state schoolchildren to the game and said she planned to build on this success by fostering relationships with existing clubs.\nCastle said Rugby Australia would not be ignoring the private schools which have traditionally provided a majority of elite players, some of which are reported to be turning to Australian Rules and rugby league.\n“We will work harder at developing and keeping our most talented players through the implementation of the national schools strategy and new contracting initiatives,” she concluded.\n“The challenges rugby faces are well documented and widely debated but I believe there is much to be positive about and many of the building blocks are in place to take these challenges head on.” (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Ian Ransom)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T06:15:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
