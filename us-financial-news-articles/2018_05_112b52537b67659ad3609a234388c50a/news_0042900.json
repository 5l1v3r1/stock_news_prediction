That's what causes our bullish view all the way coming in over the past year or two. That's what's causing us to say, how much can this go if we start really looking beyond the next three months?\" Gill said.\nPrices have risen recently amid concerns over the impact of potential U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil exports following a disputed election which saw Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro re-elected . Also, an executive order that prohibited U.S. citizens from participating in the sale of Venezuelan receivables linked to oil was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, Reuters reported.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 20 cents, or 0.28 percent, at $72.44 per barrel. International benchmark Brent crude futures were 13 cents, or 0.16 percent, higher at $79.35 during Asia afternoon trade on Tuesday.\nBrent had crossed the $80 mark last week for the first time since November 2014 .

Trump had announced that he was pulling U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this month.\nMore broadly, prices have firmed amid ongoing oil production cuts led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T09:44:18.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
