Atletico’s superior head-to-head record means they finish above Real for the first time since winning the title in 2014.\nVillarreal are fifth on 60, Betis sixth on 60 and Sevilla seventh on 55, three above Getafe and with a better head-to-head record than the Madrid side.\nChampions Barcelona, on 90 points, visit Levante on Sunday.\nBetis took the lead at home to fierce rivals Sevilla when defender Marc Bartra headed home from a free kick but the visiting side, who beat Real Madrid 3-2 on Wednesday, turned things around after the break with goals from Wissam ben Yedder and Simon Kjaer.\nBetis striker Loren bundled the ball in down the other end two minutes after Kjaer’s strike to lift the home fans again and ensure his side will not have to play three playoff rounds to get into the Europa League.\nVillarreal raced into a 3-0 lead in the first half at relegated Deportivo but it was cut by two goals before Russia international Denis Cheryshev struck in stoppage-time to give them a 4-2 win.
