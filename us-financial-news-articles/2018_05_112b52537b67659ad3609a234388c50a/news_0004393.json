However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s performance because it is commonly used financial analysis tools for measuring and comparing companies in the Company’s industry in areas of operating performance.\nManagement believes that the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA offers an additional view of the Company’s operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliation to GAAP net loss, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss from continuing operations before taxes plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) depreciation, (iii) amortization, and (iv) stock-based compensation. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation. Our presentation of these metrics should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nINUVO, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE TAXES TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 Loss from continuing operations before taxes $(1,415,669 ) $(1,691,945 ) Interest expense, net 100,889 42,944 Depreciation 438,185 328,054 Amortization 353,459 365,121 Stock-based compensation 377,847 292,334 Adjusted EBITDA $(145,289 ) $(663,492 ) Company Contact:\nInuvo, Inc.\nWally Ruiz, Chief Financial Officer\n501-205-8397\nwallace.ruiz@inuvo.com\nInvestor Contact:\nKCSA Strategic Communications\nValter Pinto, Managing Director\n212-896-1254\nvalter@kcsa.com\nSource:Inuvo Inc.", "external_links": ["http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129624", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KDne22OX7O9aUSTjMVVznPUpfMlFh7PYZb55g-RIV5q3dZt4uDK6lwVaaUPOADr-tyy5skuKyczfoz7VFA0S3JKdSvM81Hb4uYHOifnHpivBxSgauCXmufBVs06iKcl51xo6pzhu2LHGeXeO2yTeWM6q5cp-1z__qv8mrsbAXASGAWAwIKDgnDT3AeGYZ47vF0MqJqD1vy6r6eXOhnQtalgd0pS8PyiCeSlKlwdetLqjwlFsToJNqAWLy-VmmEm0HKp1sefRyo2CWNetN2gYAijXsx4Qqn91kZLDi4n4R-M=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/903acacb-bfd5-44e6-b66d-7c0e2ab2317b", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RdF5tjwkyoWMuMj65m7css5HnpLK02JLLnGZgrj3VSiKR9omaW1E3F37uRgCVuc0_dEs_HZS4qDk97KNNleE3xKt-Ht1wQw4D2U2wbKP7VjRusd783aycM9_6FeO7De5PDNbhueVs9G-4XIfumuCWw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Td7WuxOVGZ0SbfQ3GwxVZ2mYTPvPC7sGSlAWlLUlC24C_xq2jBfky82nQoa5WhhotD-Cv3ghVJIrZPbz11OlGuF8zeDfguwTtmKigf0iCdIx6drZTYhNysNFpN2HmBLXTUs1zaZlGwvEJxrX8CSUsBmebTdpr6FZlT3jKED_jOUl8Sn83CjSWXCcUdSkNPElDLZw3rn6nAFHMSLNRSTMbYd8OhV_ecCqTALLnE1TfLmMtO7P3oEosvZn4pf3ngwTJdD3v7Lg08BOHQcoNeFh9w==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tdl59LgyczAKcRKzywiOBWLTpWHis42gJX_uw9Ar6HcaFZx_FUtGY3K90qZ8dbp-bwSMMCZeZguryvw1cCWUyju8bzyG5katrzidb5A6mEzJ413G-cQJTKoh4fHGG-iyxh1DXdyShY1knV_FawHZJskWVdgbFz-HEvgn8sO3acH80ohM69B6OsBCeL2Q0QsOfVMJ3ye7yPJ6D9ShZVtQyNU5G3NE-kLCz5KjrQr_NA5TSSi3C8XkYnHStPJWv4CjvR8I-C885HwmbQ_XnnJ4Ba_v53h7JiHL6Z9WVmXwv0Ij3yqmGGwvbH57Rf8_zc5ihXWBYU-2RGE_KkAK_BsvGNQpKDKRxA5D9QDgsQ1dZ0b3_xV5jJBbaSSdF2NZ5Q9AVRqBnPNLA2DtmUukP5Krw5SmhGB35bZfBAnV81h21Lo="], "published": "2018-05-04T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T01:30:22.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
