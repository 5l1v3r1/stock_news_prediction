The letter of credit was issued from HSBC to Dutch lender ING .\nLetters of credit are issued by one bank to another to guarantee that a payment will be received by a seller under a set of conditions. Traditionally this process would take a large amount of time, numerous paper records, and a lot of back and forth between the various parties involved. Blockchain technology promises to change that.\nBlockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, enables transactions to be recorded across a vast network of computers. In the case of bitcoin, it records all of the transactions that happen on the network, creating a public ledger. Banks have taken the principles behind bitcoin's blockchain – such as the idea of decentralized ledger – and tried to apply it to processes that they are carrying out.\nFor this transaction, HSBC used a platform developed by blockchain start-up R3 called Corda. R3 works with a consortium of banks to come up with blockchain solutions to a variety of problems.\nshow chapters What is Blockchain? 7:14 AM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 | 04:44 \"The need for paper reconciliation is removed because all parties are linked on the platform and updates are instantaneous,\" Vivek Ramachandran, head of growth and innovation at HSBC, said in a statement. \"The quick turnaround could mean unlocking liquidity for businesses.\"\nHSBC and ING said that the exchange was performed in 24 hours, compared to the five-to-10 days it normally takes to complete such exchanges through a paper-based system.\nProponents of blockchain claim it has the potential to upend various industries.
