Six different players had at least two hits, including three each from Brad Miller and Mallex Smith. Daniel Robertson also homered for Tampa Bay.\nSnell followed up Chris Archer’s solid outing in the first game of the series on Thursday with one of his own. He held the Angels scoreless until Andrelton Simmons’ two-run single in the fifth.\nBut by that time, the Rays had already built a comfortable lead. Robertson hit his homer in the second inning off Angels starter Nick Tropeano. Ramos’ two-run homer and an RBI single by Smith made it 4-0 in the third.\nTropeano (1-3) didn’t made it out of the third inning. His night was over after throwing just 2 2/3 innings and allowing four runs and six hits. He walked three and struck out four.\nThe Rays made it 6-0 in the fifth on Ramos’ second homer of the night and an RBI single by Christian Arroyo.\nIt was more than enough against an Angels offense that has struggled of late. Before Simmons’ two-run single in the fifth, the Angels had scored just one run over their previous 26 innings.\nSnell (5-3) gave up two runs on four hits and three walks in his 6 2/3 innings. Snell, who struck out eight and threw 114 pitches, had not won in his previous three starts, going 0-2 with a no-decision since his last win on April 27.\nMike Trout hit his team-leading 13th home run of the season in the eighth inning, snapping an 0-for-21 slide. The Angels have now lost four in a row, matching their longest losing streak of the season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:24:08.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
