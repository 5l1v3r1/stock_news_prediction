But the biggest reason for sterling’s fall has been a drastic shift in market expectations of when the BoE will raise rates.\nRecent weak economic data mean markets are now not even pricing in a full 25-basis-point hike by the end of 2018. They had expected two 25 bp rises this year.\nConcerns over Brexit also continue to dog the pound.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday she would consider another vote on independence for Scotland when the British government offers some certainty over Brexit .\nAdding to the political uncertainty, Tory MPs reportedly are bracing themselves for a snap general election this autumn amid fears the Brexit deadlock will become insurmountable.\nIn notes to clients, analysts at CMC Markets and Commerzbank both predicted the pound would fall toward the $1.3300 level in the short term.
