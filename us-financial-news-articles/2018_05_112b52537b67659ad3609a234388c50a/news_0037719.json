A large cone of fries is displayed outside a fritkot or fries stand in Brussels, Belgium, May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\nBelgians take great pride in their fries, traditionally sold doused in mayonnaise and in a paper cone from so-called “fritkots”, shacks found near the larger squares and main avenues of the city.\nBut the stalls are not always as appealing as their produce.\n“Tourists may think ‘Well, actually, would I like to buy something there? It looks a bit shabby,’” said Thomas Hick, one of the architects that city authorities have asked to revamp the outlets.
