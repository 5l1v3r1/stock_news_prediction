REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo The Silicon Valley firm said in September it will stop using diesel cars in London by the end of 2019 and that the vast majority of rides will be in electric or hybrid vehicles by then.\n“In the coming weeks we’ll set out more details of our plan to get thousands of diesel cars off the road as we aim to go fully electric in London by 2025,” said Uber’s UK general manager Tom Elvidge.\nShortly after September’s diesel announcement, Uber was deemed unfit to run a taxi service by London’s regulator Transport for London (TfL) and was stripped of its licence.\nElvidge said the firm had made mistakes.\n“TfL’s decision soon became the latest wake-up call for a company that had grown incredibly quickly but still needed to grow up,” he added in a statement.\nIts appeal will be heard at the end of June.\nReporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:29:56.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
