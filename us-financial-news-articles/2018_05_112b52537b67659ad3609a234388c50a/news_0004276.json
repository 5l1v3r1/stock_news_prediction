So the Jewish issue that had spread against the Jews across Europe was not because of their religion, it was because of usury and banks.”\nIsraeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman swiftly rejected Abbas’ apology. He wrote on Twitter: “Abu Mazen is a wretched Holocaust denier, who wrote a doctorate of Holocaust denial and later also published a book on Holocaust denial. That is how he should be treated. His apologies are not accepted.”\nReacting to the speech, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday accused Abbas of grave anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper of the U.S.-based Jewish human rights organisation the Simon Wiesenthal Center said Abbas’ words were those of “a classic anti-Semite”.\nU.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov called Abbas’ comments “deeply disturbing”. Related Coverage Israeli defence minister rejects Abbas apology over remarks on Jews\nThe United States on Friday asked the U.N. Security Council to denounce the comments by Abbas as “unacceptable, deeply disturbing” and not in “the interests of the Palestinian people or peace in the Middle East.” Such statements have to be agreed by consensus. PREVIOUS COMMENTS\nA veteran member of Fatah, the PLO’s dominant faction, Abbas served for decades as a loyal deputy of his predecessor, Yasser Arafat. He assumed the leadership of Fatah, the PLO and the Palestinian Authority after Arafat died in 2004, and was re-elected as chairman of the PLO’s Executive Committee on Friday.\nIn 1982 Abbas obtained a doctorate in history at the Moscow Institute of Orientalism in the then-Soviet Union. His dissertation, entitled “The Secret Relationship between Nazism and the Zionist Movement” - to which Lieberman referred - drew widespread criticism from Jewish groups.\nThe following year the Simon Wiesenthal Center released translated quotations from the book, including one excerpt about World War Two in which, according to the centre’s translation, Abbas wrote:\n“Following the war ... word was spread that six million Jews were amongst the victims and that a war of extermination was aimed primarily at the Jews ... The truth is that no one can either confirm or deny this figure. In other words, it is possible that the number of Jewish victims reached six million, but at the same time it is possible that the figure is much smaller - below one million.”\nAfter Abbas’ speech on Monday, Hier and Cooper said: “The world can now see that see that, for Palestinian Authority President Abbas, nothing has changed in the 45 years since his doctoral dissertation was first published.”\nBut in his apology on Friday, Abbas said: “I would also like to reiterate our long held condemnation of the Holocaust, as the most heinous crime in history, and express our sympathy with its victims.
