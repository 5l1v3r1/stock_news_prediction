FILE PHOTO: 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio shakes hands with Giuseppe Conte during the presentation of the would-be cabinet team ahead of elections in Rome, March 1, 2018\nConte’s main achievements were always more academic than political but now the Sorbonne and New York University - two institutions at which Conte said he had “perfected” his law studies - have confirmed they cannot find any trace of him in their databases.\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella has indicated he needs a pause for reflection before deciding whether to appoint Conte; it is now up in the air whether he will take a decision on Wednesday.\nFrance’s unemployment rate edged up from 9 percent to 9.2 percent in the first quarter of the year, data showed this morning, adding to signs of a slowdown in the euro zone’s second-biggest economy. That was nonetheless a shock to many economists, who on average had forecast a fall to 8.8 percent.\nThe economy picked up after the election of President Emmanuel Macron last year but has since been caught up in a gradual loss of momentum in the euro zone as a whole.\nSeparately, Macron faces a challenge of a different kind as he prepares to head off to Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin: Iran, Syria are among the issues on the table.\nThis is a test for Macron’s strategy of nurturing dialogue with awkward characters: A month ago he left Washington empty-handed after failing to make an impact on Donald Trump, either on trade or Iran; it is far from certain he will be able to wield any influence on Putin, notably regarding Russia’s role in the Syrian conflict.\nBrexit negotiations are continuing in a low-key kind of way in Brussels this week, and a pair of junior ministers will update the UK parliament today on what progress is being made. But behind the scenes the talk is more of the growing anger of hard Brexiteers at what they see as the prospect of a clean exit from the EU being sold down the river.\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the once obscure backbencher who has emerged as the de facto champion of hard Brexit, is now wondering out aloud whether Theresa May and her government really want to leave the EU at all.\nIn a podcast for a Conservative Party website, Rees-Mogg expressed fears that May’s attempts to find a solution to the Irish border dilemma would end up with Britain remaining tethered to Brussels. He added that he and other Brexiteers felt they were being treated like “toads being boiled in water”.\nThis expression of frustration will add to speculation of a brewing putsch against May - the only thing holding the hard Brexiteers back at the moment seems to be the concern that such a coup could go spectacularly wrong and bring Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn to power. French President Emmanuel Macron takes a selfie with La Republique en Marche party members after the presentation of the French government's urban policy at the Elysee Palace in Paris, May 22, 2018\nMARKETS AT 0655 GMT\nWorld stock markets turned gloomy on Wednesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump put a dampener on rising optimism over U.S.-China trade talks overnight by saying he was displeased with their progress and also as he threw doubts about the timing of next month’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nWith one eye on the release later of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting, this was enough to see most of the main Asia bourses lose more than 1 percent, with an added weight to Tokyo stocks as the yen rallied on the Korean doubts. The dollar remained pumped up elsewhere, however, with Turkey’s plummeting lira still in the spotlight. “The lira fall is now on the agenda of world markets and some are saying there is an increased risk of contagion in other emerging markets from the Turkey risk” GCM Securities analyst Enver Erkan\nThe lira, which has now lost more than a fifth of its value so far this year in its worst run in a decade, went into tailspin early Wednesday – losing as much as 3.5 percent at one point to a new record of 4.845 per dollar before stabilising somewhat.\nThere’s been no direct trigger for the mounting losses over the past 48 hours other that puzzlement at the absence of any action or even warning from the country’s central bank after many assumed it was poised to tighten liquidity last week.\nWithout some intervention, there’s little sign of a floor for the lira amid intense political pressure from the country’s President Erdogan on the central bank not to raise interest rates, an election on June 24 and warnings from credit ratings agencies such as S&P Global and Fitch about the damage to the country’s finances from the lira plunge and the threat to central bank independence. Ten-year Turkish government borrowing rates have jumped more than 250 basis points this month alone.\nItaly has been the other focus of the week, but was calmer early on Wednesday as investors awaited the green light from Italy’s President on the formation of the incoming coalition government. Euro/dollar has resumed its probe lower after a brief foray above $1.18 on Tuesday.\nEuropean stocks are expected to follow Asia markets and U.S. futures lower, with eyes on flash PMI business survey readings for May from around the world. Oil prices slip almost half a percent, edging away from $80 a barrel, pressured by the possibility of more OPEC supply ahead of the OPEC meeting next month.\n— A look at the day ahead from European Economics and Politics Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
