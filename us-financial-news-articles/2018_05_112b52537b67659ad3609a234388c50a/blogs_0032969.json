Second, the country has strong data protection legislation. We believe these two qualities make Switzerland the perfect place to move part of our sensitive infrastructure.”\nKaspersky Security Network is the cloud-based system through which Kaspersky collects data from the computers of its business customers, in order to spot and combat threats.\nThe Department of Homeland Security last year banned federal agencies from using Kaspersky software because Russia’s intelligence agencies could force the company to help spy on its customers. “The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security,” the department said at the time.\nWe’re relocating a good part of our critical R&D infrastructure to Switzerland. A quick Q&A with details about Global Transparency Initiative: https://t.co/2WN1Z1p02f pic.twitter.com/6XRdZnSBTP\n— Eugene Kaspersky (@e_kaspersky) May 15, 2018\n“Storing [the Kaspersky Security Network data] in Switzerland under the supervision of an independent organization means that any access to this data is meticulously logged—and the logs can be reviewed at any moment should any concerns arise,” Kaspersky said.\nThe relocation is part of Kaspersky’s “Global Transparency Initiative” and it creates the company’s first “transparency center.” It is common for companies with government contracts to allow the secure inspection of their code, to check for hidden backdoors, and that’s what will also be on offer at Kaspersky’s Zurich facility.\nAs for the third-party organization that will review Kaspersky’s source code and keep an eye on its employees’ access to customers’ metadata, Kaspersky said it “supports the creation of a new, non-profit organization to take on this responsibility, not just for the company, but for other partners and members who wish to join.”\nThe plan is to relocate Kaspersky’s “assembly line” by the end of this year, and the data processing side by the end of 2019. Kaspersky also says it will open transparency centers in North America and Asia by 2020.", "external_links": ["https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/swiss-assembled-security/22378/", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://t.co/2WN1Z1p02f", "https://twitter.com/e_kaspersky/status/996290155324542976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/6XRdZnSBTP", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143"], "published": "2018-05-15T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:50:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
