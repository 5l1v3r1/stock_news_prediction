The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.\nWine said one of the things that attracted Polaris to Boat Holdings was that the company doesn't \"perform quite as cyclical as the boat or RV industry.\"\n\"Boat Holdings expands Polaris' footprint in the recreational outdoors market, commanding more of consumers' discretionary spending,\" Wine said in a statement.\nStrong consumer sentiment , increased traffic in dealerships and tax cuts that benefited consumers are all signs of future growth for the company, Wine told CNBC.\nShares of Polaris Industries declined Wednesday after the announcement, but are up more than 30 percent year to date.\nCorrection: Polaris Industries is based in Medina, Minnesota.
