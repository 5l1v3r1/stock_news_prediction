Other residents also told the news network that they smelled burning brush and heard tree branches snapping.\nFootage from a drone aired on the Hawaii News Now website showed lava incinerating trees as it crept near structures.\nTwo emergency shelters were opened to take in evacuees, the Civil Defense Agency said.\nGovernor David Ige tweeted that he had activated the Hawaii National Guard to provide help in the emergency response.

Lava flows from the volcano, one of five on the island, have covered 48 square miles (125 sq km), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nThe leading edge of the lava can reach temperatures of about 2,100 Fahrenheit (1,150 Celsius).
