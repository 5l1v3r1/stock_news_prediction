The products were later adopted by social-media stars, including Kim Kardashian.\nMany giants of the health and personal care world have been hit hard by declining footfall in traditionally reliable sales channels such as malls and department stores. Anastasia, however, sells its products primarily online.\nFor TPG, the deal would come hard on the heels of another large investment in the same category, after it agreed earlier this month to acquire a minority stake in skin care company Rodan + Fields.\nReporting by Harry Brumpton and Joshua Franklin in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:04:10.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
