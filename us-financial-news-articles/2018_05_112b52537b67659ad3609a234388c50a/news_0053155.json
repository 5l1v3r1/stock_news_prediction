Ross said in a \"Squawk Box\" interview that \"national security is broadly defined,\" adding, \"economic security is military security; and without economic security, you can't have military security.\"\nThe Commerce Department said late Wednesday that it started an investigation into whether more auto imports threaten to \"impair\" national security by \"weakening\" the U.S. economy.\nNational security is defined to include \"the economy, to include the impact on employment, to include a very big variety of things,\" Ross told CNBC.\nThe department claims imported passenger vehicles account for 48 percent of passenger vehicles sold in the U.S., up from 32 percent 20 years ago.\nCramer later Thursday acknowledged the first quarter of 2018 showed an acceleration in the number of cars imported. But the \" Mad Money \" host warned auto tariffs would dramatically impact U.S. relationships with foreign countries. \"We would just have no relations with these countries,\" he said.\n\"I'm not saying you would destroy their economies, but you would make it so they would go into a recession,\" Cramer said.\nToyota 's U.S.-traded shares were lower on the news, while domestic auto stocks were mixed.\nThe Commerce Department, under Ross, recommended imposing heavy tariffs on foreign producers of steel and aluminum in February in the interest of national security.\nRoss told CNBC on Thursday that those steel and aluminum tariffs are having the desired effect, leading to nearly two dozen U.S. factories opening or reopening.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.\nBy signing up for newsletters, you are agreeing to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .", "external_links": ["https://nbcuni.com/privacy/"], "published": "2018-05-24T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:16:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
