Commitments from lenders were due May 24.\nUS stock markets sank more than 1% in value Tuesday on downbeat guidance on trading from JP Morgan and worries over Italy, putting the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for their biggest one-day drops in a month, according to Reuters.\nLeveraged loans, which usually move in line with equities, were trading down Tuesday, in general, between 1/8-1/4 of a point, according to a trader.\n“Names that recently broke in the secondary are trading down if [the deal is] viewed as an aggressive repricing of a not-so-well known name. Higher-rated corporates are trading at or above their OIDs (original issue discounts),” the trader said.\nAmerican Axle said earlier this month it was looking to lower pricing on its US$1.5bn term loan due in April 2024. The company circulated guidance of 200bp over Libor with a 0% Libor floor and an issue price in the 99.875-100 range.\n“There’s a lot of Libor plus 175bp paper that is trading poorly. BB-rated names or lower are trying to go tight and are being bid below their OIDs,” a buyside source said.\nAmerican Axle is rated B1/BB-. The loan is rated Ba2/BB.\n“I think the feeling is that the market should straighten out, but in the near term it’s going to be a little bit harder for repricings,” a second buyside source said.\nAmerican Axle lined up the loan at a size of US$1.55bn in March 2017 to support its acquisition of Metaldyne Performance Group. The loan priced at 225bp over Libor with a 0.75% floor.\n“The market is pulling back. People are going to start saying ‘no’ soon,” the trader said.\nJP Morgan declined to comment.\nReporting by Michelle Sierra; Additional reporting by Jonathan Schwarzberg; Editing by Lynn Adler and Jon Methven\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T00:34:07.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
