(Nasdaq:URGN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments to address unmet needs in the field of urology, with a focus on uro-oncology, today announced financial results for first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an overview of the Company’s recent developments.\n“We are excited about the upcoming late-breaking presentation at AUA of the Interim Analysis of our pivotal Phase 3 OLYMPUS trial of UGN-101 (MitoGel™) for the treatment of LG UTUC. Our team remains intensely focused on our most important milestone - submitting an NDA to the FDA in Q1 2019, with the goal of UGN-101 potentially becoming the first-ever approved treatment for LG UTUC,” said Ron Bentsur, Chief Executive Officer of UroGen. “In addition to UGN-101, we continue to advance our pipeline, as demonstrated by our planned IND submission in mid-2018 for UGN-102 (VesiGel™), as well as other development programs that have the potential to transform existing treatment paradigms across a number of urologic conditions.”\nRecent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nClinical Development Progress of UGN-101 (MitoGel™): The Company will present an interim analysis from the OLYMPUS pivotal trial of UGN-101 in patients with LG UTUC on Monday, May 21, 2018 during the Plenary Session of the 113 th AUA Annual Meeting in San Francisco, CA. Presentation details and the full text for the abstract are available online through the Journal of Urology website . Top-line results from the completed OLYMPUS trial are expected in 2H 2018, with the Company planning to submit an NDA in Q1 2019 to the FDA for UGN-101 for the treatment of LG UTUC. Potential approval and commercial launch of UGN-101 in the United States is targeted for 2H 2019.\nAdvancing the Pipeline and Potential for the RTGel™ Platform: UGN-102 (VesiGel™): The Company intends to submit an IND Application to the FDA for UGN-102 as a potential first-line chemoablation treatment and alternative to the transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) surgical procedure for low-grade non-muscle invasive bladder (LG NMIBC) in mid-2018 and commence a single-arm, open-label Phase 2b trial shortly thereafter. There are currently no drugs approved by the FDA as first-line treatment for non-muscle invasive disease, and only three drugs have been approved by the FDA, all as adjuvant treatments, following TURBT. UGN-201 (Vesimune™): The Company continues to evaluate, in preclinical models, its novel imiquimod formulation for bladder instillation as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of high-grade UTUC. A clinical trial of UGN-201 in this indication is expected to commence in 1H 2019. BotuGel™: Enrollment of patients by Allergan in the Phase 2 trial of RTGel™ in combination with BOTOX® 1 for the treatment of overactive bladder is ongoing. This clinical trial, if successful, has the potential to demonstrate the broad applicability of the RTGel platform beyond uro-oncology.\nCorporate Developments The Company strengthened its financial position with the completion of a public offering of ordinary shares in January 2018, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $64.2 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $127.5 million. This includes net proceeds of approximately $64.2 million from a public offering of ordinary shares in January 2018.

(Nasdaq:URGN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing advanced non-surgical treatments to address unmet needs in the field of urology, with a focus on uro-oncology. The Company has developed RTGel™, a proprietary sustained release, hydrogel-based platform technology that has the potential to improve therapeutic profiles of existing drugs.
