None of the soldiers was injured.\nLater in the evening, sirens warning of rocket fire went off in southern Israel, sending residents running for shelter, though the military then said it was machine gun fire from Gaza that set off the alarms.\nHostilities over the Israel-Gaza frontier have soared since Palestinians began mass-demonstrations on March 30, which Israel deems to be cover for attempts to breach the border fence.\nAt least 116 Palestinians have been killed and thousands hurt by army gunfire in the protests, drawing foreign censure of Israel’s deadly tactics. Israel blames Hamas for provoking the violence, which the group denies.\nReporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T18:46:12.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
