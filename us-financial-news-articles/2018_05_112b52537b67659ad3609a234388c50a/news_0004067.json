They cited police.\nPhone calls to officials at the High Tech Crime Police Department went unanswered.\nPolice are investigating Dung’s death, state media reported.\nDung was the deputy head of the department, whose former head, Nguyen Thanh Hoa, was arrested in March on suspicion of involvement in an illegal online gambling ring.\nAuthorities in April also arrested Lieutenant General Phan Van Vinh, the former chief of the General Department of Police, whom police said was suspected of involvement in the ring.\nThe two former officers have yet to face trial. They have made no public statements.\nOfficials and state media in the communist-ruled country often denounce gambling as a “social evil” but it is widespread. Police shut down dozens of gambling rings annually.\nLast year, Vietnam said it would allow some citizens to gamble at selected casinos, in a move aimed at boosting domestic tourism and raising state revenue.\nVietnamese citizens aged 21 years and over with a regular monthly income of at least 10 million dong ($440) will be allowed to enter casinos for a trial period of three years, according to a government decree.\nThe arrests of the police officials come amid a corruption crackdown in Vietnam that has seen several senior government officials and executives of state-owned enterprises arrested and jailed.
