(\"ABAX\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ABAX) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Zoetis Inc. (\"Zoetis\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement ABAX shareholders will receive $83.00 in cash for each share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether ABAX's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $90.00 per share, or $7.00 above the offer price. Additionally, ABAX recently announced positive financial results. It reported revenue of $67.9 million, representing an increase of 17% when compared to the figures reported in the same period of the previous year.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether ABAX's Board acted in the best interests of ABAX's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own ABAX shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.
