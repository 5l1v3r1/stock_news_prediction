Like all small businesses, they have seen ups and downs over the past year, buffeted by major changes in tax policy and, more recently, great uncertainty around trade policy.\nBut more than small-business owners in any other industry, those in retail trade will have to adapt — if they haven't already — to a world that is more reliant on the internet. Among the most common forms of adaptation is Facebook , according to the second-quarter CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey.\nEven as Facebook continues to deal with the fallout from its privacy scandal, small-business owners in the retail trade are more likely to maintain (49 percent) or increase (15 percent) than pull back on Facebook advertising. That compares to the group of all small-business owners who plan to maintain (35 percent) their level of Facebook spending or who plan to spend more (11 percent).\nTwenty-seven percent of all small-business owners said they plan to pull back on spending, versus 19 percent in the retail trade, the lowest level of pullback among the five sectors for which there are enough respondents to split out sector-level results. Retail businesses are also the most likely to have tried Facebook advertising (57 percent) at some point.\nThese data come from the second-quarter CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey of 2,048 small-business owners conducted online from April 11–17, 2018. 63 percent of retail business owners say Amazon is bad\nFrom its beginnings in the 1990s as a platform for selling books, Amazon was broadly perceived as a threat to exactly these types of small businesses. Independent bookstores, which were already threatened by big chains, like Borders and Barnes & Noble, knew they would end up having to compete with Amazon's wholesale prices and scale. Twenty years later that competition is still playing out.\nNearly a third (32 percent) of small-business owners in the retail trade industry say their business competes with Amazon for customers. That's four times as many who say Amazon helps drive customers to their business (8 percent). In no other industry do small-business owners sense the same degree of competition with Amazon.\nOverall, 81 percent of all small-business owners say that their business is not affected by Amazon. Among those in the retail trade industry, just 51 percent say so.\nThis sense of competition may color these small-business owners' views of Amazon as a whole. Amazon provides opportunities to small businesses — through advertising and by serving as a marketplace for goods — but these seem to be discounted by small-business owners who have to compete with the tech giant for customers.\nMost small-business owners in retail trade (63 percent) say Amazon is, in general, bad for small businesses, and just 14 percent say it is good. Those numbers are stark compared with small-business owners overall, among whom 44 percent say Amazon is bad for small business and 31 percent say it is good. Do you think that Amazon is good for small businesses?
