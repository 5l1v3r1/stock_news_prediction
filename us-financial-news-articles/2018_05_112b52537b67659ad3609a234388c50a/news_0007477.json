Adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $8.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share compared with $17.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings is a non-GAAP measure for which a reconciliation is provided within this release.\nConsolidated net sales totaled $410.6 million and $390.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted the year-over-year comparison by $21.8 million. On a constant currency basis, Composite Fibers’ net sales were essentially flat and Advanced Airlaid Materials’ increased by 7.8%. Specialty Papers’ net sales declined 3.1% in the year-over-year comparison.\n“Our engineered materials businesses continued to deliver solid performance in the first quarter despite a higher raw material inflation environment,” said Dante C. Parrini, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our Advanced Airlaid Materials business grew shipments by 6% over the prior year period driven by hygiene, wipes and home care products. This business also achieved a major strategic milestone this quarter – beginning production and commercial shipments from our new facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas. In Composite Fibers, growth in wallcover and technical specialty products drove a 3% increase in shipments and a 6% improvement in operating profit.”\nMr. Parrini continued, “Profitability for our Specialty Papers business was down, but in-line with our expectations. However, we are encouraged by improving supply-demand conditions from industry capacity reductions that have resulted in an increase in operating rates and improved pricing dynamics. This enabled us to achieve volume growth of 1.3% and an increase in average selling prices of $33 per ton compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect prices to continue moving higher in the coming quarters as operating rates remain high.”\n“Looking ahead, our engineered materials businesses represent significant opportunity for Glatfelter as we remain focused on accelerating growth. We are excited about the prospects for Advanced Airlaid Materials, and we expect the Fort Smith facility to enable this business to deliver projected volume growth of 10% to 12% this year. Demand for our Composite Fibers products remains strong and we believe its performance will continue to strengthen throughout the year. We will continue our unrelenting pursuit of cost efficiencies and process improvements across our business as we work to offset rising input costs. In addition, we anticipate our cash flow profile to improve significantly with the major capital programs now behind us,” Parrini concluded.\nAs announced in February, the Company made the decision to review strategic alternatives for its Specialty Papers business. Its review is ongoing and there can be no assurance that this review will result in a particular outcome.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP measure:\nThree months ended March 31 2018 2017 In thousands, except per share Amount EPS Amount EPS Net income $ 5,716 $ 0.13 $ 11,603 $ 0.26 Adjustments (pre-tax) Costs related to strategic initiatives 2,109 — Airlaid capacity expansion costs 3,033 1,958 Cost optimization actions — 2,013 Specialty Papers' environmental compliance — 2,264 Timberland sales and related costs (1,115 ) — Total adjustments (pre-tax) 4,027 6,235 Income taxes (1) (955 ) (682 ) U.S. Tax Reform (180 ) — Total after-tax adjustments 2,892 0.06 5,553 0.12 Adjusted earnings $ 8,608 $ 0.19 $ 17,156 $ 0.39\n(1) Tax effect on adjustments calculated based on the incremental effective tax rate of the jurisdiction in which each adjustment originated and the related impact of valuation allowances. The sum of individual per share amounts set forth above may not agree to adjusted earnings per share due to rounding.\nA description of each of the adjustments presented above is included later in this release.\nFirst Quarter Business Unit Results\nComposite Fibers\nThree months ended March 31 Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 Change Tons shipped 40,047 38,787 1,260 3.2 % Net sales $ 141,598 $ 125,103 $ 16,495 13.2 % Operating income 15,289 14,438 851 5.9 % Operating margin 10.8 % 11.5 % Composite Fibers’ net sales increased $16.5 million, or 13.2%, primarily due to a 3.2% increase in shipping volumes, a $16.7 million favorable impact from currency translation and $0.3 million from higher selling prices.\nComposite Fibers’ first quarter of 2018 operating income totaled $15.3 million, an increase of $0.9 million compared to the year-ago period. The benefit of higher shipping and production volumes partially offset the $3.5 million unfavorable impact from higher raw material prices. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by $1.3 million.\nAdvanced Airlaid Materials\nThree months ended March 31 Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 Change Tons shipped 26,286 24,826 1,460 5.9 % Net sales $ 69,609 $ 59,838 $ 9,771 16.3 % Operating income 7,217 7,092 125 1.8 % Operating margin 10.4 % 11.9 % Advanced Airlaid Materials’ net sales increased $9.8 million, or 16.3% primarily due to a 5.9% increase in shipping volumes, a $5.1 million favorable impact of currency translation and $0.7 million from higher selling prices.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $7.2 million, or 1.8% higher than the comparable period a year ago. Higher selling prices were more than offset by higher input costs and other general cost inflation totaling $1.2 million. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $0.4 million.\nSpecialty Papers\nThree months ended March 31 Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 Change Tons shipped 188,440 197,223 (8,783 ) (4.5 )% Net sales $ 199,440 $ 205,772 $ (6,332 ) (3.1 )% Energy and related sales, net 1,428 1,129 299 26.5 % Operating income 2,370 13,536 (11,166 ) (82.5 )% Operating margin 1.2 % 6.6 % Specialty Papers’ net sales decreased $6.3 million, or 3.1%, reflecting the permanent shutdown of a machine in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by a more favorable mix of products sold.\nSpecialty Papers’ operating income totaled $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $11.2 million compared with the same period a year ago. Higher raw material and energy prices adversely impacted results by approximately $5.6 million. Higher freight costs and depreciation expense negatively impacted results by $1.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. In addition, transition costs associated with the machine shutdown, severe weather and water quality issues, partially offset by the benefits of workforce reductions efforts, adversely impacted earnings by $3.4 million.\nOther Financial Information\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.8 million on pre-tax income of $8.5 million. On adjusted earnings, the provision for income taxes totaled $3.9 million on adjusted pre-tax earnings of $12.5 million. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 31.2% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 28.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The higher rate in 2018 primarily reflects the impact of the 2017 U.S. tax reform.\nBalance Sheet and Other Information\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $117.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and net debt was $388.5 million compared with $365.2 million at the end of 2017. (Refer to the calculation of this measure provided in the tables at the end of this release.)\nCapital expenditures during 2018 and 2017 are summarized below:\nCapital Expenditures Three months ended\nMarch 31 In thousands 2018 2017 Airlaid capacity expansion $ 11,320 $ 9,550 Specialty Papers' environmental compliance projects - 7,694 Normal capital expenditures 15,248 19,539 Total capital expenditures $ 26,568 $ 36,783 Adjusted free cash flow for the first three months of 2018, was $(7.6) million compared with $(12.0) million in 2017. (Refer to the calculation of these measures provided in this release.)\nOutlook\nComposite Fibers’ shipping volumes in the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be approximately 5% higher than the first quarter with an improved mix. Selling prices are expected to be in-line with the first quarter and raw material and energy prices are expected to increase moderately.\nAdvanced Airlaid Materials’ shipping volumes in the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be approximately 3% higher than 2018 first quarter. For the full-year 2018, we anticipate shipping volumes to be 10% to 12% higher than 2017. Selling prices and raw material and energy prices are expected to increase slightly when compared to the first quarter of this year.\nSpecialty Papers’ shipping volumes in the second quarter are expected to be 5% below the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the annual maintenance outages at both mills. Average selling prices are expected to increase $30/ton and we expect raw material and energy prices to increase slightly; however, energy consumption is expected to be seasonally lower in the second quarter. The adverse impact of operational challenges related to machine transition costs, weather and water quality issues totaling approximately $5 million in the first quarter are not anticipated to impact the second quarter. The Company also plans to complete the annual maintenance outages at its U.S. facilities in the second quarter of 2018, which are expected to adversely impact operating income by approximately $26 million to $28 million compared with $22.9 million in the second quarter of 2017.\nConsolidated capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $67 million and $72 million.\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be approximately 33% in 2018 compared with 19% for 2017.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will hold a conference call at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern) today to discuss its first quarter results.

All other components of net periodic benefit costs are to be presented below the determination of operating income in “Other, net”. As a result of applying the ASU, Costs of products sold for the first quarter of 2017 was increased by $1.3 million and Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $0.2 million and the offsetting net reclassification reduced Non-operating expense by $1.1 million. The adoption of the ASU only required reclassification of amounts of net periodic benefit costs and did not impact the amount of net income reported.\nBusiness Unit Financial Information\n(unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31 Dollars in millions Composite Fibers Advanced Airlaid Materials Specialty Papers Other and Unallocated Total 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net sales $ 141.6 $ 125.1 $ 69.6 $ 59.8 $ 199.4 $ 205.8 $ — $ — $ 410.6 $ 390.7 Energy and related sales, net — — — — 1.4 1.1 — — 1.4 1.1 Total revenue 141.6 125.1 69.6 59.8 200.8 206.9 — — 412.1 391.8 Costs of products sold 114.7 99.6 59.7 50.5 186.5 179.9 2.3 6.2 363.2 336.2 Gross profit (loss) 26.9 25.5 9.9 9.3 14.3 27.0 (2.3 ) (6.2 ) 48.9 55.6 SG&A 11.6 11.1 2.7 2.2 11.9 13.5 10.9 8.1 37.1 34.9 (Gains) losses on dispositions of plant, equipment and timberlands, net — — — — — — (1.6 ) - (1.6 ) - Total operating income (loss) 15.3 14.4 7.2 7.1 2.4 13.5 (11.6 ) (14.3 ) 13.4 20.7 Non operating expense — — — — — — (4.9 ) (3.1 ) (4.9 ) (3.1 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 15.3 $ 14.4 $ 7.2 $ 7.1 $ 2.4 $ 13.5 $ (16.5 ) $ (17.4 ) $ 8.5 $ 17.6 Supplementary Data Net tons sold (thousands) 40.0 38.8 26.3 24.8 188.4 197.2 — — 254.8 260.8 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 7.4 $ 6.8 $ 2.8 $ 2.3 $ 8.1 $ 7.2 $ 1.1 $ 1.0 $ 19.4 $ 17.3 Capital expenditures 5.1 4.7 13.2 10.6 6.5 18.3 1.8 3.2 26.6 36.8 The sum of individual amounts set forth above may not agree to the consolidated financial statements included herein due to rounding.\nSelected Financial Information\n(unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31 In thousands 2018 2017 Cash Flow Data Cash provided (used) by: Operating activities $ 7,659 $ 7,561 Investing activities (24,901 ) (36,783 ) Financing activities 15,842 30,479 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 19,431 17,282 Capital expenditures 26,568 36,783\nMarch 31 December 31 2018 2017 Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents $ 117,277 $ 116,219 Total assets 1,764,612 1,730,795 Total debt 505,738 481,396 Shareholders’ equity 723,992 708,928 Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release includes a measure of earnings before the effects of certain specifically identified items, which is referred to as adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP measure. The Company uses non-GAAP adjusted earnings to supplement the understanding of its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings is meant to present the financial performance of the Company’s core operations, which consist of the production and sale of specialty papers, composite fibers papers and airlaid non-woven materials. Management and the Company’s Board of Directors use non-GAAP adjusted earnings to evaluate the performance of the Company’s fundamental business in relation to prior periods. For purposes of determining adjusted earnings, the following items are excluded:\nCosts related to strategic initiatives. These adjustments primarily reflect one-time professional and legal fees incurred directly related to evaluating certain strategic initiatives. Airlaid capacity expansion costs. These adjustments reflect non-capitalized, one-time costs incurred related to the start-up of a new airlaid production facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas and implementation of a new business system. Cost optimization actions. These adjustments reflect charges incurred in connection with initiatives to optimize the cost structure of certain business units in response to changes in business conditions. The costs are primarily related to headcount reduction efforts, asset write-offs and certain contract termination costs. Specialty Papers environmental compliance. These adjustments reflect non-capitalized, one-time costs incurred by the business unit directly related to the compliance with the U.S. EPA Best Available Retrofit Technology rule and the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule. This adjustment includes costs incurred during the transition period in which the newly installed equipment was brought on-line. Timberland sales and related costs. These adjustments exclude gains from the sales of timberlands as these items are not considered to be part of our core business, ongoing results of operations or cash flows. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact our operating performance. U.S. Tax Reform. These adjustments reflect amounts estimating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The TCJA includes, among many provisions, a tax on the mandatory repatriation of earnings of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and a change in the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21%.\nUnlike net income determined in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP adjusted earnings does not reflect all charges and gains recorded by the Company for the applicable period and, therefore, does not present a complete picture of the Company’s results of operations for the respective period. However, non-GAAP adjusted earnings provide a measure of how the Company’s core operations are performing, which management believes is useful to investors because it allows comparison of such operations from period to period. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCalculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow Three months ended\nMarch 31 In thousands 2018 2017 Cash from operations $ 7,659 $ 7,561 Less: Capital expenditures (26,568 ) (36,783 ) Add back: Airlaid capacity expansion 11,320 9,550 Add back: Specialty Papers' environmental compliance projects — 7,694 Adjusted free cash flow $ (7,589 ) $ (11,978 )\nNet Debt March 31 December 31 In thousands 2018 2017 Current portion of long-term debt $ 11,607 $ 11,298 Long term debt 494,131 470,098 Total 505,738 481,396 Less: Cash (117,277 ) (116,219 ) Net Debt $ 388,461 $ 365,177\nContacts: Investors: Media: John P.
