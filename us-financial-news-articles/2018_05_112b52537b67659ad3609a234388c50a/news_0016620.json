Bernstein\n“We are paying a lot of attention ... within our existing framework. To the extent you have a machine learning tool that is interacting with customers we want to make sure that the traditional protections are being complied with,” Quarles said.\nWhile the Fed may need “more specialised responses” to the use of artificial intelligence or computer algorithms in assessing risk and making credit decisions, he said he was hesitant to impose “bounds” on what institutions can do, rather than develop “milestones” or circuit breakers that would pause any process that was producing bad results.
