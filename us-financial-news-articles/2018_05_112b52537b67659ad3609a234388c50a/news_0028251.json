I drank a lot of salt water,” he said. The pirates had stolen his boat. “I looked to the stars and moon. I just hoped and prayed.”\nAt one point closer to shore, Goberdhan gave up and sank, but fought back to the surface and eventually found passing fishermen who brought him to shore. ‘TWO NIGHTS DRIFTING’\nAnother survivor, 33-year-old Sherwin Lovell, told a similar though more gruesome story from his own boat.\nThe pirates poured the fishermen’s cooking oil into a pot on their victims’ boat and turned the stove on.\n“The men came with the pot and started burning us with the oil,” Lovell said from his apartment in Paramaribo, nursing wounds on his back, arms and left foot.\nThe pirates also cut them and sprayed them with gasoline, as they cowered helplessly in crates used to store fish.\n“I jumped overboard because they said they would kill everybody,” said Lovell. “I spent two nights on the water drifting. Luckily, the tide carried me to shore.”\nWhen finally in hospital, capping his trauma, Lovell found out his partner had herself fallen ill in an unrelated incident - and suddenly died the next day. “I want to know why all this is happening to me.”\nGuyana’s Police Commissioner David Ramnarine said the attack appeared to stem from a previous killing on the mainland.\n“The basis for this gruesome, heinous and dastardly attack has to do with some sort of retaliation by one of the persons in custody whose brother was allegedly gunned down in a drive-by shooting on March 30 in Suriname,” Ramnarine said Wednesday in Georgetown.\nSuriname’s government temporarily suspended fishing off its coast after the attack. Undeterred, Goberdhan said he would be back on the water soon. “I love it out there.” Additional reporting by Ank Kuipers in Paramaribo; Writing by Girish Gupta and Leon Wietfeld; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Alistair Bell", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:11:37.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
