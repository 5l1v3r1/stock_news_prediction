The team’s best efforts have included reaching the round of 16 three times, in 1994, 1998 and the previous World Cup in Brazil in 2014.\nThis year’s squad has acknowledged they are “underdogs”, who need to play not as individuals but together to take on a tough group, including Argentina and their talisman, Lionel Messi.\n“We are not playing Messi but Argentina, it’s all about team work, with or without Messi, and our focus is to perform better in the World Cup,” said forward Ahmed Musa, who also plays in Russia for CSKA Moscow.\n“We have to be looking at the quality of our players - and I believe we are going to Russia to do well - and not the quality of other countries’ players,” he told Reuters.\nNigeria play a friendly game against Democratic Republic of Congo in the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt later on Monday.\nOn 2 June, Nigeria also face off against England in a friendly match at Wembley Stadium.\nReporting by Mike Oboh in Port Harcourt; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T14:59:00.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
