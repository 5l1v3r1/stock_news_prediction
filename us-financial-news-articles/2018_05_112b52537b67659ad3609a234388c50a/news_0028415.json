He was speaking after the conclusion of a meeting of the two foreign ministers at a resort east of Athens.\nPositive work had been done, he said, and the two ministers would be briefing their prime ministers who were expected to meet in Bulgaria on May 17 on the sidelines of an EU-Western Balkans summit.\nThe two countries decided last year to renew their efforts to try to reach a settlement well before the summer.\nThe foreign ministers, Nikos Kotzias of Greece and Nikola Dimitrov of Macedonia, did not take questions. In statements on Friday, Dimitrov said discussions were at a pivotal point.\n“We are in a very delicate phase ... in a way tackling one of the last remaining differences,” Dimitrov said.\nBoth sides see 2018 as a year of opportunity.\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hopes to resolve the matter to gain more political leverage in Europe, and at the same time increase his popularity at home where many Greeks feel the country’s debt crisis and three massive bailouts have compromised its sovereignty.\nMeanwhile, Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who came to power a year ago, wants to accelerate his country’s accession to NATO and the EU to boost international support for his fragile coalition.\nGreece has said a compromise could include a compound name with a geographical or chronological qualifier by which the country would be known and referred to in all international institutions - the so-called “erga omnes”.\nExamples could include Upper Macedonia and North Macedonia.\nPending a settlement, the ex-Yugoslav nation was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).\nReporting by Renee Maltezou and Michele Kambas; Editing by Clelia Oziel and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:26:19.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
