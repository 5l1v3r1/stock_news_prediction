The Vision Fund invested 2.5\nbillion in Flipkart in August last year.\nIt also did not comment on its reasons for cashing out. The Flipkart exit comes far more quickly than SoftBank's average investment duration of 13.5 years.\nThe Vision Fund has invested $30 billion in startups in the last year. Son, who, as of last May, has attracted $93 billion to his technology investment vehicle, said last week he is looking to start a new fund â€” potentially further upending the world of dealmaking.\nMajor investments by the fund include ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, co-working space provider WeWork Cos and chip designer Arm Holdings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T06:13:07.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
