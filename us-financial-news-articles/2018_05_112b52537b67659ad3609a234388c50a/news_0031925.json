The only thing we can hope for is that he has a great final and wins us the trophy.”\nGriezmann has only managed to win one trophy with Atletico, the 2014 Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid, having lost the 2016 Champions League final to Real on penalties after hammering the crossbar from the spot during the 1-1 draw in Milan. ANXIOUS TO WIN\nHe could hardly have wished for a better setting for his next European final than the Groupama stadium in Lyon, an hour’s drive from his home city Macon and where he scored two goals for France in a 2-1 win over Ireland in the last-16 of Euro 2016.\nThe striker also has the ideal opponents in Marseille, having told newspaper L’Equipe this month that he had hoped all season long Atletico would be drawn with his compatriots, who he considers to be a bigger club than Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain.\nTeam mate Saul Niguez, however, believes only one thing will be on Griezmann’s mind in Lyon.\n“He’ll be extra motivated but not because he’s playing near his city but because he’s anxious to win a trophy and to be important,” said the midfielder.\n“In this final he has to prove himself and take a step forward.\n($1 = 0.8362 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:20:09.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
