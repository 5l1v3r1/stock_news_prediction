(OTC PINK: AMFE) is pleased to announce the completion of the ‘Morning” acquisition that was mentioned in a press release from the company dated March 22nd 2018. The acquisition was an all cash deal of approx. $150,000 EUR which was paid in full and going forward, beginning in the Amfil Technologies Inc. 2018 annual report covering the period to June 30th 2018, ‘Morning’ will be consolidated into the company’s financial statements.\n2011 marked the official birth of ‘Morning’ in Toulouse, in the south of France.

Some of the newest titles that will be hitting the market in the future will be IKAN, Red Panda and Kill the Unicorns.\n‘Kill the Unicorns’ is a title the company is especially excited for as the Unicorn theme and trend has been very popular in the past two years. Capitalizing on the strong theme, the game also brings a fun and accessible gameplay to families and casual gamers.\n\"Kill the Unicorns\" was financed on the Kickstarter platform, thanks to almost 8,000 backers and numerous partners (retailers, board game cafés) around the world. The game is highly anticipated: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/morningplayers/kill-the-unicorns\n‘Morning’ will continue to be run by a group of six experienced professionals within the industry from France as Snakes & Lattes Publishing SAS.

The company is in the process of franchising throughout North America. Snakes & Lattes Inc. was the first board game bar and cafe in North America, is believed to be the largest in the world and have the largest circulating public library of board games in North America for customers to choose from. Snakes & Lattes Inc. currently has a 100+ member staff and recently acquired the exclusive distribution rights throughout Canada for some of the most popular board games in the world.

Inc. which recently rebranded its technology under Advanced Ozone Integration as an extension of the existing ozone technology being utilized in the food and beverage industry and integrated by A.C.T.S. into companies such as Pepsi, Nestle, Sysco, Sun Pacific and many others. The system is a triple-function sanitization unit capable of naturally eliminating 99.9% of water and airborne pathogens and the typically problematic pests that wreak havoc for cultivators (like aphids, whiteflies and spider mites), as well as bacteria, fungus, microbes and mold on surfaces, all without chemicals. The unit can also constantly regulate a given facility's water supply, oxygenating the water and maintaining a consistent PPM infusion of ozone that prevents the formation of algae, bacteria or mold (allowing for comprehensive water recycling), simultaneously removing the need to use pesticides and/or dangerous, often carcinogenic products to treat production problems, as is common throughout the industry today. This environmentally-friendly solution also eliminates odors, while slightly reducing the air temperature, lowering energy consumption by the HEPA filtration and HVAC systems and could potentially allow for a facilities process to be labeled certified organic in the U.S.A. when the crop is no longer considered illegal on the federal level, otherwise \"Clean Green\" or \"Certified Kind\" in the meantime. The EcoPr03 GRO3 Antimicrobial System recently passed product review by a registered USDA certifying agent for use in California as well as Pennsylvania and surrounding states. The subsidiary has developed a strategic partnership with Roto Gro, the creator of proprietary rotary hydroponic technology. More information on this product line can be found on the www.gro3systems.com website or on twitter @GRO3Systems.\n3) Interloc-Kings Inc. is a hardscape construction company servicing the Greater Toronto Area.
