As reported in January, the Bank took a negative one-time adjustment to net income at the end of the first quarter due to the tax law changes of December 2017. However, we expect the change will be offset by the lower tax rate and internal strategies that have already partially offset the adjustment. We continue to explore new services, income sources, and options for controlling expenses where appropriate.\nThe Company, which is headquartered in Gouverneur, New York, is the holding company for Gouverneur Savings and Loan Association. Founded in 1892, the Bank is a New York State chartered savings and loan association offering a variety of banking products and services to individuals and businesses in its primary market area in southern St. Lawrence and northern Lewis and Jefferson Counties in New York State.\nStatements in this news release contain as that term is defined in the Private 1995.
