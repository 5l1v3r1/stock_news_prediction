REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa\nI response to international criticism over its use of live fire in the demonstrations, the Israeli army says it is protecting its border and takes such action only when protesters, some hurling firebombs and trying to plant explosives, come too close.\nLate on Saturday, an explosion killed six gunmen belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.\nHamas on Sunday blamed Israel and threatened a response. The Israeli military declined to comment on the blast.\n“We hold the enemy directly responsible for this crime, and for previous crimes, and the Zionist enemy will pay a dear price,” said a statement issued by Hamas’s armed wing after the funeral marches on Sunday.
