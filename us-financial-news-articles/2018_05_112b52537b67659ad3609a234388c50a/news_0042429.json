Annual gains in the transportation sector were also less than last month as gasoline prices were up 14.2 percent, pulling back from March’s 17.1 percent increase.\nHigher costs for clothing and food helped to offset the softness elsewhere.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:19:12.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
