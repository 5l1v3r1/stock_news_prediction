Operating income was $17.9 million, compared to $17.6 million for the same period in 2017. The operating margin was 16.0 percent, compared to 15.7 percent in the first quarter 2017. The first quarter 2018 period includes merger transaction costs of $0.5 million for Capella Education Company. Diluted net income per common share from continuing operations was $1.16, compared to $0.94 for the same period in 2017. Merger transaction costs reduced diluted net income per common share from continuing operations for first quarter 2018 by $0.04.\nOperating and Segment Highlights\nThe “Post-Secondary” segment is comprised of Capella University and Sophia Learning; the “Job-Ready Skills” segment consists of Capella Learning Solutions, Hackbright Academy and DevMountain.\nPost-Secondary Segment\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were $109.2 million, down 0.3 percent compared to $109.5 million in the same period a year ago. Operating income was $19.4 million, compared to operating income of $20.3 million for the same period in 2017. The operating margin was 17.8 percent in the first quarter 2018, compared to 18.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Post-Secondary segment operating results are primarily attributable to Capella University. Capella University new enrollment increased by 1.8 percent compared to first quarter 2017, primarily due to strong performance at the bachelor’s degree level. Total Capella University active enrollment decreased 1.6 percent to 38,181 learners, and early cohort persistence was stable after gains of approximately 22 percent over a period of more than 6 years. FlexPath, Capella University’s fastest-growing offerings, continued to positively impact new and total enrollment in the first quarter 2018, and is now 22 percent of Capella University’s Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees total enrollment.\nJob-Ready Skills Segment\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were $2.8 million compared to $2.3 million in the same period of 2017. Operating loss was $1.0 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to a loss of $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt March 31, 2018, Capella Education Company had cash and marketable securities of $192.7 million, compared to $181.4 million at Dec. 31, 2017, and no debt as of these dates.\nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $21.3 million compared to $17.0 million in the same period a year ago.\nDividend and Share Repurchases\nA quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per outstanding share of common stock was declared on Feb. 21, 2018 and paid on April 13, 2018. In addition, a quarterly cash dividend of the same amount was declared on April 30, 2018 and is payable on June 29, 2018.\nThe Company had $27.0 million of share repurchase authorization remaining at March 31, 2018. No shares were repurchased in the first quarter of 2018.\n2018 Goals and Outlook\nThe Company’s goal for 2018 is to deliver continued revenue growth. To achieve this goal, annual new enrollment growth will be needed in a continuing volatile enrollment environment, as well as stable or improving early cohort persistence and continued revenue growth in the Job-Ready Skills segment. In addition, the Company is managing the Job-Ready Skills segment to be less dilutive in 2018 and expects the annual tax rate to be slightly above 25 percent.\nMerger Update\nAs announced on Oct. 30, 2017, Capella Education Company and Strayer Education, Inc. (“Strayer”) (NASDAQ:STRA) agreed to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction, creating a national leader in education innovation. As previously disclosed, on Nov. 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. In addition, on Jan. 19, 2018, the Company and Strayer announced that shareholders of both companies voted to approve the proposals to effect the merger. The proposed merger remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approvals by State regulators and relevant accreditation bodies. By letter dated Feb. 26, 2018, the Department of Education issued the results of its preacquisition review of the proposed change in ownership of Capella. That letter confirms that, subject to submission of additional documents following the closing, the University will have uninterrupted participation in the Title IV Programs while the Department of Education completes its review of the relevant documentation. Capella Education Company and Strayer continue to expect that the merger will close in the third quarter of 2018. Following the completion of the merger, Strategic Education, Inc. will be the corporate entity under which both Capella University and Strayer University will continue to operate as independent and separately accredited institutions.\nConference Call\nIn light of the pending merger, the Company will not be providing financial guidance or hold an investor conference call.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain information in this news release does not relate to historical financial information, including statements relating to future prospects and expectations regarding our growth, revenues, enrollment, and operating performance, and should be considered within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
