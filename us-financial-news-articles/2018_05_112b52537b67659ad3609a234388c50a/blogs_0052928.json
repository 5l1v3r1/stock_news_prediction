The company said the measure would last for 15 days and give the government time to negotiate an end to the strike.\nThe strike is making fuel scarce. Long lines could be seen at some gas stations, and Rio reduced its bus service by 50 percent Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:15:39.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
