Two of its executives agreed to plead guilty to price-fixing in December 2016, following an investigation by the Justice Department's Anti-Trust Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nStephen Hodge, a former executive at tuna producer StarKist, was also charged in May last year with participation in the conspiracy to fix the price of canned tuna from 2011 to 2013.\nThe canned tuna market in the United States has long been dominated by three companies. Thai Union Group Plc's Chicken of the Sea is the largest, followed by Bumble Bee and StarKist. In December 2015, the Justice Department stopped Thai Union Group from buying Bumble Bee.\nStarKist is a subsidiary of the Dongwon Group of South Korea.\n(Reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:12:45.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
