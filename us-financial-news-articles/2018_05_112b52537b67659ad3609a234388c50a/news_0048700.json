Voting against the budget would represent a gesture without real effects for Catalonia, it said.\n“Far from constituting a blank check to the PP government, this decision allows the PNV to maintain its capacity of political influence in order to contribute to a dialogue and a solution in Catalonia,” the PNV said.\nThe Basque Nationalist Party announced its decision before the vote in parliament, which is expected to take place later on Wednesday.\nThe Spanish government has so far maintained its direct rule of Catalonia. It objects to Catalan leader Quim Torra’s choices to become Catalan councillors, four of whom face charges related to last year’s independence drive.\nThe budget proposal contains pension increases agreed with the Basques. Spain, which has a deficit target for 2018 of 2.2 percent of economic output, expects its economy to grow 2.7 percent this year.\nReporting by Jesús Aguado and Sonya Dowsett; editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:05:21.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
