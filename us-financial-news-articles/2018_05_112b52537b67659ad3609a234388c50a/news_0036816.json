The S&P 500 declined 0.1 percent to 2,720.13 as tech declined 0.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2 percent to 7,382.47 with Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet all falling.\n\"Will that be successful?

The European Union has become very spoiled.

Given the substantial repricing of short term interest rates since September this is hardly surprising,\" Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management, wrote in a note.\nInvestors have been selling Treasurys amid fears that rising inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than the market is expecting.\n\"There's a tug-of-war between the positives — good economic data, strong earnings and tax cuts — and all the negatives, including geopolitics, higher interest rates and trade talks with China,\" said Jeff Carbone, managing partner of Cornerstone Financial Partners.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:30:55.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
