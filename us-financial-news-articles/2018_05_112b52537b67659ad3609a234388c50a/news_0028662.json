Don’t listen to anyone who says we can’t build things in Britain and that a casino economy, which produces little but soaring inequality and insecurity, is our only future.”\nShipbuilders from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea and Spain attended a recent Ministry of Defence industry day to discuss the work, according to documents obtained by the GMB union under the Freedom of Information Act.\nThe government’s decision to allow foreign companies to bid for the work comes soon after controversy over the decision to snub a British manufacturer to produce post-Brexit blue passports.\nThe defence ministry said in a statement that Britain is currently witnessing a “renaissance in national shipbuilding” and that it encourages British shipyards to bid for the support ships contract.\nBritish shipyards once produced half of the world’s new ships but now account for less than half a percent, Corbyn will say.\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:09:03.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
