On one occasion they shot at the car I was driving — 22 bullet holes with an assault rifle.”\n“I wouldn’t wish on anyone the things that I went through, and the truth is that if there is a bigger scoreline one day, then I’m not going to be happy, I am going to feel solidarity with those that it happens to because I know what they are going to go through,” he said.\nGuevara, who went on to play professionally in Spain, the United States and Guatemala, is now a youth coach at a sports centre near the capital San Salvador.\nHis focus now is on helping prevent the 8,000 or so youngsters who fall under his care from joining local gangs.\nHe has not forgotten that fateful day in Alicante but he is nevertheless thankful for the opportunity to play on football’s greatest stage.\n“I am happy now. I am no longer bitter,” he said. “On the contrary, I am thankful that I was able to play for my country.” Writing by Andrew Downie,; Editing by Neville Dalton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T22:05:54.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
