(\"Tree Island\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:TSL) announced today its financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, revenues were $66.5 million versus $63.0 million during the corresponding period in 2017 on account of implementing price increases into the market to counteract the increasing domestic and offshore rod costs. Throughout the quarter, the average selling price increased each month with the implementation of successive price increases that were reinforced by complementary industry wide actions resulting in improved profitability relative to the negative trends experienced throughout much of 2017.\nGross profit for the first quarter amounted to $6.7 million versus $7.5 million during the same period in 2017, while gross profit margin was at 10.1% compared to 11.9% in the same period last year. Gross profit and gross profit margin were lower due to margin compression in the earliest part of the quarter while additional price increases were being implemented. As the quarter progressed, profitability continued to improve as average selling price increases counteracted the continued rise of raw material costs. Volumes were lower in the quarter in the Construction market segments due to adverse weather as well as targeted actions to reduce low profit items to improve product mix in particular in the Residential and Industrial markets. As a result, EBITDA for the quarter amounted to $3.5 million, compared to $4.2 million during the same period in 2017.\n“The first quarter of 2018 demonstrates a return to an improving profitability trend in our business after the challenging industry-wide cycle we faced through much of 2017. The improvement in profitability is largely attributable to our continued focus on pricing discipline as we address sustained inflationary raw material costs,” said Dale R. MacLean, President and CEO.\n“We are encouraged by the positive pricing trends in the market and the improving profitability across Tree Island’s product range,” said Amar S. Doman, Chairman of Tree Island Steel Ltd.\nSummary of Results\n($'000 unless otherwise stated)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue 66,491 63,040 Cost of sales (58,980 ) (54,729 ) Depreciation (819 ) (816 ) Gross profit 6,692 7,495 Selling, general and administrative expenses (4,142 ) (4,221 ) Operating income 2,550 3,274 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 119 97 Gain (loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment (1 ) (47 ) Other expenses (26 ) - Changes in financial liabilities recognized at fair value (91 ) 10 Financing expenses (755 ) (711 ) Income before income taxes 1,796 2,623 Current Income tax (expense) recovery - (241 ) Deferred Income tax (expense) recovery (693 ) (632 ) Net income (loss) 1,103 1,750 Operating Income 2,550 3,274 Add back depreciation 819 816 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 119 97 EBITDA 1 3,488 4,187 Net income per share 0.04 0.06 Dividends per share 0.02 0.02 Sales volume (tons) 2 46,009 51,337 Gross profit per ton ($/ton) 145 146 EBITDA per ton ($/ton) 76 82\nFinancial Position as at: March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Total Assets 140,431 133,681 Total non-current financial liabilities 18,524 18,356\nAbout Tree Island Steel\nTree Island Steel, headquartered in Richmond, British Columbia, since 1964, through its four operating facilities in Canada and the United States, produces wire products for a diverse range of industrial, residential construction, commercial construction and agricultural applications.
