The ability of CMHA-S to adhere longer to the ocular surface, resist degradation and protect the ocular surface makes it well-suited for treating various ocular surface injuries.\nEGP-437, EyeGate’s other product in clinical trials, incorporates a reformulated, topically active corticosteroid, Dexamethasone Phosphate, that is delivered into the ocular tissues through EyeGate’s proprietary innovative drug delivery system, the EyeGate II Delivery System.
