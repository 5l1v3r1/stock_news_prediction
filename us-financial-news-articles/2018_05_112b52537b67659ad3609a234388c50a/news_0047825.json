U.S. crude futures were up 30 cents at $71.55.\n“Oil prices are finely balanced in today’s trading session. Ramping up of oil production in the U.S. and concerns surrounding high oil prices impacting demand are weighing,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics.\n“Nevertheless, signs of receding trade tensions between the U.S. and China, together with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Venezuela’s deteriorating economic scenario, are limiting losses.”\nA possible U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the world’s two largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday, giving global markets a lift in early Monday trade.\nThe energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last week voiced concern about recent oil market volatility and plan to meet Russian counterpart Alexander Novak in St Petersburg to continue consultations.\n“It’s worth watching St Petersburg at the end of this week.
