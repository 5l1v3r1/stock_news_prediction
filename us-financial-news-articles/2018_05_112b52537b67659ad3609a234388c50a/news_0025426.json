In 1957 it saw Britain’s worst ever nuclear accident when a fire led to a radioactive leak.\nAnother radioactive leak in 2005 prompted a fine of 500,000 pounds ($678,000) for its operator.\nThe plant is currently going through a massive decommissioning program, which includes dismantling infrastructure and decontaminating nuclear waste.\nThe cost of the work has been estimated at more than 70 billion pounds and is expected to take another 100 years to complete.($1 = 0.7374 pounds) Reporting by Susanna Twidale; editing by Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:49:44.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
