It will invest tens of millions of euros in the expansion. Eurowings generated online revenues of over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in 2017 and is aiming for 1.5 billion this year. $1 = 0.8379 euros Reporting by Victoria Bryan Editing by Maria Sheahan", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:20:14.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
