Analysts on average expected 61 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company said it now expected 2018 adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, up from its prior view of $3.50 and above current Wall Street estimates of $3.53 per share.\nReporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T19:47:27.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
