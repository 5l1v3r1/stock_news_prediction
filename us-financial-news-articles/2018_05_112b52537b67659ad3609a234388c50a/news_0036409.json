This is then encrypted with the sender’s private ‘key’ and decrypted by the receiver using a separate public key.\nTo exploit the weakness, a hacker would need to have access to an email server or the mailbox of a recipient. In addition the mails would need to be in HTML format and have active links to external content to be vulnerable, the BSI said.\nIt advised users to disable the use of active content, such as HTML code and the loading of external content, and to secure their email servers against external access.
