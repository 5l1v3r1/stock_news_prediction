While 60 percent of respondents say they like Queen Elizabeth, her son Charles is far less popular.\nNearly half of respondents would prefer “someone else” to succeed the Queen, while only 37 percent want Charles, who is the father of Harry and his older brother William.\n“This YouGov poll shows a very clear picture of a nation disinterested and apathetic about the royal family,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said.\n“We’re not a nation of republicans yet - but we’ve stopped being a nation of royalists.” Britain's Prince Harry poses with Meghan Markle in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace, London, Britain, November 27, 2017.
