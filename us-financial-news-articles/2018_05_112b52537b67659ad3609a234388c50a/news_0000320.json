REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier Revenue per available room (RevPAR), a key industry measure, rose 3.5 percent in the three months to March 31, above Morgan Stanley’s estimate of 2.5 percent. This compares with a 2.7 percent growth reported a year earlier.\nStrong corporate demand and higher occupancies owing to the Chinese New Year lifted RevPAR growth in its Greater China region to 11 percent in the quarter, with 10 percent growth in mainland China.\nIn the United States, the largest market for the company in terms of room numbers, RevPAR was up 2.2 percent, which compared with a rise of 1.9 percent a year ago.\nThe group is expanding its luxury offering and focusing on business customers to help it weather rising competition from online rental marketplaces.\nIHG signed an agreement on Thursday to rebrand and operate a portfolio of 13 upmarket hotels in Britain.\nThe hotelier, which runs over 5,000 hotels under brands such as Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and InterContinental, said the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many major currencies increased group RevPAR to 6.5 percent in the quarter.\nContinental Europe RevPAR was up 6 percent in the first quarter, helped by “continued recovery in terror impacted markets”, the company said.\nReporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T11:03:06.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
