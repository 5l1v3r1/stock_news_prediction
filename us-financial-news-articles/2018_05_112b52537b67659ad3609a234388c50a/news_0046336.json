The funds are expected to be distributed later this week.\nDHS is assisting 48 states with election security. It handed out a chart at the briefing to members that said states need to have auditable systems, spend time on planning, training and drills and they should “consider investing in full system architecture reviews.”\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said after the briefing that members are concerned that “not only Russia but possibly other foreign adversaries are now going to start looking at how they can meddle in the midterm elections and we need to be prepared. We were caught off guard last time.”\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian leadership at a very high level was involved in the attempt to interfere in the U.S. election in order to boost President Donald Trump’s candidacy.\nRussia has denied interfering in U.S. elections.\nSeveral Democrats after the briefing expressed concern that the federal government was not doing enough to safeguard elections.\n“It is clear that our government must do more and whatever possible to secure our elections from foreign interference. The integrity of our democracy is at stake,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee.\nU.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen speaks to reporters after she, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats briefed members of the U.S. House of Representatives on election security at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis UNPRECEDENTED, COORDINATED A May 8 U.S. Senate report said that in 2016 “cyber actors affiliated with the Russian Government conducted an unprecedented, coordinated cyber campaign against state election infrastructure.” Russian actors “scanned databases for vulnerabilities, attempted intrusions, and in a small number of cases successfully penetrated a voter registration database.”\nThe report said in a small number of states, “these cyber actors were in a position to, at a minimum, alter or delete voter registration data.”\nKrebs said on Tuesday that DHS wanted states to “increase awareness” and have a “layered defense.”\nIf a voter’s information was missing, for example, they could request a provisional ballot. “If we do detect something, we can overcome it,” he said.\nDuring the 2016 campaign, hackers stole emails from the personal account of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman and from the Democratic National Committee, and they were used to embarrass Clinton.\nRepresentative C.A. “Dutch” Ruppersberger, said members of Congress need to be aware of cyber risks. “We need to focus on it, make it a priority,” he said.\nDHS said in March it is prioritizing election cyber security above all other critical infrastructure it protects.\nThe agency has said that 21 states had experienced initial probing of their systems from Russian hackers in 2016 and that a small number of networks were compromised, but that there remains no evidence any votes were actually altered.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told reporters the federal government should quickly alert states if they learn of election system hacking.\nHe also wants a “real-time communications channel” between the intelligence community and technology companies in order to assure that internet firms are notified if evidence emerges that Russia is creating fake Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) pages or taking other actions to influence the elections.\nReporting by David Shepardson; additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; editing by Bill Berkrot\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:46:22.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
