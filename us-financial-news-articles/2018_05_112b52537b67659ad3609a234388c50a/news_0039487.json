Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini address a joint news conference after their meeting at the EU Council in Brussels, Belgium May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\nFederica Mogherini made the comments at a news conference in Brussels after hosting the EU’s first “joint council” with Cuba since the bloc dropped all sanctions on the island and agreed on a political framework within which to strengthen ties.\nThe EU has said it is now Cuba’s top trade and investment partner, and arguably plays a bigger role than traditional allies like Venezuela or Russia as the island implements market reforms to its centrally-planned economy.\nAnalysts say the EU has also taken advantage of U.S. indifference or a diplomatic vacuum, as the Trump administration backtracks on a fragile detente with Cuba.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n“I personally believe that Cuba could play a positive role in trying to avoid further negative developments (in Venezuela) and trying to re-open and negotiate a political solution and dialogue,” Mogherini told joint news conference with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez.\nVenezuela will hold a presidential election on May 20 that the opposition coalition is boycotting, saying it is a farce intended to legitimize a “dictatorship” led by President Nicolas Maduro.

First Mogherini visited, then a delegation from the European Investment Bank.\nThe bloc signed on Tuesday an agreement with Cuba to invest 18 million euros to help its achieve its ambitious goals in terms of developing renewable energy on the island.\nThe EU has said it will sign cooperation agreements worth 49 million euros in total.
