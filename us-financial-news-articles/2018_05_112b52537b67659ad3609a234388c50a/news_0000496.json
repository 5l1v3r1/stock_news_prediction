(“Hudbay” or the “company”) (TSX:HBM)(NYSE:HBM) today released its first quarter 2018 financial results. All amounts are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nSummary:\nNet profit of $41.4 million and earnings per share of $0.16 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $10.0 million (restated) and loss per share of $0.04 (restated) in the first quarter of 2017 Operating cash flow 1 of $131.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 64% increase from the first quarter of 2017 Production of copper, gold and silver in concentrate increased by approximately 13%, 50% and 32%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 as a result of higher milled throughput at all operations Reduced net debt 2 position by $37.7 million and improved liquidity during the first quarter 2018; as at March 31, 2018, Hudbay had net debt of $585.4 million and total available liquidity of $810 million, including $392.8 million in cash Consolidated cash cost 2 , net of by-product credits, of $0.98 per pound of copper, an 11% increase from the first quarter of 2017 Consolidated all-in sustaining cash cost 2 , net of by-product credits, of $1.45 per pound of copper in the first quarter of 2018, down slightly from $1.46 in the first quarter of 2017 Peru precious metals production expected to be 15,000 ounces lower than initial guidance as a result of anticipated delay in mining of Pampacancha, with the majority of the estimated $45 million of Peru growth capital expected to be deferred to 2019; expected to meet all other production and cost guidance for 2018 Test mining of Lalor gold Zone 25 has confirmed the possibility of utilizing selective methods for the gold zone to mine fewer tonnes at a higher grade than reported in the current mineral resource estimate; trade-off studies to assess the mining and processing options for the gold mineral resources at Lalor are ongoing\nNet profit and earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were $41.4 million and $0.16, respectively, compared to a net loss and loss per share of $10.0 million (restated) and $0.04 (restated), respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, operating cash flow before changes in non‑cash working capital increased to $131.8 million, compared to $80.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, mainly as a result of higher copper sales volumes and higher realized prices of all metals.\n“We began the first few months of the year much like we ended last year, by continuing to grow our positive free cash flow and reduce debt,” said Alan Hair, president and chief executive officer. “In 2018, we will look to further increase operating cash flow and reduce net debt. We are also focused on completing the ramp-up of base metal ore production at Lalor and beginning production from the gold zones, both of which progressed well during the first quarter of 2018, as well as moving Rosemont through the permitting process.”\nNet profit and earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were affected by, among other things, the following items:\nPre-tax gain\n(loss) After-tax gain\n(loss) Per share\ngain (loss) ($ millions) ($ millions) ($/share) Changes in accounting standards (3.4 ) (3.8 ) (0.01 ) Foreign exchange gain 4.0 3.4 0.01 Mark-to-market adjustments of various items 10.2 8.5 0.03 Pampacancha delivery obligation (7.2 ) (7.2 ) (0.03 ) Non-cash deferred tax adjustments - (2.8 ) (0.01 ) Effective January 1, 2018, a new revenue accounting standard issued by the International Accounting Standards Board was implemented and applied retrospectively. Under the new standard, Hudbay’s stream agreements with Wheaton Precious Metals now incorporate a significant financing component. The accretion of financing expense on the deferred revenue balance increases the deferred revenue balance over time and the resulting higher deferred revenue balance is amortized to revenue, resulting in higher revenue per ounce of metal sold under the stream, and higher finance expense. The impact to the first quarter of 2018 is an increase to gross margin of $12.8 million, offset by an increase in finance expenses of $16.2 million. The net impact to after-tax earnings per share is a loss of $0.01. All of these changes are non-cash.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Hudbay recognized an obligation to deliver additional precious metal credits to Wheaton Precious Metals as a result of the company’s expectation that mining at the Pampacancha deposit will not begin until 2019.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2017, production of copper, gold and silver in concentrate in the first quarter of 2018 increased as a result of higher milled throughput at all of Hudbay’s operations together with higher grades for precious metals in Manitoba. Zinc production decreased by 6% as Lalor zinc grades have declined in line with the mine plan.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, consolidated cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, was $0.98, an increase compared to $0.88 in the same period last year. The increase is mainly due to increased operating costs at Hudbay’s 777 and Reed mines in Manitoba as the mines approach the later stages of their lives and reduced capitalized stripping at Constancia, resulting in higher operating expense. Incorporating sustaining capital, capitalized exploration, royalties and corporate selling and administrative expenses, consolidated all-in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.45, down slightly from $1.46 in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $36.3 million during the first quarter of 2018 to $392.8 million at March 31, 2018. This increase was mainly a result of cash generated from operating activities of $131.4 million. This inflow was partly offset by $48.7 million of financing expenditures primarily driven by $37.4 million in interest paid on outstanding debt, and $46.0 million of investing activities primarily at Hudbay’s Peru and Manitoba operations.\nNet debt declined by $37.7 million from December 31, 2017 to $585.4 million at March 31, 2018, as a result of cash flow from Hudbay’s operations. At March 31, 2018, total liquidity, including cash and available credit facilities, was $810.0 million, up from $777.9 million at December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Condition ($000s) Mar. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017\n(Restated) Cash and cash equivalents 392,796 356,499 Total long-term debt 978,190 979,575 Net debt 1 585,394 623,076 Working capital 335,800 251,388 Total assets 4,690,748 4,728,016 Equity 2,145,321 2,112,345 1 Net debt is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized definition under IFRS.

For further information, please see page 6 of this news release. Peru Operations Review\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Peru operations produced 31,551 tonnes of copper, which was approximately 16% higher than production in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of improved ore throughput, offset by lower grades in line with the mine plan. Copper equivalent production in the first quarter of 2018 was higher than in the same period in 2017 as there were higher gold grades and higher mill throughput, partially offset by lower copper grades.\nRecoveries of copper, gold and silver were slightly higher in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. Improved recoveries were due to continued plant optimization and processing less transitional ore types.\nCombined mine, mill and G&A unit operating costs in the first quarter of 2018 were 3% lower than the same period in 2017. The lower combined unit costs are mostly related to higher mill throughput partially offset by higher mining costs due to a decrease in the mining costs that are capitalized.\nCash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.32, an increase of 2% from the same period in 2017 mainly as a result of lower capitalized mining costs and higher freight and treatment and refining costs, partially offset by higher copper production and by-product credits.\nSustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.47, a decrease of 9% from the same period in 2017 as a result of the factors noted above as well as reduced sustaining capital expenditures in heavy civil works.\nHudbay completed a twin hole drill program in the fourth quarter of 2017 that confirmed the extent of the positive grade bias that has existed since the commencement of production at Constancia. The company also constructed a new resource model that formed the basis for a new mine plan and technical report for Constancia. The 2018 Technical Report includes an updated mine plan showing an increase to the total metal contained in the estimated mineral reserves. The new mine plan also reflects updated throughput, recoveries and capital and operating cost assumptions for the remaining life of mine at Constancia.\nThe 2018 Technical Report assumes that mining of the high-grade Pampacancha satellite deposit will commence in 2019, which is one year later than contemplated by the previous technical report. Although negotiations to secure surface rights over the Pampacancha deposit continue to progress and Hudbay has been granted access to the land to carry out early-works activities, the company anticipates a one year delay to mining at Pampacancha. In the interim, the company will continue to mine higher-grade ore from the main Constancia pit.\nManitoba Operations Review\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Manitoba operations produced 28,782 tonnes of zinc, 7,655 tonnes of copper and 30,407 ounces of gold-equivalent precious metals. Production of gold and silver was higher than the same quarter in 2017 by 53% and 67%, respectively, as a result of higher precious metal grades at both Lalor and 777. Zinc production was 6% lower compared to the same period of 2017 as a result of lower grades at Lalor in line with the mine plan. Copper production remained consistent compared to the same period in 2017. Production of all metals in Manitoba for full year 2018 is forecast to be within the guidance ranges.\nOre mined at Hudbay’s Manitoba operations during the first quarter of 2018 increased by 2% compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of higher production at the Lalor and Reed mines, partially offset by lower production at the 777 mine. Unit operating costs for all mines for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 23% compared to the same period in 2017. The increase is a function of higher mobile and fixed infrastructure maintenance costs and higher expensed development costs.\nOre mined at Lalor increased as the ramp-up of production continued and the mine transitioned to higher gold and copper grades with lower zinc as outlined in the life of mine plan. Higher unit costs reflect increased cement rock filling, extensive cable bolting as well as continued operating and capital development that are required to increase Lalor’s production rate to 4,500 tonnes per day, which is on track to be completed by the third quarter of 2018. The commissioning of the paste backfill plant, which is on track for mid-2018, is expected to improve scoop availability and provide flexibility to the mine planning and sequencing.\nThe Reed mine maintained consistent production and benefited from higher copper grades as Hudbay mines out Zone 10 at depth. Hudbay is no longer capitalizing development costs at Reed with the pending closure of the mine in the third quarter of 2018, resulting in higher unit operating costs compared to prior periods.\nOre mined at 777 declined as ground conditions warranted rehabilitation of headings and a more conservative stope sequence in order to adapt to more challenging operating conditions as the mine ages. Higher 777 unit operating costs were driven by higher mobile and fixed infrastructure maintenance costs and ground rehabilitation work completed in the quarter, together with the impact of lower production.\nOre processed in Flin Flon in the first quarter of 2018 was 5% higher than the same period in 2017 as a result of increased ore availability due to the transfer of excess Lalor ore to the Flin Flon concentrator. Copper and precious metals recoveries were higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter in 2017 as a result of higher head grades. Unit operating costs at the Flin Flon concentrator were 9% higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of increased material handling costs driven by the management of large stockpiles, and initial difficulties in processing Lalor ore through the Flin Flon concentrator crushing plant due to the impact of cold winter weather. Ore processed at the Stall concentrator in the first quarter of 2018 was 5% higher compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of improved mechanical reliability. Unit operating costs at the Stall concentrator were 24% lower in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 as damage to the crusher in December 2016 had necessitated the use of higher-cost temporary crushing facilities during the first quarter of 2017.\nManitoba combined mine, mill and G&A unit operating costs in the first quarter of 2018 were 16% higher than in the same period in 2017 as a result of higher costs at Hudbay’s mines and the Flin Flon concentrator. Combined unit costs are expected to be within the guidance range for 2018, as the higher costs in the first quarter were caused in part by the colder than normal winter.\nCash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, in the first quarter of 2018 was negative $0.38. This was higher compared to the same period in 2017, primarily as a result of the factors affecting unit operating costs described above. Sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.03, compared to $0.28 in the prior year period as a result of the same factors described above and planned increased sustaining and exploration capital spending.\nLalor Gold Zone Update\nThe Lalor mine plan for 2018 includes some mining of the gold zone for processing at Flin Flon, which was included in Hudbay’s precious metals guidance issued in January. Trade-off studies have been ongoing in order to assess the mining and processing options for the gold mineral resources at Lalor. Test mining of Zone 25 began in February 2018 in order to better understand the characteristics of the gold zone and to inform the evaluation of options for its processing. The test mining has confirmed the possibility of utilizing selective methods to mine fewer tonnes at a higher grade than reported in the current mineral resource estimate. Year to date, Hudbay has mined 4,500 tonnes at 14.5 g/t, confirming the opportunity to operate successfully at a higher cut-off grade. A batch sample of gold-rich ore sent to the Flin Flon concentrator in late 2017 achieved gold recoveries of 65%. Currently, the gold ore is being shipped to Flin Flon for processing.\nIn parallel, Hudbay is continuing exploration in an attempt to further extend gold- and copper-rich veins down plunge from the existing resources and targeting possible extensions of the base metals lenses both up and down plunge from known resources. Highlights from the drill program that focused on extensions of gold- and copper-rich veins, each of which is outside of the current reserve, are provided in the below table.\nHole ID From\n(m) To\n(m) Intercept\n(m) Depth\n(m) Estimated true\nwidth(m) 1 Cu\n(%) 2 Au\n(g/t) 2 189W01 1197.0 1205.0 8.0 1154 7.1 0.1 9.3 193W01 1041.2 1046.5 5.4 1028 4.1 1.1 2.8 267W01 1120.8 1127.2 6.3 1098 4.5 2.7 11.3 273 1211.8 1215.8 4 1202 2.9 1.9 1.2 283 1242.7 1249.0 6.3 1240 4.2 7.8 5.9 283W02 1270.8 1276.3 5.5 1263 4.1 7.8 2.5 296 1227.5 1233.0 5.5 1184 4.2 5.2 5.6 296W01 1220.5 1228.3 7.8 1175 6.1 3.7 5.4 1 True widths are estimated based on drill angle and interpreted geometry of mineralization.\n2 All gold and copper values are uncut.\nIn 2018, Hudbay will continue to conduct test mining of the gold lenses, which will support continued trade-off studies to assess the mining and processing options for Lalor gold and advance the permitting process for the potential refurbishment of the New Britannia mill. Ongoing exploration is targeted at converting gold mineral resources to mineral reserves at Lalor and greenfield gold exploration efforts in Snow Lake.\nRosemont Developments\nWork continues with the U.S. Forest Service on the draft Mine Plan of Operations, which is progressing as planned. The remaining key federal permit outstanding is the Section 404 Water Permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nOpponents of the Rosemont project have filed lawsuits against the U.S. Forest Service challenging, among other things, the issuance of the Final Record of Decision in respect of Rosemont. Hudbay is confident that Rosemont’s permits will continue to be upheld.\nOutlook\nGiven our expectation that mining at Pampacancha will not begin until 2019, we expect that Peru precious metals production will be 50,000 to 70,000 ounces in 2018, a decrease of 20% compared to our initial 2018 guidance issued on January 17, 2018 and consistent with the 25% sensitivity noted in our initial guidance. 3 The majority of the estimated $45 million of Peru growth capital, which includes expenditures for developing the Pampacancha deposit and acquiring surface rights from the local community, is expected to be deferred to 2019. Based on results to date, we expect to meet all other production and cost guidance for 2018.\nNon-IFRS Financial Performance Measures\nNet debt is shown in this news release because it is a performance measure used by the company to assess its financial position. Cash cost, sustaining and all-in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced are shown because the company believes they help investors and management assess the performance of its operations, including the margin generated by the operations and the company. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. For further details on these measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable IFRS measures, please refer to page 27 of Hudbay’s management’s discussion and analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov .\nWebsite Links\nHudbay:\nwww.hudbay.com\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis:\nhttp://www.hudbayminerals.com/files/doc_financials/2018/Q1/MDA181.pdf\nFinancial Statements:\nhttp://www.hudbayminerals.com/files/doc_financials/2018/Q1/FS181.pdf\nConference Call and Webcast\nDate: Thursday, May 3, 2018 Time: 10 a.m. ET Webcast: www.hudbay.com Dial in: 416-849-1847 or 1-866-530-1554 Qualified Person\nThe technical and scientific information in this news release related to the Constancia mine and Rosemont project has been approved by Cashel Meagher, P.
