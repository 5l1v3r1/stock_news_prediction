So far, most investment has been made in the financial and services sectors, plus IT and software businesses.\nOverall, 1,910 companies moved to Germany from abroad last year, bringing 29,000 jobs with them.\nThe biggest investor was the United States, spending on 276 projects and overtaking China with 218. In addition, 1,925 foreign investments were registered because of takeovers, mergers or stake acquisitions.\nA record number of Britons were granted German citizenship last year, the Statistics Office said on Wednesday, citing the potential of Brexit to limit freedom of movement.
