Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki celebrates winning her Spain's Georgina Garcia Perez REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\nWith the first three matches scheduled on Court Philippe Chatrier on day four of the claycout major all going the distance - and lasting a combined eight hours 46 minutes - Wozniacki did not even make it into the arena till shortly before 7pm local time.\nFifty one minutes later the Danish second seed was offering Spain’s Garcia Perez a consolation handshake after she secured a round three meeting with French wildcard Pauline Parmentier.\nWithin those 51 minutes, Wozniacki won five of seven break points earned, belted seven winners, produced only eight unforced errors and won 53 of 78 points contested.\nNo wonder she was all smiles after extending her winning streak at the majors to nine matches.\n“It was definitely a good match. I neutralised her serve, which was the main thing,” said the 27-year-old, whose best showing in Paris is two quarter-final appearances from 10 previous visits.

It felt good out there.”\nA year ago, Wozniacki routed Canadian qualifier Francoise Abanda 6-0 6-0 in the second round. But that was the only straight-sets win she enjoyed at the tournament where she was beaten in the quarter-finals by eventual champion Jelena Ostapenko.\nThis year, she is not only hoping to go much deeper in the tournament, but also wants to enjoy an easier ride at Roland Garros.\n“There is no real easy matches ever, and especially on clay. So I’m just out there trying to keep my rhythm and trying to play my best tennis,” she added.\n“I wish all my matches were like this and I could win with this scoreline.” Reporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:25:34.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
