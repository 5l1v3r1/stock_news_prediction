(NYSE: FLT), a leading global provider of commercial payment solutions, today reported financial results for its first quarter of 2018.\n“Our first quarter revenues and profits finished above our expectations, and our sales, retention, and same store customer trends were very strong. Revenue growth of 17%, excluding the new revenue standard ASC 606 change, and adjusted net income per diluted share growth of 28%, demonstrate the sustainability of our businesses. We delivered organic revenue growth rates of more than 20 percent in the Lodging, Corporate Payments and Tolls business lines, as we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our non-fuel businesses,” said Ron Clarke, chairman and chief executive officer, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. “We continue to advance our Company’s growth as we win new clients, open up new geographies, and provide improved value over a broader range of spend categories.”\nFinancial Results for First Quarter of 2018:\nGAAP Results\nTotal revenues, including the impact of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606, increased 12.5% to $585.5 million in 2018, compared to $520.4 million in 2017. Net income increased 41.4% to $174.9 million in 2018, compared to $123.7 million in 2017. Net income per diluted share increased 43.4% to $1.88 in 2018, compared to $1.31 per diluted share in 2017.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (\"ASC 606\") and related cost capitalization guidance, using the modified retrospective method by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. As such, the Company is not required to restate comparative financial information prior to the adoption of ASC 606 and, therefore, such information for the three months ended March 31, 2017 continues to be reported under FASB ASC Topic 605, \"Revenue Recognition\" (\"ASC 605\"). The adoption of ASC 606 did not materially impact the Company’s financial position. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the adoption of ASC 606 reduced revenue by $24.2 million and increased operating income by $2.7 million. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on net income or net income per common or diluted shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018. As required, a comparison of the current presentation under ASC 606 to the prior presentation under ASC 605 is provided below:\n2018 Reported\nunder ASC 606\n2018 Impact of\nASC 606\n2018 Excluding\nImpact of Adoption\nof ASC 606\n(millions) Revenue $585.5 $24.2 $609.7 Operating Expense $325.4 $27.0 $352.4 Operating Income $260.1 ($2.7) $257.4\nThe above table presents the U.S. GAAP financial measures of Revenue, Operating Expense and Operating Income as reported, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on these measures for the period presented. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on net income and net income per diluted share was not material.\nNon-GAAP Results 1\nRevenues under ASC 605 increased 17.2% to $609.7 million in 2018, compared to $520.4 million in 2017. Adjusted net income 1 increased 26.2% to $233.5 million in 2018, compared to $185.0 million in 2017. Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 increased 28.0% to $2.50 in 2018, compared to $1.96 per diluted share in 2017.\nFiscal-Year 2018 Outlook:\n“The first quarter of 2018 was another strong quarter for the Company. The macro-economic environment was quite favorable versus prior year, and in line with our 2018 expectations,” said Eric Dey, chief financial officer, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. “We are raising our guidance to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. Although foreign exchange rates are trending a little worse than the first quarter average, fuel prices are a bit better than our expectation earlier this year, so we are maintaining our prior macro guidance.”\nFor full year 2018, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. updated financial guidance is as follows:\nRevenues including the adoption of ASC 606, between $2,390 million and $2,450 million; Net income between $705 million and $735 million; Net income per diluted share between $7.55 and $7.85; Revenues under ASC 605 between $2,500 million and $2,560 million; Adjusted net income 1 between $950 million and $980 million; and Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 between $10.20 and $10.50.\nFLEETCOR’s guidance assumptions for 2018 are as follows:\nWeighted fuel prices equal to $2.69 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel for the balance of the year. Market spreads equal to the 2017 average. Foreign exchange rates equal to the seven-day average as of April 2, 2018. Interest expense of $125 million. Fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 93.6 million shares. A tax rate of 22 to 24%. No impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. Excludes any impact related to unauthorized access to Company systems, as described below.\nFiscal Second Quarter of 2018 Outlook:\nFor the second quarter, the Company is expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately the same as the first quarter. The second quarter assumes improving revenue and operating performance versus fset by increased spending on initiatives to be funded from savings on the new Tax Act. Additionally, volumes should build throughout the year, and new asset initiatives are also expected to gain momentum throughout the year resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters.\n1 Reconciliations of GAAP results to non-GAAP results are provided in Exhibit 1 attached. Additional supplemental data is provided in Exhibits 2-3 and 5, and segment information is provided in Exhibit 4. A reconciliation of GAAP guidance to non-GAAP guidance is provided in Exhibit 6. A reconciliation of the impact of adoption of ASC 606 is provided in exhibit 7. Subsequent Event:\nFLEETCOR Reports Unauthorized Access into a Portion of the Company’s Systems\nOn April 26, 2018, Company personnel identified suspicious activity primarily on systems involving the Company’s Stored Value Solutions gift card business. The Company took immediate action to stop the activity and limit the improper use of accessed private label gift card information (these gift cards do not contain personally identifiable information such as consumer names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and other sensitive personal data). The Company through counsel promptly engaged external experts in information technology forensics to assist in the investigation. The Company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected.\nThe investigation is in its early stages but indicates that a significant number of six months or older gift card and PIN numbers were accessed. The affected data does not include personally identifiable information (such as consumer names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and other sensitive personal data). Following discovery, the Company froze certain gift card information and is working with merchant customers to limit the impact of the unauthorized access. The Company did not see any evidence of access to its systems involving fleet cards and other payment products, or to the proprietary and third-party payment networks used to deliver the Company’s payment solutions. The Company continues to investigate its other systems to determine whether any other information or systems have been accessed and whether other customers may have been impacted. This investigation is ongoing and will continue until the full nature and scope of the systems and information accessed has been determined. The Company will provide an update on the incident in its upcoming 10-Q, which it expects to file by May 10, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results today at 5:00pm ET. Hosting the call will be Ron Clarke, chief executive officer, Eric Dey, chief financial officer and Jim Eglseder, investor relations. The conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing (855) 327-6837, or for international callers (631) 891-4304.

Prior to the conference call, the Company will post supplemental financial information that will be discussed during the call and live webcast.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about FLEETCOR's beliefs, expectations and future performance, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"project,\" \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could\" or \"should,\" the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward-looking statements in this press release include statements relating to macro- economic conditions, expected organic growth rates, impact of the new Tax Act, and estimated impact of these conditions on our operations and financial results, the impact of new asset initiatives, revenue and earnings guidance and assumptions underlying financial guidance, and statements regarding the unauthorized access to the Company’s systems, including the assumptions with respect to the investigation of the incident to date. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, such as fuel price and spread volatility; the impact of foreign exchange rates on operations, revenue and income; the effects of general economic conditions on fueling patterns and the commercial activity of fleets; changes in credit risk of customers and associated losses; the actions of regulators relating to payment cards or resulting from investigations; failure to maintain or renew key business relationships; failure to maintain competitive offerings; failure to maintain or renew sources of financing; failure to complete, or delays in completing, anticipated new customer arrangements or acquisitions and the failure to successfully integrate or otherwise achieve anticipated benefits from such customer arrangements or acquired businesses; failure to successfully expand business internationally, risks related to litigation: the final results of the unauthorized access investigation, including the final scope of the intrusion, the type of systems and information accessed and the number of accounts impacted: as well as the other identified under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in FLEETCOR's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. FLEETCOR believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and FLEETCOR does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to update any such statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of such statements to reflect future events or developments except as specifically stated in this press release or to the extent required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net income is calculated as net income, adjusted to eliminate (a) non-cash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards, (b) amortization of deferred financing costs, discounts and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables, and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment, (c) a non-recurring net gain at our equity method investment, (d) impairment of our equity method investment, (e) net gain on disposition of business, (f) loss on early extinguishment of debt and, (g) other non-recurring items, including the impact of the Tax Reform Act and restructuring costs. We calculate adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted net income is a supplemental measure of operating performance that does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations, as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance. We also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired; therefore, we have excluded amortization expense from our adjusted net income. We also believe one-time non-recurring gains, losses, and impairment charges do not necessarily reflect how our investments and business are performing. Reconciliations of GAAP results to non-GAAP results are provided in the attached exhibit 1. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP product revenue organic growth calculation is provided in the attached exhibit 5. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP guidance is provided in the attached exhibit 6. Furthermore, a reconciliation of the impact of the Company’s adoption of the new revenue standard, ASC 606, is provided in exhibit 7, along with its impact on 2018 guidance in exhibit 6.\nManagement uses adjusted net income:\nas measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis; for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; and to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies.\nWe believe, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are key measures used by the Company and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry. By providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with reconciliations, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing strategic initiatives.\nAbout FLEETCOR\nFLEETCOR Technologies (NYSE: FLT) is a leading global provider of commercial payment solutions.
