(NYSE: AVP), a globally recognized leader in direct selling of beauty and related products, today announced its results for the 2018.\nJan Zijderveld, Avon CEO, said, \"Avon's first-quarter results were unsatisfactory and do not represent the underlying potential of the business. During my first 90 days, I have been deeply engaged in a comprehensive review of the Company's operations, including on-the-ground visits to many of our top markets where I have met with many of our direct selling Representatives.\"\nZijderveld emphasized, \"While we are focused on the formulation of Avon's longer-term plans, we are already implementing near-term fixes that support the success and satisfaction of our Representatives--starting with actions to improve service delivery. Our long-term mission is clear, to return Avon to a competitive market position, and we are moving with deliberate urgency to design our turnaround plan.\"\nHighlights for First Quarter of 2018:\nTotal Revenue increased 5% to $1.4 billion, or 2% in constant dollars 1 , both including a 6% reporting benefit due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") Active Representatives and Ending Representatives declined 4% and 1%, respectively, largely due to declines in Brazil Operating Margin increased 100 bps to 3.2% and Adjusted 1 Operating Margin increased 100 bps to 4.0%, both including a benefit of 120 bps due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard Diluted Loss Per Share From Continuing Operations of $0.06 and Adjusted Diluted Loss Per Share From Continuing Operations of $0.02, both including a $0.03 benefit due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard\nDuring the first quarter, the Company adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which had a significant impact on the presentation of sales incentives and Representative fees and associated costs, primarily for brochures. The Company adopted the standard as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of January 1, 2018, therefore, comparative information for prior periods has not been restated. Where appropriate, the impact from adopting the new standard has been separately quantified in this release.\nNew Revenue Recognition Standard (Accounting Standards Codification Topic (\"ASC\" 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers)\nAs further discussed in Avon's Form 10-Q for the 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, as of January 1, 2018. The impact of the cumulative-effect adjustment to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets is primarily driven by sales incentives and Representative fees and associated costs, primarily for brochures.\nHistorically, the cost of sales incentives was presented as other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses and other and recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") over the period that the sales incentive was earned. Under the new standard, the portion of sales incentives or prospective discounts that are associated with a distinct performance obligation are initially deferred on the balance sheet and recognized in net sales and cost of sales when the performance obligation is satisfied.\nHistorically, brochure costs were initially deferred to prepaid expenses and other and charged to SG&A over the campaign length. Under the new standard, the revenue associated with brochures is recognized in other revenue when delivered to the Representative and the related cost is recognized in cost of sales, except in the case of costs for free brochures which are recognized in SG&A. In addition, other fees paid by Representatives to the Company for items such as late payments and payment processing are now reported as revenue, rather than as a reduction of SG&A. The other changes resulting from the new revenue recognition standard were not material.\nThe impact of the change in accounting for revenue recognition on first-quarter 2018 performance is summarized on pages 13-14 of this release.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Income Statement Review (compared with first-quarter 2017)\nTotal revenue for Avon Products, Inc. increased 5% to $1.4 billion, or 2% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 6% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard.\nActive Representatives declined 4% primarily due to decreases in South Latin America and North Latin America.\nAverage order in constant dollars increased 6%, including a benefit of approximately 6% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Growth in South Latin America was offset by a declines in the other segments, primarily Europe, Middle East & Africa.\nEnding Representatives declined 1% primarily due to declines in South Latin America and North Latin America that were partially offset by growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa.\nGross margin and Adjusted gross margin each decreased 280 basis points to 58.4%, including a decline of approximately 310 basis points due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. The change in gross margin was primarily due to the favorable net impact of price/mix partially offset by higher supply chain costs.\nOperating margin was 3.2% in the quarter, up 100 basis points, while Adjusted operating margin was 4.0%, up 100 basis points, both including a benefit of approximately 120 basis points due to the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard. The operating margin and Adjusted operating margin year-over-year comparisons were both unfavorably impacted by higher Representative, sales leader and field expense, partially offset by lower bad debt expense, primarily in Brazil.\nThe provision for income taxes was $32 million, compared with $30 million for first-quarter 2017. On an Adjusted basis, the provision for income taxes was $24 million, compared with $31 million for first-quarter 2017.\nNet loss was $21 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, including a benefit of $0.03 per diluted share due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, compared with a loss of $37 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for first-quarter 2017. Adjusted net loss was $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, including a benefit of $0.03 per diluted share due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, compared with a loss of $28 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for first-quarter 2017.\nAdjustments to First-Quarter 2018 GAAP Results to Arrive at Adjusted Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the following adjustments were made to GAAP results to arrive at Adjusted results and, in total, reduced Diluted loss per share by approximately $0.04:\nThe Company recorded costs to implement (\"CTI\") restructuring within operating profit of approximately $11 million before tax (approximately $9 million after tax), primarily related to the Transformation Plan.\nThe Company recorded one-time tax reserves of approximately $9 million associated with its uncertain tax positions.\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018\nSEGMENT RESULTS\n($ in millions)\nAverage\nRevenue\nActive\nOrder\nUnits\nPrice/\nEnding\nUS$\nC$\nRepresentatives\nC$\nSold\nMix C$\nRepresentatives\nRevenue & Drivers\n% var.\nvs 1Q17\n% var.\nvs 1Q17\n% var.\nvs 1Q17\n% var.\nvs 1Q17\n% var.\nvs 1Q17\n% var.\nvs 1Q17\n% var.\nvs 1Q17\nEurope, Middle East &\nAfrica\n$\n568.4\n12\n%\n2\n%\n(1)\n%\n3\n%\n1\n%\n1\n%\n3\n%\nSouth Latin America\n497.1\nâ€”\n4\n(6)\n10\n(5)\n9\n(3)\nNorth Latin America\n195.6\n1\n(3)\n(6)\n3\n(10)\n7\n(5)\nAsia Pacific\n111.4\n(2)\n(3)\n(1)\n(2)\n(5)\n2\n(2)\nTotal from reportable\nsegments\n1,372.5\n5\n2\n(4)\n6\n(3)\n5\n(1)\nOther operating\nsegments and\nbusiness activities\n21.0\n6\n4\n(5)\n9\n41\n(37)\n(5)\nTotal Avon\n$\n1,393.5\n5\n%\n2\n%\n(4)\n%\n6\n%\n(3)\n%\n5\n%\n(1)\n%\nOperating Profit/Margin\n2018 Operating\nProfit US$\n2018 Operating\nMargin US$\nChange in\nUS$ vs\n1Q17\nChange in\nC$ vs\n1Q17\nSegment profit/margin\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\n$\n74.4\n13.1\n%\n(140) bps\n(170) bps\nSouth Latin America\n27.2\n5.5\n280\n290\nNorth Latin America\n20.8\n10.6\n(50)\n(60)\nAsia Pacific\n10.4\n9.3\n(240)\n(170)\nTotal from reportable segments\n132.8\n9.7\n40\n10\nOther operating segments and business\nactivities\n2.2\nUnallocated global expenses\n(79.2)\nCTI restructuring initiatives\n(10.9)\nTotal Avon\n$\n44.9\n3.2\n%\n100 bps\n60 bps\nOther operating segments and business activities include revenue from the sale of products to New Avon LLC since the separation of the Company's North America business into New Avon LLC on March 1, 2016 and ongoing royalties from the licensing of the Company's name and products. Other operating segments and business activities also include the business results for Australia and New Zealand, which the Company announced it would exit in 2018.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Segment Review (compared with first-quarter 2017)\nWith regards to the discussion below on segment revenue, the difference between the reported and constant-dollar revenue growth is the estimated impact of foreign currency translation.\nTotal Reportable Segment revenue increased 5% to $1.4 billion, or 2% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 6% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were impacted by declines in Active Representatives, primarily in Brazil and Mexico. The Company experienced continued variability with challenges in key markets, particularly Brazil.\nEurope, Middle East & Africa revenue was up 12%, or 2% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 5% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives and lower average order. Russia revenue was up 9%, or 4% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 8% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by lower average order and a decrease in Active Representatives. U.K. revenue was up 1%, or down 9% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 5% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives.\nSouth Latin America revenue was relatively unchanged, or up 4% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 9% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were primarily impacted by a decline in Brazil, partially offset by growth in Argentina, driven by inflationary pricing. Brazil revenue was down 4%, or 1% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 11% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives, as well as lower average order.\nNorth Latin America revenue was up 1%, or down 3% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 5% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives and, to a lesser extent, by lower average order. Mexico revenue was up 6%, or down 1% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 5% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives.\nAsia Pacific revenue was down 2%, or 3% in constant dollars, both including a decline of 1% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives, most significantly in Malaysia, as well as lower average order. Philippines revenue was down 5%, or 2% in constant dollars, both including a benefit of approximately 1% due to the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. Revenue and constant-dollar revenue were negatively impacted by lower average order, partially offset by an increase in Active Representatives.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Cash Flow Review (compared with first-quarter 2017)\nNet cash used by operating activities of continuing operations was $96 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $80 million in the same period in 2017. The approximate $16 million increase to net cash used by continuing operating activities was primarily due to an increase in working capital, most significantly from higher inventory levels. Net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations was $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $22 million in the same period in 2017. The approximate $5 increase to net cash used by continuing investing activities was primarily due to higher capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was less than $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with net cash used by financing activities of continuing operations of $5 million in the same period in 2017. The approximate $6 million benefit to net cash provided (used) by continuing financing activities was primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock relating to employee stock compensation.\nConference call\nAvon will conduct a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time today to discuss its quarterly results.

Comparative information for prior periods has not been restated. Therefore, this supplemental schedule provides balances without the adoption of ASC 606 to enhance comparability to the prior year.\nThe cumulative-effect adjustment was comprised of the following:\na reduction to retained earnings of $52.7 before taxes ($41.1 after tax), with a corresponding impact to deferred income taxes of $11.6; a reduction to prepaid expenses and other of $54.9; an increase to inventories of $39.3; and an increase to other accrued liabilities of $37.1 due to the net impact of the establishment of a contract liability of $91.8 for deferred revenue where our performance obligations are not yet satisfied, which is partially offset by a reduction in the sales incentive accrual of $54.7. The impact of the change in accounting standard on first-quarter 2018 performance is:\nImpact of change in revenue recognition standard\nLine items impacted within the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations\nPer consolidated\nfinancial statements\nAdjustments\nBalances excluding the\nimpact of adopting\nASC 606\nRevenue\nNet sales\n$\n1,309.6\n$\n(25.4)\n(1)\n$\n1,284.2\nOther revenue\n83.9\n(54.9)\n(2)\n29.0\nTotal revenue\n1,393.5\n(80.3)\n1,313.2\nCosts and expenses\nCost of sales\n579.7\n(73.0)\n(3)\n506.7\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n768.9\n11.8\n(4)\n780.7\nOperating profit\n44.9\n(19.1)\n25.8\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n10.4\n(19.1)\n(8.7)\nIncome taxes\n(31.5)\n3.8\n(27.7)\nNet loss\n(21.1)\n(15.3)\n(36.4)\nNet loss attributable to Avon\n(20.3)\n(15.3)\n(35.6)\n(1) Primarily relates to net impact of the timing of recognition of sales incentives.\n(2) Relates to Representative fees (primarily brochure fees, late payment fees and certain other fees), which were reclassified from SG&A.

The Company also refers to these adjusted financial measures as constant dollar items, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes these measures provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, the Company calculates current-year results and prior-year results at constant exchange rates, which are updated on an annual basis as part of the Company's budgeting process. Foreign currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant-dollar growth rates.\nThe Company also presents cost of sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, operating profit, operating margin, income (loss) before taxes, income taxes, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share and effective tax rate on a Non-GAAP basis. The Company refers to these Non-GAAP financial measures as \"Adjusted.\" The Company has provided quantitative reconciliations of the Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. See \"Supplemental Schedule - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within this release for these quantitative reconciliations.\nIn addition, the Company defines free cash flow as net cash used by operating activities of continuing operations less capital expenditures.\nThe Company uses Non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance. These Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes investors find the Non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period. The Company believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of the impacts of: 1) CTI restructuring initiatives; and 2) one-time tax reserves associated with the Company's uncertain tax positions (\"Special tax items\").\nThe Special tax items include the impact on the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2018 due to one-time tax reserves of approximately $9 million associated with the Company's uncertain tax positions.\nView original content: releases/avon-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300641697.html\nSOURCE Avon Products, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avon-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300641697.html", "http://www.avoninvestor.com/", "http://www.avoncompany.com/"], "published": "2018-05-03T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T14:46:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
