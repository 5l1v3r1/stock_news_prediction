Instead of relying on China hawk Peter Navarro, one of his top trade advisors, the president let more moderate Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin take the lead on trade negotiations.\nThe talks haven't yielded any results so far, and Trump said he was dissatisfied with last week's high-level trade negotiations with Chinese officials including Vice Premier Liu He.

Yet earlier this week, before he canceled the meeting, Trump suggested that Kim soured on the idea of a potential summit after the North Korean leader had a second secret meeting with Xi.\n\"There was a somewhat different attitude after that meeting,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"I can't say that I'm happy about it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T15:49:23.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
