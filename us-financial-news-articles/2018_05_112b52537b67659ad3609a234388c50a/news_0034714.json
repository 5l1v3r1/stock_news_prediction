(“TPGE”) (NYSE: TPGE, TPGE.U, TPGE.WS), an energy-focused special purpose acquisition entity led by former Occidental Petroleum Corporation CEO Steve Chazen, today announced certain financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2018 for the Karnes County and Giddings Field assets (the “Magnolia Assets”) that TPGE is under definitive agreements to acquire from affiliates of EnerVest, Ltd. (“EnerVest”).\nMagnolia Assets First Quarter 2018 Highlights (1) :\nOperating revenue of $193.3 million Pro forma EBITDA (2) of $152.2 million Free cash flow (3) of $66.3 million Average daily net production of 45.7 Mboe/d (62% oil, 78% liquids)\nTPGE Chairman and CEO, Steve Chazen, commented: “These strong results were above our expectations for production and realized prices in the first quarter of 2018 and confirm that the Magnolia Assets are an excellent match with our desire to build a large scale company that can generate steady production growth, strong pre-tax margins and significant free cash flow. We are pleased with the outcome of the production and capital program and look forward to future quarters.”\nIn the proposed transaction, TPGE expects to acquire the Magnolia Assets, which represent substantially all of EnerVest’s South Texas division, to create Magnolia Oil & Gas Corporation (“Magnolia”). EnerVest will receive a combination of cash and shares of Magnolia’s common stock in the transaction and will retain a significant ownership stake in Magnolia at closing, which is expected to occur once TPGE’s proxy statement with respect to the transaction has been delivered to TPGE’s shareholders, TPGE’s shareholders have approved the transaction and all other closing conditions have been met. Following closing, Magnolia’s Class A common stock and warrants are expected to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbols “MGY” and “MGY.WS,” respectively. The transaction is structured as an asset purchase with an effective date of January 1, 2018. A more complete description of the proposed transaction can be found in TPGE’s preliminary proxy statement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 10, 2018. Copies of the definitive proxy statement, when available, can be obtained free of charge through the methods described below.\nThe unaudited results of the Magnolia Assets for the first quarter of 2018 were as follows (1) :\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Karnes County\nAssets\nGiddings\nAssets\nMagnolia Assets\nTotal\nNet production: Oil (MBbls) 2,279 263 2,542 Natural gas (MMcf) 2,929 2,497 5,426 NGL (MBbls) 429 238 668 Total oil equivalent (Mboe) 3,197 917 4,114 Average daily net production volume: Oil (Bbls/d) 25,326 2,917 28,243 Natural gas (Mcf/d) 32,543 27,744 60,287 NGL (Bbls/d) 4,770 2,649 7,419 Total oil equivalent (Boe/d) 35,520 10,191 45,710 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 (in thousands,\nexcept for average\nsales prices)\nOperating revenue: Oil sales $ 161,899 Natural gas sales 15,272 NGL sales 16,085 Total operating revenue $ 193,256 Average sales prices: Oil (per Bbl) $ 63.69 Average NYMEX price for oil (per Bbl) $ 62.90 Differential to NYMEX oil $ 0.79 Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 2.81 Average NYMEX price for natural gas (per Mcf) $ 2.80 Differential to NYMEX gas $ 0.01 NGL (per Bbl) $ 24.09 Selected financial statistics: Total operating revenue $ 193,256 Operating expenses (4) 30,434 SG&A (5) 10,625 Pro forma EBITDA (2) $ 152,197 Capital expenditures 85,894 Free cash flow (3) $ 66,302 On March 20, 2018, the date that TPGE announced its proposed acquisition of the Magnolia Assets, TPGE publicly released a set of investor materials. Those investor materials included base case financial projections made available to TPGE’s board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the proposed acquisition and included an oil price sensitivity to the base case financial projections. The base case financial projections assumed $58.00 / Bbl oil index price and $56.67 / Bbl oil price realizations for 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, the Magnolia Assets experienced $62.90 / Bbl oil index price and $63.96 / Bbl oil price realization. The table below summarizes the base case financial projections and oil price sensitivity cases for calendar year 2018, each of which has been previously disclosed, and provides a comparison to the unaudited results of the Magnolia Assets for the first quarter of 2018:\nProjections for the Twelve Months Ending Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 Base Case (6) Sensitivity Cases (7) Actual (1) Index oil price ($ / Bbl) $ 58.00 $ 45.00 $ 65.00 $ 62.90 Realized oil price ($ / Bbl) $ 56.67 $ 43.67 $ 63.67 $ 63.69 Total production (MMboe) 16.6 16.6 16.6 4.1 Total revenue ($MM) $ 687 $ 542 $ 765 $ 193 Pro forma EBITDA ($MM) (2) $ 513 $ 379 $ 581 $ 152 EBITDA Margin (2) 75 % 70 % 76 % 79 % (1) The information presented is based on the unaudited lease operating statements for the Magnolia Assets and will not reconcile to the financial statements of the Magnolia Assets presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

All statements, other than statements of present or historical fact included in this press release, including those regarding TPGE’s ability to consummate the business combination and Magnolia’s strategy, future operations, financial position, projected costs, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in this press release, the words “could,” “should,” “will,” “may,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” the negative of such terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, TPGE disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release. TPGE cautions you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of TPGE, incident to the development, production, gathering and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, TPGE cautions you that the forward-looking in this press release are subject to the following factors: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could delay the business combination or give rise to the termination of the agreements related thereto; (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against TPGE following announcement of the transactions; (iii) the inability to complete the business combination due to the failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of TPGE, or other conditions to closing in the transaction agreement; (iv) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts TPGE’s current plans and operations as a result of the announcement of the transactions; (v) Magnolia’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of Magnolia to grow and manage growth profitably following the business combination; (vi) costs related to the business combination; (vii) changes in applicable laws or regulations; and (viii) the possibility that Magnolia may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this press release, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results and plans could different materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other factors that may impact the operations and projections discussed herein can be found in TPGE’s periodic filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and, when available, the definitive proxy statement. TPGE’s SEC filings are available publicly on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nUse of Projections\nThis press release contains previously disclosed projections for TPGE, including with respect to its revenue and pro forma EBITDA, as well as its production volumes. TPGE’s independent auditors did not audit, review, compile or perform any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in the previously disclosed presentation, and accordingly, did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Those projections were for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results.\nIn this press release, certain of the above-mentioned projected information has been repeated (in each case, with an indication that the information is subject to the qualifications presented herein), for purposes of providing comparisons with historical data. Each of the assumptions and estimates underlying the projected information throughout the press release are based on the data on Slides 18, 24-25 of the investor presentation furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to TPGE’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 20, 2018. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the projected information. Even if the assumptions and estimates are correct, projections are inherently uncertain due to a number of factors outside of TPGE’s control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results are indicative of the future performance of TPGE after completion of the transaction or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the projected information. Inclusions of the projected information in this press release should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the projected information will be achieved.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including pro forma EBITDA, EBITDA margin and free cash flow of the Magnolia Assets. TPGE believes these measures are useful because they allow TPGE to more effectively evaluate the operating performance of the Magnolia Assets and compare the results of the operations from period to period and against its peers without regard to financing methods or capital structure. TPGE does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to similar financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The computations of these measures are not comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP or as indicators of operating performance.\nNo Offer or Solicitation\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities pursuant to the proposed business combination or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act.\nImportant Information for Investors and Shareholders\nIn connection with the proposed business combination, TPGE has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. The definitive proxy statement, when available, and other relevant documents will be sent or given to the shareholders of TPGE and will contain important information about the proposed business combination and related matters. TPGE shareholders and other interested persons are advised to read, when available, the definitive proxy statement in connection with TPGE’s solicitation of proxies for the meeting of shareholders to be held to approve the business combination because the proxy statement will contain important information about the proposed business combination.
