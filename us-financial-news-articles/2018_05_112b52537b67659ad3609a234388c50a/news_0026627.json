Total revenue grew by 9%, or 13% on a non-GAAP basis after excluding $0.3 million in revenue from our exited specialty machining operation from the first quarter of 2017. The number of machines that we recognized in revenue in the quarter increased to six from five in the prior year, backlog expanded by nearly $5 million from December 2017 and machines that have been shipped to customers and are yet to be recognized in revenue totalled eight at the end of the quarter. Given this level of backlog, together with our robust pipeline, scheduled shipments and our available inventory, we expect our first half revenue to be in line with our full year guidance of growth in excess of 20%. Revenue growth at this rate is market leading performance and differentiates ExOne both in our growth potential as well as the increasing industrial acceptance of our binder jetting technology,” stated Jim McCarley, ExOne’s Chief Executive Officer.\nHe continued, “Operationally, we are on plan to meet our aggressive technical improvement goals, and we are driving continuous improvement in our team composition, cost structure, and business processes. We realized year-over-year gross margin improvement this quarter and expect this to continue throughout 2018. Likewise, we are spending R&D dollars on key machine capability improvements with our lead project, the development of a large format fine powder printer, and expect to begin printing trials this quarter.”\nFirst Quarter Revenue – Non-Machine Revenue Drives Growth\nQuarter Ended March 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 % Change Revenue by Product Line\n3D Printing Machines $ 4.5 38 % $ 4.3 39 % 6 % 3D Printed and Other Products, Materials and Services 7.4 62 % 6.6 61 % 12 % Total Revenue $ 11.9 100 % $ 10.9 100 % 9 % Consolidated revenue for the 2018 first quarter grew 9% over the prior-year first quarter. Excluding $0.3 million of revenue attributable to a product line that the Company has exited, the comparable revenue grew 13% on a non-GAAP basis.\nMachine revenue was up 6% to $4.5 million. Six machines were sold in the 2018 first quarter as compared with five in the 2017 first quarter.\nNon-machine revenue (3D printed and other products, materials and services) was up 12% to $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the prior year. This increase was principally driven by higher revenue in the Company’s direct production service center operations and, to a lesser extent, increased consumable material and service revenue based on a growing installed base. These increases were offset with the absence of revenue from the 2017 exit of a specialty machining operation and lower revenue on indirect service centers due principally to machine sales to previous service center customers. Excluding $0.3 million of revenue attributable to the exited specialty machining product line, the comparable non-machine revenue grew by 17% on a non-GAAP basis.\nGiven the long sales cycle and significance of a machine’s average selling price relative to total revenue, fluctuations in machine-sale revenue vary from quarter to quarter. ExOne does not believe that such quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are necessarily indicative of larger trends.\nFirst Quarter Operations – Improving Gross Margin, Accelerated Investments\n($ in millions, except per-share amounts)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nChange\n% Change Gross profit $2.6 $1.6 $1.0 63% Gross margin 22.0% 14.7% Operating loss ($6.4) ($6.7) $0.3 4% Net loss ($6.4) ($6.8) $0.4 6% Diluted EPS ($0.40) ($0.42) $0.02 5% Gross profit of $2.6 million benefited from revenue growth and, when compared with the prior-year first quarter, a reduction of certain costs including restructuring, asset impairment and inventory reserve charges. The current period was negatively impacted by $0.2 million of exit costs and asset impairments associated with the Company’s previously discussed consolidation of its former production service center in Italy into its German adoption center, with the consolidation completed in February 2018.\nR&D expense of $2.8 million for the quarter was up $0.8 million compared with the 2017 first quarter. The increase is in alignment with the Company’s strategy to accelerate new product development activities during 2018.\nSG&A expense was $6.2 million compared with $6.3 million in the 2017 first quarter. The decrease was due to the absence of intangible asset impairment and bad debt charges incurred in the prior-year quarter, partially offset by higher personnel and consulting and professional costs.\nThe 2018 first quarter net loss was $6.4 million, or $0.40 per share, compared with a $6.8 million net loss, or $0.42 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. The improved net loss was principally due to higher gross profit on higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in research and development spending to support the Company’s growth strategy.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP measure, was a $4.5 million loss in the 2018 first quarter, compared with a $3.8 million loss in last year’s first quarter. ExOne management believes that, when used in conjunction with other measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), Adjusted EBITDA assists in the understanding of its financial results. See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of net loss (most directly comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nCapitalization – Cash Invested in Inventory Production to Support Growth\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018 were $16.9 million, compared with $22.2 million at December 31, 2017. Cash used for operating activities in the 2018 first quarter was $4.8 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The use of cash included an increase of $3.5 million in inventories to support the Company’s higher backlog and anticipated growth in 2018. Cash capital expenditures were $0.5 million and $0.2 million in the 2018 and 2017 first quarters, respectively. In 2018, the Company expects cash capital expenditures of $1 to $1.5 million.\nOutlook – Reaffirming 2018 Revenue Growth and Additional R&D Expectations\nMr. McCarley concluded, “Our outlook for the remainder of 2018 and beyond remains positive. It is driven by the expanding level of adoption we are seeing in both binder jetting printing activity and ExOne’s binder jetting printing technology. There is a strong pull emerging in the market place for binder jetting technology and this gives us confidence that accelerating our investments and improving our responsiveness to our customers’ demands, creates a clear path for ExOne to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in 2019.”\nWebcast and Conference Call\nExOne will host a conference call and live webcast on Thursday, May 10 at 4:45 p.m. Eastern Time.

Use of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is intended as a supplemental measure of ExOne’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to its investors to enhance their understanding of ExOne’s financial results. Although Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs, the Company understands that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare ExOne’s performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EBITDA. ExOne’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006176/en/\nThe ExOne Company\nBrian Smith, 724-765-1350\nChief Financial Officer\nbrian.smith@exone.com\nor\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
