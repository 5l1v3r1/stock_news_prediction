The court deemed the strike illegal, saying the action had political aims rather than labor-related goals.\nThe end of the strike that had demanded changes at state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, commonly known as Petrobras, will come as a relief for the company, whose shares have tumbled around 30 percent in the past two weeks over fears that political interference would unwind recent investor-focused policies.\nWhile the effects on output were not immediately clear, the strike did not cause any losses for Petrobras as the company had contingency plans in place, said Brazil’s minister of institutional security, Sergio Etchegoyen, at a news conference.\nMeanwhile, the truckers protest, which has strangled much of Brazil’s economy for 11 days, petered out. Etchegoyen said all roadblocks had been removed, though isolated groups of truckers were causing problems.\nHighway traffic had returned to normal throughout Brazil, federal police said in a statement. Santos, Latin America’s largest port, was now functioning, Admiral Ademir Sobrinho said in broadcast comments.\nGasoline supplies, which had become short in recent weeks as transport routes were blocked, returned to normal at 70 percent of locations, Aurelio Amaral, a director of Brazil’s ANP oil regulator, told Reuters.\nRelated Coverage Brazil police say highway traffic has returned to normal Still, the effects of the protests will linger.\nAt gas stations in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, lines remained long. Produce at supermarkets cost more than usual in some locations, even as supplies were returning to normal.\nCompanies in the machinery industry were crafting plans with workers for collective vacations, while others were planning layoffs, the head of the industry’s trade group, Jose Velloso, told Reuters late on Wednesday, as an inability to obtain supplies or deliver products hit virtually all firms in the sector.\nTo win over the blockading truckers, who were primarily protesting high fuel prices, the government agreed to lower the average cost of fuel by 46 centavos ($0.12) per liter.\nTo pay for the cuts, the government announced it would slash a subsidy for exporters and reduce benefits for beverage makers operating in the Zona Franca low tax zone, which will hit companies such as Coca-Cola Femsa SAB de CV and Ambev SA, a unit of Anheuser Busch InBev NV.\nThose measures, along will other cost saving moves, such as reduction in tax benefits for firms in the chemical sector, will boost government coffers by 2.27 billion reais, authorities said.\nReporting by Pedro Fonseca and Gram Slattery; Editing by Grant McCool and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T18:38:59.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
