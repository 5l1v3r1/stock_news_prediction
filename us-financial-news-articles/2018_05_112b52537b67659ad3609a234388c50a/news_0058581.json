There will not be any edits, or anything hidden,” he told reporters late on Monday.\nAsked whether the report would refer to controversial elements of the MH370 case, he said: “To me, whatever elements, we will just publish it”.\nLast year, Australian authorities said the MH370 captain had flown a route on his home simulator six weeks before the disappearance that was “initially similar” to the course actually taken by the aircraft.\nPeter Foley, who led the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s search efforts, told an Australian Senate hearing “control inputs” had been made to fly the airliner off course, but he could not say if one of the pilots had done so.\nMalaysian investigators said in 2015 they had found nothing suspicious in the financial, medical or personal histories of the pilots or crew.\nFAMILIES CALL FOR REVIEW The decision to engage Ocean Infinity came after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($159 million) search across a 120,000 square-kilometre (46,332 square mile) expanse of the Indian Ocean last year.\nThis was despite investigators calling for the target area to be extended north by 25,000 square kilometres (9653 square miles).\nOcean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said on Tuesday their team had searched more than 112,000 square kilometres (43,243 square miles) of ocean floor in a little over three months.\nWhile the outcome was “extremely disappointing”, Plunkett hoped the company would be able to offer its services again in a future search for the airliner.\nVoice 370, a group representing the relatives of those aboard the flight, has pressed the new government to review all matters related to MH370, including “any possible falsification or elimination of records related to MH370 and its maintenance”.\nCalvin Shim, whose wife was a crew member on the plane, said he was concerned that the accident report would not include key information such as the plane’s full cargo manifest and the results of a separate investigation by Malaysian police.\n“We know that this issue is already four years old and a lot of people involved want closure,” he said.\n“These four years have not been fun to us, the families.”\nAustralia’s Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said the search had tested the limits of technology and capacity of experts and people at sea.\nIt would only resume if there was “credible evidence which identifies a specific location of the missing aircraft”.\n“We will always remain hopeful that one day the aircraft will be located,” McCormack’s office said in a statement.\nReporting by Rozanna Latiff; Additional reporting by Jamie Freed in SINGAPORE and Colin Packham in SYDNEY Editing by Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:13:02.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
