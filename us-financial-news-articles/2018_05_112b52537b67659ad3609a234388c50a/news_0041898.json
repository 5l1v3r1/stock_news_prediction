A.J. Minter (2-0) pitched a scoreless eighth inning and earned the victory.\nNeither starting pitcher was involved in the decision.\nAtlanta’s Brandon McCarthy allowed one run in six innings on five hits and two walks. He struck out a season-high eight. It was a nice bounce-back for McCarthy, who had been roughed up for a total of 14 runs in his previous two starts after allowing only 13 runs in six starts during March and April.\nChicago’s Tyler Chatwood pitched 5 1/3 innings and allowed one run on four hits and two walks with a season-low two strikeouts. It was the sixth time in eight starts that Chatwood allowed two runs or fewer.\nThe Braves scored a run in the first inning when Freeman slapped a single to right that scored Albies.\nAlbies, Acuna and Freeman each had two hits, accounting for six of the team’s seven hits.\nThe Cubs evened the score at 1-1 in the fifth inning. Kris Bryant singled to left field to score Ian Happ, who had hit a leadoff single and advanced on a sacrifice. Bryant went 3-for-4 and is 13-for-33 (.394) in his past nine games.\nIt was the first loss for Chicago at SunTrust Park. The Cubs were trying to go 5-0 in a new park for the first time since 1977, when they started 6-0 at Montreal’s Olympic Stadium.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:35:10.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
