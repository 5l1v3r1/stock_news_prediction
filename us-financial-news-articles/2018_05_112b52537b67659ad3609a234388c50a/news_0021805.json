I don’t think voters’ distrust has been wiped out. It is unlikely his support will bounce right up,” Iwai said.\n“It’s going to trend sideways, or dip slightly.”\nYanase acknowledged for the first time that he had met officials from the educational institution called Kake Gakuen three times in the first half of 2015.\nThe institution’s director, Kotaro Kake, is an old friend of Abe’s.\nAbe has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the affair.\nYanase, now a senior official at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, repeated an earlier assertion that he had not given Kake Gakuen any preferential treatment, and that Abe had never told him to do so.\nAbe is hoping to win a third term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader in a September vote. He needs the party top job to stay on as prime minister.\nVictory in the party poll would set Abe, who took office in 2012 pledging to reboot the economy and bolster defense, on track to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.\nBut opposition lawmakers have called for him to resign.\nThe Asahi newspaper reported last month that Yanase had told authorities in 2015 that the plan for the veterinary school in a government-designated deregulation zone was a “prime ministerial matter” and they should work hard to realize it.\nYanase denied using that term.\nReporting by Chang-Ran Kim and Kiyoshi Takenaka\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:30:15.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
