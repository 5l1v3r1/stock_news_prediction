German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks during the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the \"Women's Union\" of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Frankfurt, Germany, May 5, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nSpeaking on the 70th anniversary of her conservatives’ women’s union, Merkel said the CDU needed to boost the proportion of women in its membership above some 25 percent if it wanted to win more than 40 percent of the vote.\n“That’s why this is not just a question of women who want to make a career, but it is a survival matter for this Volkspartei,” she said.

Earlier this year, the CDU elected another woman, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is sometimes dubbed ‘mini-Merkel’, as party general-secretary, putting her in pole position to succeed Merkel as chancellor.
