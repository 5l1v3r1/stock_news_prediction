The ACLU said in January alone, ICE arrested seven while they were seeking permanent residency at a Massachusetts or Rhode Island USCIS office.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:03:06.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
