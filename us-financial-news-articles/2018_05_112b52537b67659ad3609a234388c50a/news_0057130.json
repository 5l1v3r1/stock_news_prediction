But its rate is still well below the 4.2 percent growth recorded in February.\nTo read more about this data, please click: here\nReporting by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Francesco Canepa\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/stats/md/html/index.en.html", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:20:46.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
