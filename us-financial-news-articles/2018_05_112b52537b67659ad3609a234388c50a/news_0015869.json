Russia has vehemently denied the allegations.\nMutko was banned for life from the Olympics last year as part of Russia’s punishment.\nIn recent months the 59-year-old has rolled back his involvement in sport as Russia prepares to host the soccer World Cup, which kicks off next month in 11 cities.\nHe relinquished his position as head of the tournament’s organising committee weeks after Russia was banned from the Pyeongchang Olympics for what the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said was evidence of “systemic manipulation” of anti-doping procedures at the Sochi Games.\nMutko also temporarily stepped down from his position as head of the Russian Football Union.\nMedvedev nominated Olga Golodets as the deputy prime minister overseeing sport and culture. During President Vladimir Putin’s last term, she served as deputy prime minister overseeing social policy.\nMedvedev, prime minister since 2012, resigned on Monday along with the government in line with standard procedure following Putin’s inauguration for a fourth term as president.\nPutin nominated Medvedev to run the cabinet again earlier on Monday.
