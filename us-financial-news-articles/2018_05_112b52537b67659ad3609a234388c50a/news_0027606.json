The South American nation is tackling one of the world’s highest inflation rates and a general outflow of funds from emerging market economies.\nTurning to the IMF is a politically risky move for business-friendly Macri, who was elected in late 2015 after 12 years of leftist government.\nMany Argentines blame the IMF for imposing policies on Argentina that led to a deep financial crisis in 2001 and 2002.\nThe White House said on Thursday Washington backs Macri’s reforms.\n“The United States supports the economic reform program of President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, which is market-oriented, growth-focused, and has improved Argentina’s future,” the White House said in a statement.
