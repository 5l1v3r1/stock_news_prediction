REUTERS/Choi Dae-woong/File Photo Intel is one of the biggest employers and exporters in Israel, where many of its new technologies are developed. The new investment will upgrade its Kiryat Gat manufacturing plant in southern Israel, the company said in a statement.\nIntel did not provide financial details.\nIsrael’s Finance Ministry said the company would invest about 18 billion shekels ($5 billion) in the factory between 2018-2020 and had agreed to spend 3 billion shekels on local suppliers.\nFILE PHOTO: Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo “According to company officials, this investment is expected to pave the way for a future significant investment for a technological upgrade at the Israeli site,” the ministry said in a statement.\nIn return, Intel will be granted an extension of its reduced tax rate of 5 percent until 2027. The Finance Ministry said it was also considering giving Intel a 700 million shekel grant, with a second grant of the same size to come with future investments.\n“This is to incentivize the company to carry out the future investment that could be significantly higher than past and current investments,” the ministry said.\nIntel said it exported $3.6 billion of goods and services from Israel in 2017, about 8 percent of the country’s total hi-tech exports.\nReporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:31:56.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
