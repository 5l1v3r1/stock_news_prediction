He now has 10 homers this season.\nSuter started in place of Chase Anderson, who was a late scratch with a stomach illness that will send him to the 10-day disabled list.\nFreeland (3-4) allowed four hits and four walks in 6 1/3 innings, leaving after issuing one-out walks to Jett Bandy and Jonathan Villar in the seventh.\nShaw came on to get Lorenzo Cain to ground out, and Dunn then induced Christian Yelich into a flyout to end the threat.\nFreeland struck out six in the fourth combined shutout of his career.\nThe shutout was the fifth of the season for the Colorado pitching staff. The Rockies had allowed 24 runs in their previous three games.\nSuter (2-3) was pulled after five innings, having allowed four runs and seven hits. He walked one and struck out two.\nChris Iannetta had a double and a single for the Rockies, who had suffered 5-2 and 11-10 losses to the Brewers the previous two nights.\nIannetta, Story (three) and Arenado (two) combined for seven of Colorado’s nine hits.\nSuter had the only extra-base hit, a double, for the Brewers, who were shut out for the eighth time this season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-13T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:25:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
