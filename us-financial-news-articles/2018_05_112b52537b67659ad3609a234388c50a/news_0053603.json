Further investigation showed the amount was actually around two billion dollars.\nThe money was claimed as refunds for tax deducted from stock dividends. Foreigners living outside Denmark are exempt from the 27 percent tax and are entitled to a rebate.\nCases are being brought in the United States, Britain, Canada, Malaysia and Luxembourg, according to media reports. Lauritzen declined to confirm that information.\nThe new court cases comes in addition to a continuing criminal investigation, which so far has led to confiscation of assets worth 2.7 billion Danish crowns, mostly in Germany.\nIn a related criminal case, the Danish high court on Wednesday sentenced a former employee at the tax authorities to five years in prison for corruption and dividend tax fraud. A friend of his was sentenced to four-and-a-half year in prison.
