(NYSE: TEVA, TASE: TEVA) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nMr. Kåre Schultz, Teva’s President and CEO, said \"2018 is off to a solid start. Our restructuring program is proceeding well, and we are on track to meet our cost reduction targets of $1.5 billion in 2018 and $3.0 billion by the end of 2019. During this quarter, our strong cash flow allowed us to continue to reduce our outstanding debt, and together with our recent debt issuance and covenant amendment, has placed Teva on a more stable financial footing. We have also benefited this quarter from the durability of COPAXONE and a steady flow of generic launches in the U.S. Our strong first quarter performance, along with our confidence in executing the restructuring program, gives us a solid foundation to raise our guidance for the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Results\nRevenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 10%, or 15% in local currency terms, compared to the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to adverse market dynamics in the U.S. generics market, generic competition to COPAXONE and loss of revenues following our divestment of certain products and discontinuation of certain activities.\nExchange rate differences between the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017 positively impacted our revenues by $240 million, our GAAP operating income by $37 million and our non-GAAP operating income by $46 million.\nGAAP gross profit was $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2018, down 17% compared to the first quarter of 2017. GAAP gross profit margin was 46.4% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 50.2% in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP gross profit was $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, a decline of 18% from the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 52.3% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 56.9% in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, was mainly the result of lower profitability in our North America segment due to lower COPAXONE sales and adverse market dynamics in the U.S. generics market.\nResearch and Development (R&D) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $317 million, down 27% compared to the first quarter of 2017. R&D expenses excluding equity compensation expenses and other R&D expenses were $289 million, or 5.7% of quarterly revenues in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $420 million, or 7.4%, in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in R&D expenses primarily resulted from pipeline optimization, project terminations, phase 3 studies that ended and related headcount reductions.\nSelling and Marketing (S&M) expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $771 million, a decrease of 20% compared to the first quarter of 2017. S&M expenses excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets and equity compensation expenses were $715 million, or 14.1% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $894 million, or 15.8% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction and efficiency measures as part of the restructuring plan.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $329 million, a decrease of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2017. G&A expenses excluding equity compensation expenses and other items were $322 million in the first quarter of 2018, or 6.4% of quarterly revenues, compared to $353 million, or 6.2% in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction and efficiency measures as part of the restructuring plan.\nGAAP other income in the first quarter of 2018 was $203 million, an increase of 182% compared to $72 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP other income in the first quarter of 2018 was $110 million, an increase of 53% compared to $72 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in other income was primarily the result of higher Section 8 recoveries in Canada and a $93 million net gain related to the divestment of our women’s health business, which was excluded from our non-GAAP results.\nGAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.5 billion, compared to $895 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 11% compared to the first quarter of 2017. GAAP operating margin was 30.0% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 15.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 28.7% in the first quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA (non-GAAP operating income, which excludes amortization and certain other items, as well as excluding depreciation expenses) was $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2018, down 10% compared to $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP financial expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $271 million, compared to $207 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP financial expenses were $203 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $235 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in our non-GAAP financial expenses was mainly due to an increased gain in our hedging and derivatives activities and lower interest expenses resulting from reduced overall debt, partially offset by an increase in interest and foreign exchange rates.\nGAAP income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 were $46 million, or 4%, on pre-tax income of $1.3 billion. In the first quarter of 2017, GAAP income taxes were $54 million, or 8%, on pre-tax income of $688 million. Our tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was mainly affected by one-time legal settlements and divestments that had a low corresponding tax effect. Non-GAAP income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 were $211 million on pre-tax non-GAAP income of $1.2 billion, for a quarterly tax rate of 17%. Non-GAAP income taxes in the first quarter of 2017 were $240 million on pre-tax non-GAAP income of $1.4 billion, for a quarterly tax rate of 17%.\nGAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2018 were $1.1 billion and $1.03, respectively, compared to $580 million and $0.57, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2018 were $954 million and $0.94, respectively, compared to $1.1 billion and $1.06 in the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the weighted average outstanding shares for the fully diluted EPS calculation on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was 1,020 million, compared to 1,017 million on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, no account was taken of the potential dilution by the mandatory convertible preferred shares, amounting to 64 million (including shares that may be issued due to unpaid dividends to date) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as well as for the convertible senior debentures for the respective periods, since both had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS.\nNon-GAAP information : Net non-GAAP adjustments in the first quarter of 2018 were positive $101 million. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the quarter were adjusted to exclude the following items:\nImpairments of $612 million, mainly a goodwill impairment related to Rimsa, impairment of intangible assets of product rights and IPR&D assets related to the Actavis Generics acquisition, as well as impairment for closure of manufacturing sites and other fixed assets. The impairment also includes $56 million related to a plant located in India in connection with the termination of PGT Healthcare joint venture. Impairments of equity investments of $94 million due to termination of PGT Healthcare joint venture. Amortization of purchased intangible assets totaling $310 million, of which $264 million is included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $46 million in S&M expenses; Restructuring expenses of $247 million; Financial expenses of $68 million mainly related to early redemption fees; Other non-GAAP items of $104 million; Divestment benefit of $93 million related to capital gain from the sales of our women health business; Tax benefit of $165 million; and Benefits from legal settlements of $1.3 billion mainly related to the Allergan working capital adjustments, the Rimsa settlement and the reversal of the carvedilol judgement against Teva.\nTeva believes that excluding such items facilitates investors' understanding of its business. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of the GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP figures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacement for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCash flow generated from operations during the first quarter of 2018 was $1.5 billion, compared to $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly due to proceeds from the working capital adjustment with Allergan and the legal settlement with Rimsa, compared to payments made to the SEC and DOJ in connection with the FCPA resolution in the first quarter of 2017.\nFree cash flow , excluding net capital expenditures and beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized trade receivables, was $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly due to the increase in cash flow from operations as well as lower net capital expenditures investments and higher securitized account receivables.\nAs of March 31, 2018, our total gross debt was $30.8 billion, compared to $32.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to $6.5 billion in debt prepayments, partially offset by our March 2018 issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $4.4 billion of senior notes, as well as exchange rate fluctuations. The portion of total debt classified as short-term as of March 31, 2018 was 4%, compared to 11% as of December 31, 2017.\nSegment Results for the First Quarter 2018\nDue to the organizational changes announced in November 2017, our financial results are now being reported under new segments. Our new reportable segments are:\na) North America segment, which includes the United States and Canada.\nb) Europe segment, which includes the European Union and certain other European countries.\nc) Growth Markets segment, which includes all countries other than those in our North America and Europe segments.\nIn addition to these three segments, we have other activities, primarily our API third party manufacturing business and certain contract manufacturing services.\nSegment profit is comprised of gross profit for the segment, less R&D, S&M, G&A expenses and other income related to each segment.

These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP financial expenses, non-GAAP income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS are presented in order to facilitates investors' understanding of our business. We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how we utilize the non-GAAP measures: our management and board of directors use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational performance, to compare against work plans and budgets, and ultimately to evaluate the performance of management; our annual budgets are prepared on a non-GAAP basis; and senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using these non-GAAP measures. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of the GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP figures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are not providing forward-looking guidance for GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management’s current beliefs and expectations and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause our future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from that by such Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include risks relating to:\nour ability to successfully compete in the marketplace, including: that we are substantially dependent on our generic products;
