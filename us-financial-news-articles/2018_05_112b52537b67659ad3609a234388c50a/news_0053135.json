Choosing Samsonite 1910, -9.84% as its first target, Blue Orca claimed that the company is “a mid-level brand masquerading as a premium luxury player” and that it suffers from “questionable accounting practices and poor corporate governance.”\nSamsonite’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 9.8%, its biggest one-day drop since June 2012, after the report was published. The shares climbed over 60% last year and hit a record high in April, giving the company a market value of $6.8 billion at the time. They last traded at 30.70 Hong Kong dollars per share, down 14% in the year to date.\nA representative for Samsonite didn’t immediately comment. Trading of the shares was halted Thursday morning after the report was released.
