The industry believes it can quickly re-establish its position against competitors such as Brazil.\nAmong the many issues that Washington wants resolved to improve market access and boost sales of its farm goods, poultry is \"one of the top items,\" said one of the sources who has been briefed on the matter.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not respond to requests for comment on Monday, which was a national holiday.\nChina's General Administration of Customs, which handles quarantine issues for agricultural imports, did not respond to a fax seeking comment on the issue. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a fax seeking comment.
