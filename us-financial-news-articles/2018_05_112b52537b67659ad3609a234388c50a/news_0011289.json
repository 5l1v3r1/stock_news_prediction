(Nasdaq: ACAD), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“NUPLAZID delivered strong performance in the first quarter of 2018. Sequential volume growth of 13.5% drove sequential revenue growth of 12% as health care providers and patients continue to experience the benefits of NUPLAZID in treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease psychosis,” said Steve Davis, ACADIA’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our R&D organization also continued to advance our late-stage clinical programs in four major CNS indications and we look forward to providing top-line results from our Phase 2 study of pimavanserin in major depressive disorder in the second half of 2018. We remain confident in the tremendous opportunities ahead for NUPLAZID, which is early in its growth phase.”\nRecent Highlights\nAnnounced poster presentations at the 2018 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting of clinical experience data from two independent studies of NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), including a retrospective chart review conducted by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a survey of real-life experiences conducted by researchers from the Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorder Center at Henry Ford Hospital. Reported results of a survey conducted with the Parkinson and Movement Disorder Alliance revealing the serious impact of non-movement symptoms like hallucinations and delusions on quality of life of patients with Parkinson’s disease and their caregivers. Advanced broad clinical development programs with ongoing studies in dementia-related psychosis, schizophrenia inadequate response, schizophrenia negative symptoms and major depressive disorder with plans to announce top-line results of a Phase 2 study of pimavanserin in major depressive disorder in the second half of 2018. Appointed Elena Ridloff, CFA, as Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nNet sales of NUPLAZID were $48.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 220% as compared to $15.3 million reported for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $39.3 million, compared to $35.4 million for the same period of 2017. This increase was primarily due to additional personnel and related costs, including an additional $2.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, associated with the company’s expanded research and development organization during 2018 as compared to 2017. The company also incurred increased costs related to the clinical studies associated with the development of pimavanserin.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $60.9 million, compared to $65.7 million for the same period of 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in external selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the costs of expanding our specialty sales force in the second quarter of 2017.\nNet Loss\nFor the first quarter of 2018, ACADIA reported a net loss of $54.3 million, or $0.44 per common share, compared to a net loss of $87.8 million, or $0.72 per common share, for the same period in 2017. The net loss for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 included $20.4 million and $15.6 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nCash and Investments\nAt March 31, 2018, ACADIA’s cash, cash equivalents and investment securities totaled $298.1 million, compared to $341.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Guidance\nACADIA reiterates its 2018 NUPLAZID net sales guidance to be between $255 million and $270 million.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, ACADIA expects NUPLAZID net sales to be between $57 million and $61 million.\nACADIA reiterates its expectation to end 2018 with more than $200 million of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities on its balance sheet.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nACADIA management will review its first quarter financial results and operations via conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

NUPLAZID is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis unrelated to the hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis.\nNUPLAZID is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis.\nContraindication: NUPLAZID is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to pimavanserin or any of its components. Rash, urticaria, and reactions consistent with angioedema (e.g., tongue swelling, circumoral edema, throat tightness, and dyspnea) have been reported.\nQT Interval Prolongation: NUPLAZID prolongs the QT interval. The use of NUPLAZID should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics or Class 3 antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotic medications, and certain antibiotics. NUPLAZID should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.\nAdverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (≥2% for NUPLAZID and greater than placebo) were peripheral edema (7% vs 2%), nausea (7% vs 4%), confusional state (6% vs 3%), hallucination (5% vs 3%), constipation (4% vs 3%), and gait disturbance (2% vs <1%).\nDrug Interactions: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) increase NUPLAZID concentrations. Reduce the NUPLAZID dose by one-half. Strong CYP3A4 inducers may reduce NUPLAZID exposure, monitor for reduced efficacy. Increase in NUPLAZID dosage may be needed.\nPregnancy: Use of NUPLAZID in pregnant women has not been evaluated and should therefore be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus.\nPediatric Use: Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.\nDosage and Administration: Recommended dose: 34 mg per day, taken orally as two 17-mg tablets once daily, without titration.\nFor additional Important Safety Information, including boxed warning, please see the full Prescribing Information for NUPLAZID at https://www.nuplazid.com/pdf/NUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005196/en/\nInvestor Contact:\nACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nElena Ridloff, CFA\nor\nLisa Barthelemy\n(858) 558-2871\nir@acadia-pharm.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nTaft Communications\nBob Laverty\n(609) 558-5570\nbob@taftcommunications.com\nSource: ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.nuplazid.com/pdf/NUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005196/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acadia-pharm.com&esheet=51801211&newsitemid=20180504005196&lan=en-US&anchor=www.acadia-pharm.com&index=2&md5=23c8541887b4e3b5799fcd676a46b096", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuplazid.com%2Fpdf%2FNUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf&esheet=51801211&newsitemid=20180504005196&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuplazid.com%2Fpdf%2FNUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf&index=3&md5=a7795cf534dca51e397976b6d4b7fe0d", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acadia-pharm.com&esheet=51801211&newsitemid=20180504005196&lan=en-US&anchor=www.acadia-pharm.com&index=1&md5=397e217991b9607c2827f7b46841abd6"], "published": "2018-05-04T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T15:28:51.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
