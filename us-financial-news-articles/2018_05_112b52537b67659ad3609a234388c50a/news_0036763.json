But some analysts believe the bounce may be short-lived.\nDespite an upbeat first quarter, economists still expect China’s economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, with a regulatory crackdown and a growing trade dispute with the United States seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.
