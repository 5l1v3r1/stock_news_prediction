(NYSE: AI) (the \"Company\") today announced that its Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per share of its 7.00% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Preferred Stock (NYSE: AI PrB) (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\") for the second quarter of 2018. The dividend will be payable on July 2, 2018 to shareholders of record of the Series B Preferred Stock on May 29, 2018.\nThe tax characterization to shareholders of the distribution will be determined after the end of the calendar year and will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV.

Because the Company is taxed as a C-corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, any dividends would be qualified dividends eligible for the reduced capital gains rates. Any distributions in excess of earnings and profits for the year would be classified as nontaxable returns of capital to the extent they do not exceed a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock, or as a capital gain to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock.\nAbout the Company\nArlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE: AI) is a principal investment firm that currently invests primarily in mortgage-related and other assets. The Company is headquartered in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
