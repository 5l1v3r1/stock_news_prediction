Our lithium capital projects remain on schedule, and, other than some increased raw material costs, the general market dynamics in our business remain positive.\"\nOutlook\nWith a strong start to 2018, we confirm our guidance, with an increase to our adjusted EPS outlook, as follows:\n2018 Outlook\nvs Full Year 2017\nNet sales\n$3.2 - $3.4 billion\n4% - 11%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$955 - $1,005 million\n8% - 14%\nAdjusted EPS (per diluted share)\n$5.10 - $5.40\n11% - 18%\nResults\nFirst quarter 2018 earnings were $131.8 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared to $51.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily driven by earnings growth of our Lithium segment and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.34 per diluted share recorded in 2017. First quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased by $37.3 million, or 17.7%, compared to the prior year. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income was $145.2 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to $119.0 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, for first quarter 2017, an increase of 24%. See notes to the condensed consolidated financial information for further details. The Company reported net sales of $821.6 million in first quarter 2018, up 13.8% from net sales of $722.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, driven by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes primarily in our Lithium segment and favorable price and currency exchange impacts across all three segments.\nOn April 3, 2018, we closed the sale of the polyolefin catalysts and components portion of the PCS business to W.R. Grace & Co. for net cash proceeds of approximately $416 million. The transaction includes Albemarle's Product Development Center located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and operations at the Yeosu, South Korea site. The transaction does not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the PCS business. As the sale closed in the second quarter of 2018, the assets and liabilities of this business are included in Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Segment Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the PCS product category merged with the Refining Solutions reportable segment to form a global business focused on catalysts. As a result, our three reportable segments include: (1) Lithium; (2) Bromine Specialties; and (3) Catalysts. For comparison purposes, prior year periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nLithium reported net sales of $298.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 37.8% from first quarter 2017 net sales of $216.2 million. The $81.8 million increase in net sales as compared to prior year was primarily due to favorable pricing impacts, increased sales volumes and $10.8 million of favorable currency exchange impacts. Adjusted EBITDA for Lithium was $131.0 million, an increase of 31.2% from first quarter 2017 results of $99.9 million. The $31.2 million increase in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year was primarily due to favorable pricing impacts, increased sales volumes and $1.4 million of favorable currency exchange impacts, partially offset by higher costs.\nBromine Specialties reported net sales of $225.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 2.9% from first quarter 2017 net sales of $219.2 million. The $6.4 million increase in net sales as compared to the prior year was primarily due to favorable pricing impacts and $4.3 million of favorable currency exchange impacts, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for Bromine Specialties was $70.0 million, an increase of 2.2% from first quarter 2017 results of $68.5 million. The $1.5 million increase in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year was primarily due to favorable pricing impacts and $3.8 million of favorable currency exchange impacts, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher freight costs.\nCatalysts reported net sales of $260.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 2.8% from net sales of $253.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The $7.2 million increase in net sales as compared to the prior year was primarily due to favorable pricing impacts and $4.7 million of favorable currency exchange impacts more than offsetting lower sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for Catalysts was $67.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 2.8% from first quarter 2017 results of $69.7 million. The $1.9 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher material costs and $0.8 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts, partially offset by favorable pricing impacts.\nAll Other net sales were $37.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 14.6% from net sales of $32.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The $4.7 million increase in net sales as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher sales volumes in our fine chemistry services business. All Other adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 25.1% from first quarter 2017 results of $5.2 million. The $1.3 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year was primarily due to slightly higher costs in our fine chemistry services business.\nCorporate Results\nCorporate adjusted EBITDA was a charge of $24.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a charge of $31.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in Corporate adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative spend and $1.7 million of favorable currency exchange impacts.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") was enacted, requiring companies, among other things, to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which will allow us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $2.8 million to adjust amounts previously recorded for the one-time transition tax and a discrete tax benefit of $3.7 million for other adjustments.\nOur effective income tax rates for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 of 14.7% and 22.4%, respectively, are influenced by non-recurring, other unusual and non-operating pension and OPEB items (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information). The decrease in the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 was impacted by a variety of factors, primarily stemming from discrete tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2018 related to adjustments recorded for the TCJA as noted above and excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation arrangements. Our adjusted effective income tax rates, which exclude non-recurring, other unusual and non-operating pension and OPEB items, were 23.1% and 22.4% for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and continue to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income.\nCash Flow\nOur cash from operations was approximately $121.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $39.0 million versus the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased earnings in our Lithium segment and increased dividends received from unconsolidated investments. We had $692.2 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.14 billion at December 31, 2017. During the first three months of 2018, cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded $382.8 million of commercial paper note repayments, net of borrowings, $131.8 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment and dividends to shareholders of $35.4 million.\nEarnings Call\nThe Company's performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 will be discussed on a conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern time on May 10, 2018.

OPEB items per diluted share, non-recurring and other unusual items per diluted share, adjusted effective income tax rates, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation (\"earnings\"). These measures are presented here to provide additional useful measurements to review our operations, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance. The Company's chief operating decision maker uses these measures to assess the ongoing performance of the Company and its segments, as well as for business and enterprise planning purposes.\nA description of other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to evaluate our operations and financial performance, and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP can be found on the following pages of this press release, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website at www.albemarle.com . The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, as the Company is unable to estimate significant non-recurring or unusual items without unreasonable effort. The amounts and timing of these items are uncertain and could be material to the Company's results calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Summary of Segment Results\n(In Thousands) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet sales:\nLithium\n$\n298,032\n$\n216,229\nBromine Specialties\n225,639\n219,191\nCatalysts\n260,717\n253,558\nAll Other\n37,165\n32,419\nCorporate\n76\n666\nTotal net sales\n$\n821,629\n$\n722,063\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nLithium\n$\n131,014\n$\n99,852\nBromine Specialties\n69,969\n68,488\nCatalysts\n67,830\n69,749\nAll Other\n3,862\n5,156\nCorporate\n(23,957)\n(31,869)\nTotal adjusted EBITDA\n$\n248,718\n$\n211,376\nSee accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations below.\nALBEMARLE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\n(Unaudited)\nSee below for a reconciliation of adjusted net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, the non-GAAP financial measures, to Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation (\"earnings\"), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
