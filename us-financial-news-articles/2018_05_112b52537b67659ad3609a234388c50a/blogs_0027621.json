That growth came just 9 months after SoftBank used its Vision Fund to invest about $2.5 billion in Flipkart.\nA spokeswoman for SoftBank in India declined comment.\nFormer Amazon employees Sachin and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 and, just like Amazon, began by selling books.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T11:00:31.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
