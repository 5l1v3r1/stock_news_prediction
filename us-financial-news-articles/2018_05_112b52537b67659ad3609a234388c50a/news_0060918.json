We are pleased to have taken delivery of the final five Capesize vessels in our newbuilding program as we continue to grow and modernize our operating fleet. As market conditions improve, we are well positioned to generate substantial cash flow with a large, modern fleet and competitive cash break-even levels.\"\nPer Heiberg, Chief Financial Officer of Golden Ocean Management AS, commented:\n\"Our new $120 million loan facility that refinanced 10 vessels was completed on attractive terms.
