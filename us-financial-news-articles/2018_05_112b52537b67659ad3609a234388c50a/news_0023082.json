(NYSE:AG) (TSX:FR) (the \"Company\" or “First Majestic”) is pleased to announce the unaudited interim consolidated financial results of the Company for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The full version of the financial statements and the management discussion and analysis can be viewed on the Company's web site at www.firstmajestic.com or on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov . All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nSilver equivalent production amounted to 3.9 million ounces Revenues for the quarter was $58.6 million Mine operating earnings of ($0.4) million Cash flow per share was $0.09 per share (non-GAAP) Cash costs were $7.83 per payable silver ounce (net of by-product credits) All-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) were $16.01 per payable silver ounce Net loss of $5.6 million (Basic loss per share of $0.03) Realized average silver price of $16.76 per ounce, relatively consistent with the prior quarter During the quarter, the Company repurchased and cancelled 230,000 common shares in the open market for a total consideration of $1.3 million through its normal course issuer bid Healthy balance sheet with $249.2 million in cash and cash equivalents following the $156.5 million five-year, 1.875% interest rate convertible debenture offering in January 2018\n“In the first quarter, lower production rates resulted in a slight decrease in revenues and cash flows compared to the prior quarter,” stated Keith Neumeyer, President and CEO of First Majestic. “This temporary decrease in production, which was primarily due to lower head grades, naturally resulted in higher cash costs per ounce. Nevertheless, we managed to beat our overall cost guidance during the quarter due to strong gold production at the Santa Elena, San Martin and La Guitarra operations. Looking ahead, we plan to provide an updated production, costs and capital expenditure guidance in July to reflect the integration of the San Dimas operation. We remain focused on developing our key growth projects, most importantly our roaster project, which is expected to significantly increase silver production at La Encantada in the second half of 2018.”\nOPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nKey Performance Metrics 2018-Q1 2017-Q4 Change\nQ1 vs Q4 2017-Q1 Change\nQ1 vs Q1 Operational Ore Processed / Tonnes Milled 809,775 736,684 10% 822,336 (2%) Silver Ounces Produced 2,167,030 2,337,463 (7%) 2,708,978 (20%) Silver Equivalent Ounces Produced 3,879,678 4,065,337 (5%) 4,267,350 (9%) Cash Costs per Ounce (1) $7.83 $6.76 16% $6.31 24% All-in Sustaining Cost per Ounce (1) $16.01 $14.13 13% $11.85 35% Total Production Cost per Tonne (1) $46.88 $50.81 (8%) $44.72 5% Average Realized Silver Price per Ounce (1) $16.76 $16.61 1% $17.55 (5%) Financial (in $millions) Revenues $58.6 $61.2 (4%) $69.1 (15%) Mine Operating (Loss) Earnings ($0.4) $1.4 (130%) $10.0 (104%) Net (Loss) Earnings ($5.6) ($56.1) (90%) $2.7 (306%) Operating Cash Flows before Working Capital and Taxes $15.6 $18.7 (17%) $26.6 (41%) Cash and Cash Equivalents $249.2 $118.1 111% $127.6 95% Working Capital (1) $235.6 $116.3 103% $136.8 72% Shareholders (Loss) Earnings per Share (\"EPS\") - Basic ($0.03) ($0.34) (90%) $0.02 (304%) Adjusted EPS (1) $0.06) ($0.04) 53% $0.02 (372%) Cash Flow per Share (1) $0.09 $0.11 (16%) $0.16 (42%) (1) The Company reports non-GAAP measures which include cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining cost per ounce, total production cost per ounce, total production cost per tonne, average realized silver price per ounce, working capital, adjusted EPS and cash flow per share. These measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nThe Company realized an average silver price of $16.76 per ounce during the first quarter of 2018, representing a 5% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2017 and relatively consistent compared to $16.61 in the prior quarter.\nRevenues generated in the first quarter totaled $58.6 million, a decrease of 15% compared to $69.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to an 11% decrease in silver equivalent ounces sold and a 5% decrease in average realized silver price compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nThe Company reported a mine operating loss of $0.4 million compared to mine operating earnings of $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in mine operating earnings was primarily affected by the decrease in revenue combined with higher labour and energy costs as a result of a stronger Mexican peso which appreciated 10% compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nCash flow from operations before movements in working capital and income taxes in the quarter was $15.6 million ($0.09 per share) compared to $26.6 million ($0.16 per share) in the first quarter of 2017. Cash flows are expected to increase in the second half of 2018 with the start up of the 2,000 tpd roasting circuit at La Encantada and increased mine production from the high-grade San Javier breccia.\nThe Company generated a net loss of $5.6 million (loss per share of $0.03) compared to net earnings of $2.7 million (EPS of $0.02) in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in mine operating earnings. Excluding all non-cash and non-recurring items, the Company generated an adjusted loss of $10.1 million (adjusted loss of $0.06 per share) during the quarter.\nThe Company maintains a strong treasury with $249.2 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter, reflecting a 111% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in cash was driven by the $156.5 million five-year convertible bond offering in January 2018 which will be used primarily for repayment of Primero’s existing convertible debentures, other costs related to the closing of the Arrangement and general working capital purposes. Furthermore, the Company’s working capital position increased 103% to $235.6 million compared to $116.3 million at the end of the year.\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThe table below represents the quarterly operating and cost parameters at each of the Company’s six producing silver mines.\nFirst Quarter Production Summary Santa Elena La Encantada La Parrilla Del Toro San Martin La Guitarra Consolidated Ore Processed / Tonnes Milled 223,498 276,191 125,114 79,769 75,374 29,829 809,775 Silver Ounces Produced 521,784 449,522 337,332 236,478 483,740 138,173 2,167,030 Silver Equivalent Ounces Produced 1,543,776 452,420 615,541 437,743 574,838 255,359 3,879,678 Cash Costs per Ounce ($4.74) $16.93 $11.02 $13.66 $8.04 $7.97 $7.83 All-in Sustaining Cost per Ounce ($0.17) $20.97 $17.66 $20.61 $9.98 $15.76 $16.01 Total Production Cost per Tonne $54.31 $27.00 $48.12 $58.12 $68.06 $86.50 $46.88 Total production for the quarter was 3,879,678 silver equivalent ounces, consisting of 2,167,030 ounces of silver, 15,887 ounces of gold, 4,448,378 pounds of lead and 1,611,699 pounds of zinc. The most significant production increase occurred at the Del Toro operations which recorded an 18% increase in silver equivalents ounces produced as higher production rates were achieved from the Dolores mine following ventilation upgrades.\nCOSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCash cost per ounce for the quarter was $7.83 per payable ounce of silver, an increase of 16% from $6.76 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash cost per ounce was higher primarily due to lower head grades in the quarter and also the year-end recognition of $2.4 million in diesel credits in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash costs at La Encantada are expected to decrease in the second half of 2018 with the anticipated increase in silver grades as higher production rates are achieved from the San Javier breccia. The San Javier area is expected to reach production rates of 600 tpd by mid-2018 and produce silver grades between 150 to 200 g/t.\nAISC in the first quarter was $16.01, an increase of 13% or $1.88 per ounce compared to the previous quarter, primarily attributed to an increase in cash costs and higher general and administrative expenses due to corporate transformation training focusing on high performance teams and operational efficiency.\nTotal capital expenditures in the first quarter were $20.1 million, primarily consisting of $4.8 million at Santa Elena, $3.5 million at La Encantada, $3.1 million at La Parrilla, $2.4 million at Del Toro, $2.1 million at San Martin and $2.2 million at La Guitarra.\nCORPORATE UPDATE\nOn May 7, 2018, the Company received application approval from the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica (“COFECE”) related to the Mexican anti-trust ruling on the acquisition of Primero Mines. The anti-trust decision was the final approval required to close the transaction. Having received the final government approval, the Company now expects closing to occur as early as May 10, 2018.\nTogether with First Majestic's existing six operating silver mines in Mexico, the combined company is expected to approximately double its production of silver equivalent ounces per year. Following the closing of the transaction, First Majestic will provide an updated 2018 guidance report which will include production, cost and capital expenditure estimates for the San Dimas mine as well as updated estimates for the six current producing operations.\nPROJECTS UPDATE\nAt the end of the quarter, the construction of the roaster project at the La Encantada Silver Mine was 79% complete. During the quarter, the mounting of the roasting furnace, rotary dryer, cyclones, grate cooler and fans were completed. A new metallurgical lab is currently being constructed to support the roasting plant operation. Commissioning remains on schedule for the end of the second quarter and ramping up to commercial production by the end of the third quarter. Once at full capacity, annual doré production at La Encantada is expected to exceed 4.0 million ounces of silver, or an increase of approximately 1.5 million ounces of silver per year.\nDuring the quarter, the manufacturing of the full-scale microbubble flotation cells for La Parrilla began and is expected to take approximately seven months to complete. Delivery and installation of the cells is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 followed by commissioning and ramp up to commercial production by year end. By using microbubble technology, the Company expects to achieve higher metallurgical recoveries in the treatment of sulphide ore within the flotation circuit at La Parrilla.\nThe Company's underground development in the first quarter consisted of 14,914 metres, reflecting a 4% increase compared to 14,279 metres completed in the previous quarter. Underground development continued to focus on opening new production areas at La Parrilla, opening new faces at La Guitarra, new stopes at Del Toro, and developing into higher grade zones at La Encantada as a way to increase production in the coming quarters.\nA total of 20 diamond drill rigs were active across the Company's properties and completed 44,827 metres of diamond drilling in the quarter, representing a 10% decrease compared to the prior quarter. The most significant results were obtained at Cerro de Santiago in La Parrilla where two holes intercepted the Santiago epithermal vein at 480 metres at depth. Hole SLP-CS-18-01 intercepted 0.6 metres of estimated true-thickness (ETT) with 440 g/t of Ag and 1.1 g/t of Au and 3.1 metres (ETT) with 490 g/t of Ag and 1.2 g/t of Au. Additionally, hole SLP-CS-18-02 intercepted 2.8 metres (ETT) of mineralized epithermal vein approximately 150 metres south of hole 01 but grades are still not available. Other significant results were obtained in Santa Elena were hole EW-18-12 intercepted the Ermitaño vein with 8.0 metres (ETT) and hole EW-18-15 intercepted the Aitana vein with 7.1 metres (ETT).\nABOUT FIRST MAJESTIC\nFirst Majestic is a mining company focused on silver production in Mexico and is aggressively pursuing the development of its existing mineral property assets.
