He comes from a highly successful program and has enjoyed success at both (provincial) and Super Rugby level.”\nSamu made his debut for the Crusaders in 2016 and has proved himself to be a valuable squad member, able to play at blindside flanker or number eight.\nIf named in Cheika’s squad he would give the Wallabies a strong ball-carrying presence in the loose forwards they have been lacking in recent years, particularly if teamed with Michael Hooper and David Pocock in the back row.\n“I am thrilled by the challenge of joining the Brumbies and am looking forward to taking to the field for the club,” Samu said.\n“The Brumbies are well-renowned throughout Super Rugby for being a successful club and for having a fantastic playing culture.\n“I’d like to thank the Crusaders for giving me a chance at this level and wish them all the best for the future.”\nThe Wallabies face Ireland next month in a three-match test series, starting in Brisbane on June 9.
