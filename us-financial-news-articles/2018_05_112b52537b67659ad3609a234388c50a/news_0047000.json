For instance, Brazil is expected to sell about 73 million tonnes of soybeans in export markets this season, according to projections by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\nTransport lobby CNT, which estimates that 60 percent of Brazil’s cargo is moved by truckers, called for a revision of the pricing policy of Brazil’s state-controlled oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA.\n“Brazil’s diesel fuel is more expensive than in countries at a similar stage of development like Russia and Mexico,” CNT said in a Wednesday statement, adding that local prices are on average about 15 percent higher than in the United States.\nDiesel fuel prices at the pump rose between 13 percent and 15 percent in the key agricultural and industrial states of Mato Grosso, São Paulo and Paraná between January 2017 and May 2018, Esalq said in its study.\nThe federal government and a group representing truck drivers met for talks Wednesday afternoon, but failed to make any progress on ending the protests snarling traffic nationwide .\nThe impasse continued despite Petrobras on Wednesday lowering diesel prices for a second time this week.\n$1 = 3.6238 reais Reporting by Ana Mano Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:41:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
