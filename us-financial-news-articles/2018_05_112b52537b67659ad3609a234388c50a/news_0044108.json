REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\nThe CEO of an S&P 500 company, on average, earned $13.94 million (10.4 million pounds) in 2017, 361 times more than the average worker, according to AFL-CIO, the largest federation of U.S. labour unions. ( bit.ly/2LlR3xZ )\n“This year’s report provides further proof of America’s income inequality crisis,” said AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Liz Shuler.\nThe average production and nonsupervisory worker earned some $38,613 per year, according to the federation’s data.\nThe average wage has remained stagnant for more than 50 years, when adjusted for inflation, the federation said.\nThe labour group’s annual study often draws notice as a measure of how U.S. workers are largely not sharing the economic gains of those at the top of the income scale, even as official unemployment remains low.\nThe federation has cited an increase in outsourcing of good-paying American jobs as the reason for the stagnancy.\n“Our economy works best when consumers have money to spend. That means raising wages for workers and reining in out-of-control executive pay” Shuler added.
