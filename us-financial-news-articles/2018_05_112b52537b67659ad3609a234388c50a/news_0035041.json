One of the Democrats, Senator Bob Menendez, said Fannon had lobbied against comprehensive climate change legislation and against limits on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico put in place after BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, that killed 11 platform workers.\n“Energy security rests in energy diversification, innovation, and development of zero and low carbon energy sources,” Menendez said at the hearing. “The appointment of an oil and gas lobbyist to this position demonstrates a backwards outlook on energy policy.”\nBefore working in corporations, Fannon served as counsel to the Senate environment committee and as an aide to two Republican senators.\nIn a hearing before the panel’s vote, Fannon said that he had drafted provisions of the 2005 energy bill that helped unleash innovation and set the conditions for U.S. energy abundance today.
