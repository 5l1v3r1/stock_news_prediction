In particular, immediate fears of a trade war were likely put to rest after U.S. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that the countries were \"putting the trade war on hold\" as they worked out an agreement.\nBoth countries said they had agreed to \"substantially reduce\" the U.S. trade deficit with China in a joint statement on Saturday. According to the statement, China would significantly increase its purchases of U.S. goods and services, although it remained unclear how much that would amount to.\n\"Overall, markets should view this positively at the open this week, but will continue to be attentive to further developments,\" ANZ analysts said in a morning note.\nAlthough Mnuchin's pronouncement was an incremental positive, there were also other moving parts at play in markets, said Jonathan Garner, chief Asia and emerging markets equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\nHigher oil prices were \"negative for most of Asia, which is a large oil importer ... We also have a situation where monetary policy continues to tighten in the U.S. and China simultaneously, and that's an issue that's certainly causing pressure on valuations, particularly in equities,\" Garner told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nU.S. stock index futures, meanwhile, were higher on Monday following Mnuchin's comments, with the implied open for the Dow Jones industrial average more than 200 points higher during Asia morning trade.
