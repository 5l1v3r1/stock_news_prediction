The interest from the endocrinology community across the United States has been significant; the enthusiasm to adopt a safe, simple and accurate drug to use in their assessment of AGHD has reinforced our optimism about the market potential for MACRILEN,” said Matthew Pauls, president and chief executive officer of Strongbridge Biopharma. “We also delivered solid first quarter revenues for KEVEYIS® (dichlorphenamide) and given these results, along with our expectation for continued strong commercial execution for the balance of the year, we increased our full year KEVEYIS revenue guidance for 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 & Recent Company Highlights:\nCorporate & Commercial:\nAchieved KEVEYIS net product sales of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 30 percent increase compared to $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Increased full-year 2018 revenue guidance for KEVEYIS from $16 to $19 million to $18 to $20 million. Acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to MACRILEN in January 2018, expanding the Company’s footprint in the rare endocrine therapeutic category. In preparation for the planned MACRILEN launch in July, hired 15 of 16 sales representatives; in the process of hiring two regional business directors and four field reimbursement managers. Strengthened intellectual property portfolio with second method of use patent issued for RECORLEV by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nClinical Development and Medical Affairs:\nPresented new clinical analyses for KEVEYIS at the 70th American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting. Hired two of three medical science liaisons in preparation for the planned MACRILEN launch. Top-line results for SONICS remain on track for mid-year 2018. Held Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting at the end of April at which the DSMB recommended that the Phase 3 SONICS study continue as planned with no protocol changes. Dosed the initial patients and continued activating sites for the Phase 3 LOGICS study. Presented results from an in vitro study of levoketoconazole, the active ingredient in RECORLEV, at ENDO 2018, the Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society; these data demonstrated that levoketoconazole is the clinically active half of ketoconazole with regard to cortisol and androgen synthesis inhibition.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, basic and diluted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders on a GAAP basis was $28.7 million, or $0.66 per share, compared to a basic net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $29.5 million, or $0.83 per share, for the same period in 2017. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the same period in 2017 primarily due to net revenues recorded in 2018 from sales of KEVEYIS, which was launched in April 2017, and a lower unrealized loss on the fair value of warrants recorded in 2018, offset in part by increased operating expenses associated with the commercialization of KEVEYIS.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $14.3 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to a non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $10.4 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same period in 2017. The increase in non-GAAP net loss was primarily due to increased operating expenses associated with the commercialization of KEVEYIS, which was launched in April 2017, offset in part by net revenues recorded from KEVEYIS product sales.\nThe Company recorded net revenues from sales of KEVEYIS, which was launched in April 2017, of $3.9 million and cost of goods sold of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. No revenue or cost of goods sold was recognized for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increase during the 2018 period was primarily due to expenses related to the RECORLEV LOGICS clinical trial.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $12.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.4 million for the same period in 2017. The increase during the 2018 period was primarily due to costs incurred to establish the commercial and corporate infrastructure necessary to support the launch and ongoing commercialization of KEVEYIS.\nStrongbridge had $92.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $86.5 million in outstanding debt as of March 31, 2018, compared to $57.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $40.0 million in outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes the combination of existing cash resources and potential additional borrowings available under its credit facility will provide sufficient cash resources under its current operating plan, which includes the commercial launch of MACRILEN and the potential U.S. regulatory approval and launch of RECORLEV, to achieve consistent positive cash flows from operating activities.\nConference Call Information\nStrongbridge will host a conference call on Thursday, May 10 at 8:30 a.m. ET.
