REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo\nIrish voters will be asked on May 25 whether to liberalise the abortion laws. It is the first opportunity in 35 years to overhaul one of the world’s strictest regimes, which has long divided the once deeply Catholic nation.\nThe Irish Times/MRBI poll found that 44 percent would vote to repeal an amendment to the constitution that enshrines the equal right to life of the mother and her unborn child, with 32 percent opposed.\nA further 17 percent are undecided, with 5 percent not intending to vote and 2 percent refusing to answer. Of the undecided voters, 31 percent said they were “leaning towards” repealing, with 24 percent leaning toward keeping the amendment.
