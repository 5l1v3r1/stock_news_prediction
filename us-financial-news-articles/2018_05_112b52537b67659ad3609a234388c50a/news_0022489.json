(NASDAQ:EBIX), a leading international supplier of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance, financial, e-governance and healthcare industries, today reported results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Ebix will host a conference call to review its results today at 11:00 a.m. EDT (details below).\nEbix delivered the following results for the first quarter of 2018:\nRevenue: Q1 2018 revenue rose 37% to $108.2 million compared to $79.1 million in Q1 2017 and increased 3% over Q4 2017 revenue of $104.7 million. The year over year revenue improvement reflected growth in the Company’s Exchange channel as well as higher revenue from the Risk Compliance channel, with the revenues from the EbixCash Financial Exchange reflected in the Exchange channel.\nOn a constant currency basis, Ebix Q1 2018 revenue increased 35% to $107.2 million compared to $79.1 million in Q1 2017. The Exchange channel continued to be Ebix’s largest, accounting for 76% of Q1 2018 revenues.\n(dollar amounts in thousands) Channel Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change Exchanges $ 81,858 $ 52,614 +56 % Risk Compliance Solutions (RCS) 22,267 21,852 +2 % Broker Solutions 3,610 3,788 -5 % Carrier Systems 495 849 -42 % Total Revenue $ 108,230 $ 79,103 +37 % Total Revenue on Constant Currency Basis $ 107.2 $ 79.1M +35 % Operating Income and Margins: Q1 2018 operating margins decreased to 31% as compared to 32% in Q1 2017. Operating income for Q1 2018 rose 32% to $33.9 million compared to $25.7 million in Q1 2017.\nNet Income : Q1 2018 net income decreased 1% to $26.2 million compared to $26.4 million in Q1 2017, despite the 32% increase in operating income. The decrease principally reflected an $8.4 million increase in non-operating expenses like foreign exchange loss, net interest charges and tax expense from Q1 2017 to Q1 2018, as follows:\na $0.6 million foreign exchange loss in Q1 2018 vs. a gain of $3.5 million in Q1 2017 a $3.0 million increase in net interest expense in Q1 2018 vs. Q1 2017 a $2.1 million tax expense in Q1 2018 vs. $0.9 million in Q1 2017. The Q1 2018 taxes reflect a provision for the Global Intangible Low- Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax, as per the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nEarnings per Share: Q1 2018 diluted earnings per share were unchanged from Q1 2017 at $0.83. Ebix’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 31.7 million in Q1 2018 compared to 32.0 million in Q1 2017 and 31.7 million in Q4 2017, reflecting the benefit of share repurchase activity.\nOperating Cash: Cash generated from operations rose $9.7 million or 61% in Q1 2018 to $25.5 million compared to $15.8 million in Q1 2017. Q1 2018 cash flows reflected cumulative cash payment of $11.0 million for bank interest and income tax, including non-recurring advance Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) payments in India.\nShare Repurchases: In Q1 2018, Ebix repurchased 30,000 shares of its outstanding common stock for aggregate cash consideration of $2.2 million that were settled in April 2018.\nQ2 2018 Diluted Share Count: As of today, Ebix expects its diluted share count for Q2 2018 to be approximately 31.7 million.\nDividend: Ebix paid its regularly quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in Q1 2018 for a total cost of $2.4 million.\nEbix Chairman, President and CEO Robin Raina said, “We are pleased to start 2018 with record revenue and operating income and a 61% increase in cash generated from operations. With a worldwide annualized revenue run rate of approximately $433 million as of Q1 2018, we believe that we are well on track to surpass our half a Billion-dollar annualized revenue run rate aspirational goal by year end or perhaps earlier.”\nRobin said, “From a business development standpoint, Q1 was strong as we secured a few substantial contracts that involve implementations that should contribute to our results over the balance of 2018 and 2019. We faced head winds in Q1 2018 that impacted our sequential revenue comparison with Q4 2017 by $5 million, including a $4 million reduction in our Continuing Education and Health administration exchange segment in Q1 2018, related to seasonal revenue increases in Q4 2017, and approximately $1 million in lower transaction volumes in Q1 2018 because of certain regulatory guidelines associated with the new “Know Your Customer” rule implementation in India. We are pleased that in spite of those factors, Ebix achieved a $3.6 million sequential revenue improvement in Q1 2018 as compared to Q4 2017.”\n“Our Indian operations continue to grow in terms of top line and bottom line both. Our EbixCash retail outlet count in India is now approaching 260,000 and we have over 500 sales people on the ground committed to organically growing our outlet footprint as well as the customer penetration of our EbixCash business. With India business contributing $32.9 million in revenues in Q1 2018 as compared to $5.6 million in Q1 2017, we are now targeting an annualized revenue run rate of $200 million or more by Q4 2018.”\nSean Donaghy, Ebix CFO said, “In Q1 2018 Ebix continued to demonstrate solid cash generation to fund growth and investor friendly initiatives, with cash flow from operations increasing to $25.5 million. During Q1 2018, we spent $9.7 million on dividends, tax payments and building construction. Specifically, in Q1 2018 we paid taxes of $6.8 million; invested $531 thousand on building capex; invested $6.6 million for the purchase of the Transcorp inward remittance assets; and returned $2.4 million in dividends to shareholders, while we drew only $20.0 million from our Bank credit facilities. Ebix ended the quarter with $130.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $40.8 million as compared to December 31, 2017.”\nConference Call Details:\nCall Date/Time: Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. EDT\nCall Dial-In: +1-877-837-3909 or 1-973-409-9690; Call ID # 7585634\nLive Audio Webcast: www.ebix.com/webcast\nAudio Replay URL: www.ebix.com/result_18_Q1 after 2:00 p.m. EDT on May 9 th\nAbout Ebix, Inc.\nWith 50+ offices across 5 continents, Ebix, Inc., (NASDAQ:EBIX) endeavors to provide On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance, financial and healthcare industries.
