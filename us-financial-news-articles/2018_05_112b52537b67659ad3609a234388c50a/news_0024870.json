REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\nThe European Union needed to integrate more closely in the face of outside threats and resurgent nationalism within its borders. That included establishing a standalone euro zone budget he said, after receiving a German prize for his contribution to European unification.\nIn terms of their recipe for Europe, Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are broadly aligned on migration, defense and security.
