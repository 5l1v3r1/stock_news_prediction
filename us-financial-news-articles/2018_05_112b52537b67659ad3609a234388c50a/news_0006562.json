REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte\nWork on the $1.4 billion Port City project by China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) ( 601800.SS ) started in 2016 as part of Beijing’s ambitious plans to create a modern-day “Silk Road” linking Asia to the Middle East and Europe.\nThe project is expected to attract $13 billion in investment over next 20 years.\nLiang Thow Ming, chief sales and marketing officer of CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd, the local company that handles the project for CCCC, said 80 percent of the 269-hectare (665-acre) site had been reclaimed from the sea.

We are talking about for hospitality, commercial offices, retail space, and residential. We have seen investors from Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, China and Japan.”\nHe declined to identify specific investors, but said the Port City would see $3-4 billion investment “if everything comes true”.\n“We are looking for partners with international image on the project. There is a healthy demand at the moment.”\nThe Sri Lankan government has said a consortium led by state-run China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd will invest $1 billion to build three, 60-storey office towers on reclaimed land at Port City, while CCCC is expected to invest $800 million to build an underground road network.,\nSri Lanka has been preparing legislation with tax incentives to lure investment to the Port City, which includes housing, marinas, health facilities and schools.\nCHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd aims to deliver the first site for construction by the end of 2018.
