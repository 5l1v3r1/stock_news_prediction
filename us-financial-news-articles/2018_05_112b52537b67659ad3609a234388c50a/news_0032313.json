It has been building a cash buffer and wants to be able to service its debt with funds raised directly from the markets.\n“We aim to successfully conclude the fourth review to reach a comprehensive agreement for the country’s ‘clean exit’ from the third bailout programme within June,” Tzanakopoulos said.\nA finance ministry official said the review was likely to be finally wrapped up in June. Athens also hopes to reach a deal with its lenders before July on further debt relief, which will be implemented in the post-bailout period.\nSince 2010, Greece has received about 260 billion euros in bailout loans in exchange for tough austerity and reforms. The bailout loans have kept it afloat but have also helped balloon its debt, which now stands at 180 percent of GDP.\nThe IMF, which estimates lower economic growth for Greece than its European lenders and has not released any loans since 2014, has also been pushing for a debt reprofiling, saying it is necessary for the country’s debt to be sustainable.\nTo convince the IMF to participate in its third bailout programme, as demanded by some European Union members, Greece was forced to legislate for pension cuts and tax hikes that will be implemented in 2019 and 2020, after the end of its bailout.\n“I believe that we will know whether the IMF will join or not by the end of the month, or in early June,” said the finance ministry official, who requested anonymity.
