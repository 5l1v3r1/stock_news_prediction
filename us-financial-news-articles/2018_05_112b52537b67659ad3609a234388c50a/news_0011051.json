The 2017 EBITDA figure does not include the gain from our sale of ownership in D&D. We base the calculation of earnings per share on net income after tax and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.\n2018 First Quarter Results of Operations\nTotal revenue was $26.9 million, up $5.4 million (+25.0%) compared to Q1 2017. Registry Operations segment revenue was $16.9 million, flat compared to Q1 2017. Land Registry revenue was $11.8 million, up $82 thousand (+0.7%) versus Q1 2017. Personal Property Registry was $2.4 million, up $24 thousand (+1.0%) compared to Q1 2017. Corporate Registry revenue was $2.7 million, down $0.1 million (-4.0%) compared to Q1 2017. Services segment revenue was $8.9 million, up $5.1 million (+136.3%) compared to 2017. Technology Solutions segment revenue was $4.9 million, up $0.4 million (+8.5%) compared to Q1 2017. Consolidated expenses (all segments) were $22.6 million (+28.7%) compared to $17.6 million for Q1 2017. Net income was $2.6 million or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, compared to $2.4 million or $0.14 per basic and diluted share for Q1 2017. Capital expenditures were $0.4 million compared to $0.1 million in Q1 2017. As at March 31, 2018, the Company held $27.2 million in cash, compared to $31.3 million as at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.1 million. Debt for the three months ended March 31, 2018, remained at $21.6 million compared to December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nThe following section includes forward-looking information, including statements related to the industries in which we operate, growth opportunities and our future financial position and results including expected revenue, EBITDA and capital expenditures. Refer to section 3 “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information” in our Management Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nOn a consolidated basis, ISC continues to expect total revenue of between $124.0 and $130.0 million with an EBITDA margin of between 24.0 per cent and 26.0 per cent. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin, which adjusts for stock-based compensation expense or income, stock option expense, transactional gains and losses on assets, and acquisition and integration costs, is expected to be between 26.0 and 28.0 percent, in line with historical adjustments. It should be noted that the acquisition of AVS in December 2017, with a high revenue, lower margin profile, changes ISC’s consolidated revenue and EBITDA margin profile compared to previous years. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $4.0 million and $6.0 million and will be funded through operating cash flow.\nWe see two factors influencing the outlook for our Registry Operations segment, specifically the Saskatchewan Land Registry, those being changes to the mortgage rules and an increase in overnight lending rates. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) implemented revisions to its mortgage rules effective on January 1, 2018 , which now include a requirement to “stress test” borrowers with uninsured loans to ensure they could withstand increases in interest rates. Interest rate changes often influence consumer behaviour and, as such, may affect ISC’s business. Given these factors, along with our observed first quarter transaction levels, we expect that softening in the Saskatchewan market may continue. This may impact the overall results from our Registry Operations segment in 2018, absent any additional high value transactions beyond the historical average currently incorporated into our forecast.\nIn our Services segment, we expect to see further customer growth in Financial Support Services in 2018, due to onboarding of new customers in our Services segment and our recent acquisition of AVS. We will continue to invest in our core Services technology platforms to enable integrated solutions in conjunction with its AVS technology in the year ahead.\nFollowing the addition of new business during the quarter in the Company’s newest reporting segment, Technology Solutions, the Company expects to see modest revenue growth in this segment, largely made up of implementation fees associated with new contracts. Following each implementation, revenue will be based on service fees over the life of the contracts. We will continue to pursue new business opportunities in this segment in 2018, while simultaneously investing in RegSys to enhance the platform.\nThe key drivers of our expenses will continue to be wages and salaries, information technology costs as well as the pursuit of new business opportunities.\nNote to Readers\nThe Board of Directors (“Board”) carries out its responsibility for review of this disclosure primarily through the Audit Committee, which is comprised exclusively of independent directors.
