Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter increased 30% to $1.95 from $1.50 in the prior-year quarter. Excluding certain items affecting comparability (1) , EPS for the quarter increased 23% to $1.84 from $1.50 in the prior-year quarter. EPS for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased to $4.86 from $3.05 in the prior-year period. Excluding certain items affecting comparability (1) , EPS for the six months increased 22% to $3.73 from $3.05 in the prior-year period.\n“Driven by strong results in our parks and resorts and studio businesses, our Q2 performance reflects our continued ability to drive significant shareholder value,” said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company. “Our ability to create extraordinary content like Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War and leverage it across all business units, the unique value proposition we’re creating for consumers with our DTC platforms, and our recent reorganization strengthen our confidence that we are very well positioned for future growth.”\nThe following table summarizes the second quarter and six-month results for fiscal 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts):\nQuarter Ended Six Months Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change Revenues $ 14,548 $ 13,336 9 % $ 29,899 $ 28,120 6 % Segment operating income (1) $ 4,237 $ 3,996 6 % $ 8,223 $ 7,952 3 % Net income (2) $ 2,937 $ 2,388 23 % $ 7,360 $ 4,867 51 % Diluted EPS (2) $ 1.95 $ 1.50 30 % $ 4.86 $ 3.05 59 % EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability (1) $ 1.84 $ 1.50 23 % $ 3.73 $ 3.05 22 % Cash provided by operations $ 4,526 $ 3,228 40 % $ 6,763 $ 4,673 45 % Free cash flow (1) $ 3,463 $ 2,345 48 % $ 4,719 $ 2,750 72 % (1)\nEPS excluding certain items affecting comparability, segment operating income and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See the discussion on pages 7 through 9. The most significant item affecting comparability for the current quarter and six-month period was a net benefit from new U.S. federal income tax legislation (Tax Act) resulting from remeasuring our deferred tax balances to a new lower U.S. statutory rate, partially offset by the accrual of a Deemed Repatriation Tax (see page 5 for further discussion).\n(2)\nReflects amounts attributable to shareholders of The Walt Disney Company, i.e. after deduction of noncontrolling interests.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe following table summarizes the second quarter and six-month segment operating results for fiscal 2018 and 2017 (in millions):\nQuarter Ended Six Months Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change Revenues: Media Networks $ 6,138 $ 5,946 3 % $ 12,381 $ 12,179 2 % Parks and Resorts 4,879 4,299 13 % 10,033 8,854 13 % Studio Entertainment 2,454 2,034 21 % 4,958 4,554 9 % Consumer Products & Interactive Media 1,077 1,057 2 % 2,527 2,533 — % $ 14,548 $ 13,336 9 % $ 29,899 $ 28,120 6 % Segment operating income: Media Networks $ 2,082 $ 2,223 (6\n)\n%\n$ 3,275 $ 3,585 (9\n)\n%\nParks and Resorts 954 750 27 % 2,301 1,860 24 % Studio Entertainment 847 656 29 % 1,676 1,498 12 % Consumer Products & Interactive Media 354 367 (4\n)\n%\n971 1,009 (4\n)\n%\n$ 4,237 $ 3,996 6 % $ 8,223 $ 7,952 3 % Media Networks\nMedia Networks revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $6.1 billion and segment operating income decreased 6% to $2.1 billion.\nThe following table provides further detail of the Media Networks results (in millions):\nQuarter Ended Six Months Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change Revenues: Cable Networks $ 4,252 $ 4,062 5 % $ 8,745 $ 8,490 3 % Broadcasting 1,886 1,884 — % 3,636 3,689 (1\n)\n%\n$ 6,138 $ 5,946 3 % $ 12,381 $ 12,179 2 % Segment operating income: Cable Networks $ 1,726 $ 1,791 (4\n)\n%\n$ 2,584 $ 2,655 (3\n)\n%\nBroadcasting 343 344 — % 628 723 (13\n)\n%\nEquity in the income of investees 13 88 (85\n)\n%\n63 207 (70\n)\n%\n$ 2,082 $ 2,223 (6\n)\n%\n$ 3,275 $ 3,585 (9\n)\n%\nCable Networks\nCable Networks revenues for the quarter increased 5% to $4.3 billion and operating income decreased 4% to $1.7 billion. Lower operating income was primarily due to a loss at BAMTech and decreases at Freeform and ESPN.\nIn the current quarter, BAMTech’s operating loss is reported in Cable Networks as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. In the prior-year quarter, the Company’s share of BAMTech results was reported in equity in the income of investees. The loss at BAMTech reflects ongoing investments in their technology platform including costs associated with ESPN+.\nResults at Freeform were primarily due to lower advertising revenue reflecting a decrease in average viewership.\nThe decrease at ESPN was driven by higher programming costs, partially offset by affiliate revenue growth and higher advertising revenue. The programming cost increase was due to a shift in timing of College Football Playoff (CFP) bowl games and contractual rate increases for college sports and NBA programming. The current quarter included two semi-final bowl games and one host bowl game, whereas the prior-year quarter included three host bowl games. Semi-final games generally have a higher cost than host games. Affiliate revenue growth reflected contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in subscribers. Higher advertising revenue was due to an increase in rates, partially offset by lower impressions driven by fewer units delivered and a decrease in average viewership. Rates benefited from the shift of CFP games.\nBroadcasting\nBroadcasting revenues and segment operating income for the quarter were essentially flat at $1.9 billion and $343 million, respectively. Higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases was offset by a decline in advertising revenue, lower income from program sales and higher network programming and marketing costs.\nThe decrease in advertising revenues was due to fewer network impressions, partially offset by higher network rates. The decline in network impressions was due to a decrease in average viewership, partially offset by an increase in units delivered. Lower income from program sales reflected higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder in the prior-year quarter. The increase in network programming costs was due to a higher cost mix of programming, including the impact of more hours of higher cost acquired programming, and contractual increases, partially offset by lower production cost write-downs. Marketing costs increased to support new primetime series and mid-season launches.\nEquity in the Income of Investees\nEquity in the income of investees decreased from $88 million in the prior-year quarter to $13 million in the current quarter due to higher losses from Hulu, partially offset by higher operating results from A +E Television Networks (A+E). The decrease at Hulu was driven by higher programming, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. The increase at A+E was due to lower marketing and programming costs, a gain from an investment and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue.\nParks and Resorts\nParks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 13% to $4.9 billion and segment operating income increased 27% to $1.0 billion. Operating income growth for the quarter was due to increases at our domestic and international parks and resorts. Results included a benefit from a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday relative to our fiscal periods. The current quarter included one week of the Easter holiday, whereas the entire Easter holiday fell in the third quarter of the prior year.\nHigher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, attendance growth at Walt Disney World Resort and higher sponsorship revenue, partially offset by increased costs. Guest spending growth was due to increases in average ticket prices, average daily hotel room rates and food, beverage and merchandise spending. The increase in costs was primarily due to labor and other cost inflation, an increase in depreciation associated with new attractions and higher technology spending.\nThe increase at our international parks and resorts was due to growth at Disneyland Paris and higher occupied room nights and attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. These increases were partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort driven by lower attendance, cost inflation and an unfavorable foreign currency impact. Higher operating income at Disneyland Paris was due to increases in guest spending and attendance, partially offset by cost inflation. Guest spending growth at Disneyland Paris was due to higher average ticket prices driven by less discounting, and increases in average daily hotel room rates and food, beverage and merchandise spending.\nStudio Entertainment\nStudio Entertainment revenues for the quarter increased 21% to $2.5 billion and segment operating income increased 29% to $847 million. Operating income growth was due to increases in theatrical, home entertainment and TV/SVOD distribution results, partially offset by higher film cost impairments.\nThe increase in theatrical distribution results was due to the success of Black Panther in the current quarter with no comparable Marvel title in the prior-year quarter. This increase was partially offset by the performance of A Wrinkle in Time in the current quarter compared to Beauty and the Beast in the prior-year quarter.\nGrowth at home entertainment was driven by higher average net effective pricing and an increase in unit sales, both of which reflected the successful release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Higher unit sales reflected the DVD/Blu-ray release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in the current quarter whereas the DVD/Blu-ray release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story occurred in the prior-year third quarter. Other significant titles included Thor: Ragnarok and Coco in the current quarter compared to Moana and Doctor Strange in the prior-year quarter.\nHigher TV/SVOD distribution results were due to international growth and the domestic free television sale of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the current quarter.\nConsumer Products & Interactive Media\nConsumer Products & Interactive Media revenues increased 2% to $1.1 billion and segment operating income decreased 4% to $354 million as higher income from licensing activities was more than offset by a decrease in comparable retail store sales and an unfavorable foreign currency impact.\nThe increase in income from licensing was due to higher minimum guarantee shortfall recognition and increased sponsorship revenue, partially offset by a decrease in settlements and lower licensing revenue from sales of merchandise and games. Higher minimum guarantee shortfall recognition was due to a favorable timing impact. Shortfalls are generally recognized at the end of the contract period. For contracts that ended on December 31, shortfalls were recognized in the second quarter of the current year whereas they were recognized in the first quarter of the prior year.\nOTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nCorporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses increased $33 million to $194 million in the current quarter due to costs incurred in connection with our agreement to acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and higher compensation costs.\nOther income, net\nOther income for the current quarter reflects insurance proceeds related to a legal matter.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net was as follows (in millions):\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change Interest expense $ (172 ) $ (115 ) (50\n)\n%\nInterest and investment income 29 31 (6\n)\n%\nInterest expense, net $ (143 ) $ (84 ) (70\n)\n%\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances and an increase in average interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate was as follows:\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change Effective income tax rate 20.7 % 32.3 % 11.6 ppt The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the quarter reflected a net favorable impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based awards. The net impact of the Tax Act reflects the following:\nA reduction in the Company’s fiscal 2018 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 24.5% from 35.0% in the prior year. Net of state tax and other related effects, the reduction in the statutory rate had an impact of approximately 10.2 percentage points on the effective income tax rate. A net benefit of approximately $0.1 billion from updating our first quarter estimates of the remeasurement of U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities and a one-time tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings (Deemed Repatriation Tax). This update includes the impact of legislation enacted in the second quarter that accelerated tax deductions into fiscal 2017 at the higher 2017 statutory rate. In the current-year six-month period, the Company recognized a net benefit of $1.7 billion due to a $2.0 billion benefit from the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by an approximately $350 million impact from the Deemed Repatriation Tax.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nQuarter Ended (in millions) March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 178 $ 151 (18\n)\n%\nThe increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to lower tax expense at ESPN, largely due to the Tax Act, and the impact of the Company’s acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Disneyland Paris in the third quarter of the prior year, partially offset by lower operating results at Shanghai Disney Resort.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable.\nCash Flow\nCash provided by operations and free cash flow were as follows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Change Cash provided by operations $ 6,763 $ 4,673 $ 2,090 Investments in parks, resorts and other property (2,044 ) (1,923 ) (121 ) Free cash flow (1) $ 4,719 $ 2,750 $ 1,969 (1) Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the discussion on pages 7 through 9.\nCash provided by operations for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased by $2.1 billion from $4.7 billion in the prior-year quarter to $6.8 billion in the current quarter. The increase was due to lower pension plan contributions, a decrease in income tax payments due to the Tax Act and higher operating results at our Parks and Resorts segment, partially offset by higher film and television production spending.\nCapital Expenditures and Depreciation Expense\nInvestments in parks, resorts and other property were as follows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Media Networks Cable Networks $ 135 $ 60 Broadcasting 45 33 Total Media Networks\n180 93 Parks and Resorts Domestic 1,413 1,093 International 307 579 Total Parks and Resorts 1,720 1,672 Studio Entertainment 52 47 Consumer Products & Interactive Media 10 8 Corporate 82 103 Total investments in parks, resorts and other property $ 2,044 $ 1,923 Capital expenditures increased by $121 million to $2.0 billion due to higher spending on new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts and on technology at BAMTech, partially offset by lower spending at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort.\nDepreciation expense was as follows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Media Networks Cable Networks $ 84 $ 71 Broadcasting 48 46 Total Media Networks 132 117 Parks and Resorts Domestic 713 650 International 357 313 Total Parks and Resorts 1,070 963 Studio Entertainment 26 23 Consumer Products & Interactive Media 27 31 Corporate 109 129 Total depreciation expense $ 1,364 $ 1,263 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release presents EPS excluding the impact of certain items affecting comparability, free cash flow and aggregate segment operating income, all of which are important financial measures for the Company, but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.\nThese measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of EPS, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability, free cash flow and aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nEPS excluding certain items affecting comparability – The Company uses EPS excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items affecting comparability of results from period to period. The Company believes that information about EPS exclusive of these items is useful to investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows for comparability between periods of the operating performance of the Company’s business and allows investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the impact of the operations of the business.\nThe following table reconciles reported EPS to EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability for the quarter.\n(in millions except EPS) Pre-Tax Income/ Loss\nTax Benefit/ Expense (1)\nAfter-Tax Income/ Loss (2)\nEPS (3) Change vs.\nprior year\nperiod\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018: As reported $ 3,928 $ (813 ) $ 3,115 $ 1.95 30 % Exclude: Net benefit from the Tax Act (4) — (134 ) (134 ) (0.09 ) Other income, net (5) (41 ) 11 (30 ) (0.02 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (6) 13 (3 ) 10 0.01 Excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 3,900 $ (939 ) $ 2,961 $ 1.84 23 % Six Months Ended March 31, 2018: As reported $ 7,673 $ (85 ) $ 7,588 $ 4.86 59 % Exclude: Net benefit from the Tax Act (4) — (1,691 ) (1,691 ) (1.10 ) Other income, net (5) (94 ) 23 (71 ) (0.05 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (6) 28 (6 ) 22 0.01 Excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 7,607 $ (1,759 ) $ 5,848 $ 3.73 22 % (1)\nTax benefit/expense adjustments are determined using the tax rate applicable to the individual item affecting comparability. (2) Before noncontrolling interest share. (3) Net of noncontrolling interest share, where applicable. Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding. (4) Amounts reflect the remeasurement of U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by the Deemed Repatriation Tax (see page 5 for more information). (5) Other income for the current quarter reflects insurance proceeds related to a legal matter. Other income for the current six-month period also includes a gain from the sale of property rights. (6) For the current quarter and six-month period, the Company recorded $13 million and $28 million, respectively, of restructuring and impairment charges primarily for severance costs. Free cash flow – The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to service debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nAggregate segment operating income – The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results.\nA reconciliation of income before income taxes to segment operating income is as follows (in millions):\nQuarter Ended % Change Six Months Ended % Change (in millions) March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Better/\n(Worse) March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Better/\n(Worse) Income before income taxes $ 3,928 $ 3,751 5 % $ 7,673 $ 7,476 3 % Add/(subtract): Corporate and unallocated shared expenses 194 161 (20\n)\n%\n344 293 (17\n)\n%\nRestructuring and impairment charges 13 — nm 28 — nm Other income, net (41 ) — nm (94 ) — nm Interest expense, net 143 84 (70\n)\n%\n272 183 (49\n)\n%\nSegment Operating Income $ 4,237 $ 3,996 6 % $ 8,223 $ 7,952 3 % CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nIn conjunction with this release, The Walt Disney Company will host a conference call today, May 8, 2018, at 4:30 PM EDT/1:30 PM PDT via a live Webcast.
