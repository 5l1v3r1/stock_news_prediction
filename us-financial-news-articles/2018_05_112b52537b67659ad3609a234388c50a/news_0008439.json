It also showed that U.S. factory activity slowed for a second straight month in April.\nWhile first-quarter corporate profits are expected to have notched their best growth in seven years, largely due to lower taxes, investors have focused on cost warnings from companies.\n“The red flags are everywhere,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director of Hartland & Co in New York. “We’re finally getting the inflation that to date has been so elusive.”\nThe energy sector fell 1.1 percent on the back of a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as the dollar remained near a four-month high. Still, oil prices remain near their highest levels since 2014.\nShares of Pfizer Inc fell 4.4 percent, the greatest percentage decline on the Dow, after posting its biggest miss on quarterly revenue in a year as demand for its key drugs fell short of estimates.\nTechnology was the biggest gainer among the S&P&rsquo;s major sectors, up 1.0 percent as Apple Inc shares rose 2.1 percent ahead of its quarterly report after the bell.\nShares of Match Group Inc, the owner of dating app Tinder, and IAC/InterActiveCorp, Match’s parent company, dropped after Facebook Inc announced that it would add dating features to its flagship social network. Match shares tumbled 22.9 percent while IAC shares sank 15.9 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 31 new highs and 70 new lows.
