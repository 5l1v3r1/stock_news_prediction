Aurora offered to buy each MedReleaf share for C$29.44, representing an 18.2 percent premium to MedReleaf's Friday closing price.\nBMO Capital Markets was Aurora's financial adviser, while Canaccord Genuity advised MedReleaf.\nSeparately on Monday, Aurora's chief rival Canopy Growth said it would buy out a stake in a British Columbia joint venture and also announced a plan to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:28:55.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
