(Reuters) - Rickie Fowler found himself up a tree and out of the Players Championship after his second round on Friday. May 11, 2018; Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, USA; Rickie Fowler plays from a bunker on the fifth hole during the second round of The Players Championship golf tournament at TPC Sawgrass - Adam Hagy-USA TODAY Sports\nFowler’s early exit from the event came after a wayward tee shot at the par-four sixth hole that appeared to strike a palm tree and remain nestled in one of the fronds at TPC Sawgrass.\nThe ball was clearly visible, but though spectators vowed it was Fowler’s, he could not identify it with 100 percent certainly, even with binoculars.\nAfter a discussion with rules official Mark Russell, Fowler declared a lost ball and had no choice but to return to the tee for his third shot.\nHe double-bogeyed the hole and, perhaps shaken by the incident, also dropped two shots at the next on his way to a 71 for one-over 145, destined to miss the cut by a couple of shots.

I couldn’t see any of my markings and so couldn’t identify it, so back to the tee.”\nFowler, the 2015 champion, lamented that under the rules of golf a ball does not have to be identified if it apparently goes into a hazard, a marked area of the course that contains a difficult obstacle.
