This is non-negotiable.\n“We agree that football suffers from sporting and economic imbalance and our members are the victims of that as their jobs outside the elite are deteriorating.\n“The cause of this problem however is the inequitable distribution of money in our sport. FIFPro finds it unacceptable to tackle such concerns by limiting the fundamental rights of players as EU citizens.”\nCeferin, who has made addressing the inequalities in the European game a central issue, argued that if players, or young children, from small clubs or small countries leave very early it harms the competitive balance.\nEuropean club football has become increasingly dominated by a handful of elite clubs, who cherry-pick the best players and enjoy the luxury of having world class footballers on the substitutes bench.\nThe Champions League has been punctuated by some embarrassingly one-sided contests while many domestic leagues have turned into one-horse races.\nJuventus have won the last seven Serie A titles while Bayern Munich have won six in a row in Germany. Celtic have won the last seven Scottish league titles and Dinamo Zagreb have won 12 of the last 13 titles in Croatia.
