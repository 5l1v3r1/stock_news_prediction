They encounter each other in the first episode but don’t realize it until later. Photo: BBC AMERICA/Sid Gentle Films Ltd “Killing Eve” is proving the television thriller can still surprise.\nIn the BBC America series, Sandra Oh is Eve, an intelligence agent bored with her job until she becomes fixated on Villanelle, an assassin (played by Jodie Comer ) with a penchant for flamboyant killings. It becomes a two-way obsession when Villanelle starts stalking Eve.\nIts sixth episode, the latest one for which complete viewing data were available, drew 941,000 total viewers, including those who watched it within three days of its airing. Over the same period, 3.6 million viewers watched the night’s most popular cable series, AMC’s “Fear the Walking Dead.” But “Killing Eve” is a rare example of a serial TV show whose audience has steadily grown after its debut.\nA clip from BBC America’s ‘Killing Eve.’ From its April premiere through its first six episodes, ratings increased every week. Overall, they rose 77% among 25- to 54-year-old viewers. BBC America says it is the only new ad-supported scripted series to show such consistent growth in more than a decade.\n“Killing Eve” is also in demand overseas. Endeavor Content, which helped finance the project, says it has sold rights to the show in more than 100 countries, with buyers that include French network Canal+, HBO Europe and the BBC. BBC America is a joint venture between BBC Studios, the BBC’s commercial arm, and AMC Networks in the U.S.\nLeading up to its May 27 finale, the eight-episode first season has turned fans into evangelists by tweaking the conventions of TV crime dramas.\nEpisodes mix international intrigue and bursts of violence with lovers’ quarrels. Jokes shatter tense moments. The story and performances have gotten viewers rooting for both Eve and Villanelle, a psychopath who executes targets with a poison-filled hairpin and toxic perfume.\nEve (Ms. Oh) attempts to defend herself when Villanelle (Ms. Comer) breaks into her home. Photo: BBC AMERICA/Sid Gentle Films Ltd “If you can flip something, it can feel truthful even if it is a bit warped,” says “Killing Eve” lead writer and executive producer Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\nFor example: the fifth episode, when Villanelle breaks into Eve’s home not to kill her but, to Eve’s disbelief, to chat over dinner.\n“When the cat and the mouse meet, it’s usually at the end of the series, and someone is tied to a chair, guns are out and something explodes,” Ms. Waller-Bridge says. In her version, the standoff happens midseason and builds intensity with Eve first attempting to defend herself with a toilet brush, then—after Villanelle convinces her that she isn’t there to kill her—microwaving leftovers for dinner.\n“I wanted to make that the most domestic, intimate, bizarrely relatable moment,” adds Ms. Waller-Bridge. “It’s just two women together in a kitchen, having shepherd’s pie together.”\nTrending\nCrowdfunding Boosts ‘Super Troopers 2’ (May 16) How Donald Glover’s ‘Atlanta’ Breaks TV’s Rules (May 9) How ‘Paddington 2’ Became an Unexpected Hit Sequel (Jan. 31) By Accident, ‘Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ Strikes a #MeToo Chord (Jan. 20) BBC America sought out Ms. Waller-Bridge based on “Fleabag,” an Amazon/BBC dark comedy she created and starred in about a woman spinning out of control in the wake of setbacks including her best friend’s suicide and her cafe going out of business. With U.K. producer Sid Gentle Films, the network developed “Killing Eve,” which Ms. Waller-Bridge adapted from books by Luke Jennings.\nBBC America ordered a second season of “Killing Eve” before the first episode aired. That early renewal was in part a message to potential viewers: “It’s worth investing your time,” says Sarah Barnett, the network’s president and general manager. “Part of that is knowing the show will endure.”\nFor her network, a smaller fish in the cable TV sea, “finding something with such compelling storytelling bones is part of what we need to really matter,” Ms. Barnett says.\n“Killing Eve” also factors in the network’s interest in female-focused dramas. “Orphan Black,” a thriller about a woman and her multiple clones (all played by Emmy winner Tatiana Maslany ), wrapped in 2017 after five seasons. Next fall the 55-year-old sci-fi franchise “Doctor Who” returns with Jodie Whittaker as the first woman in the title role.\n‘I wanted people to be scared of her but kind of want to be her friend,’ Ms. Comer says of her murderous character Villanelle, who confronts Eve (Ms. Oh). Photo: BBC AMERICA/Sid Gentle Films Ltd “Killing Eve” has dual leads in Ms. Oh and Ms. Comer, whose characters have opposing powers, Ms. Waller-Bridge says. “Villanelle is an arch manipulator. She gets a kick out of being able to convince people that she is any number of characters. Eve is a truth seeker—she can cut through all that shit.”\nAs Villanelle, Ms. Comer stares into the eyes of her dying targets, yet also takes impish joy in taunting her Russian handler Konstantin ( Kim Bodnia ). It was challenging to get inside a character “so flippant about things that are quite awful to the average person,” Ms. Comer says.\n“I wanted people to be scared of her but kind of want to be her friend, deep down. She’s a villain that you like,” says Ms. Comer, who previously starred in Starz’s “The White Princess.”\nMs. Oh, best known for her long-running role on the ABC medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” says establishing the “Killing Eve” tone sometimes required her to go against her instincts. For instance, during an argument between Eve and her husband ( Owen McDonnell ), Ms. Waller-Bridge suggested Ms. Oh play the moment as “satisfied” instead of angry.\n“I had read it as a classic drama scene—husband and wife arguing—but we weren’t playing it as it was written on the page, in all caps and exclamation marks,” she says. “It’s tricky, but I think that keeps the audience slightly off balance.”\nThe guessing game extends to the potential double meaning of the name of the show, Ms. Oh says. “Most people, including myself, thought that meant the poor lady is going to be killed. But does the killing happen to Eve, or is Eve doing the killing?”\nWhy It’s Working\nThe Show : “Killing Eve” The Plot : An agent for British intelligence tracks an international assassin, and vice versa. The Reaction : Ratings grew every week from its April premiere through its first six episodes, a rare trend in TV. The Formula : Series creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who grew up a fan of the wit in old James Bond films, tried to rethink conventions of the thriller genre. “With a little tweak or shift of perspective they can become more personal and more real,” she says.
