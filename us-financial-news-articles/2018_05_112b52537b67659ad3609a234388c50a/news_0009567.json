This market clearance allows commercialization of MagnetOs Putty in Europe, and complements the existing clearance for MagnetOs Granules, and the 510K clearance for both formulations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an autograft extender in the posterolateral spine. With its unique submicron surface topography, MagnetOs preferentially directs early wound healing toward the bone-forming pathway. Numerous studies have shown that MagnetOs leads to progressive bone formation and implant resorption comparable to autograft (patient’s own bone), the current gold standard.\nJoost de Bruijn, Chief Executive Officer of Kuros, said: “MagnetOs Putty and MagnetOs Granules have now been cleared in our main target markets. We are gearing up for the commercial roll-out later this year in the U.S. and selected geographies in Europe, as we are executing on our strategy to build a leading orthobiologics company.”\nMagnetOs promotes local bone formation equivalent to current gold standard, autograft. MagnetOs is a bone graft substitute intended to fill bony voids or gaps of the human skeletal system and promote the formation of bone at the implanted site. A substantial number of clinically relevant and predictive studies have demonstrated its equivalence to the current gold standard (patient’s own bone, which may not be available in sufficient quantities and/or involves morbidity, costs and pain associated with its harvesting from another healthy site of the patient’s body). MagnetOs is a bone graft comprising biphasic calcium phosphate with an advanced submicron surface topography that directs bone formation after implantation. With its unique submicron surface topography, MagnetOs preferentially directs early wound healing toward the bone-forming pathway, resulting in an osteoinductive claim in Europe. MagnetOs is available as granules and as a putty formulation.\nFor further information, please contact:\nKuros Biosciences AG\nMichael Grau\nChief Financial Officer\nTel +41 44 733 47 47\nmichael.grau@kurosbio.com\nMedia & Investors\nHans Herklots\nLifeSci Advisors\n+41 79 598 7149\nhherklots@lifesciadvisors.com\nAbout Kuros Biosciences AG\nKuros Biosciences (SIX:KURN) is focused on the development of innovative products for bone regeneration and is located in Schlieren (Zurich), Switzerland and Bilthoven, The Netherlands.
