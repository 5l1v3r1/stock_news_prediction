Taxi drivers block the road in Whitehall in central London June 11, 2014. Taxi drivers sowed traffic chaos in Europe's top cities on Wednesday by mounting one of the biggest ever protests against Uber, a U.S. car service which allows people to summon rides at the touch of a button. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nKhan has already introduced an additional charge on the most gas-guzzling vehicles entering central London and has brought forward the introduction of an ultra-low emission zone.\n“The Mayor already supports a number of car-restricted days for annual events in London, and he has asked City Hall officials to consider additional opportunities for car-free activities as part of his Healthy Streets vision,” his office said.\n“The Mayor is determined to do everything in his power to protect the health of Londoners and prioritise walking, cycling and public transport and reduce Londoners’ dependency on polluting cars.”\nCities and nations around the world are planning to restrict or ban the use of diesel and petrol vehicles in the years ahead and promote greener technologies in a bid to improve air quality.
