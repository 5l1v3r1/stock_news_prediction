Head coach Darren Lehmann, who was cleared of wrongdoing, resigned and was replaced last week by Justin Langer.\nThe damage to Australia’s reputation was far-reaching, with local fans disgusted and a major sponsor abruptly ending its support of the team.\nCricket Australia has launched reviews into the players’ behaviour and its own operations, and Lyon said he hoped the England tour could be a fresh start.\n“It’s a good chance for Australian cricket to move on and a good chance for Australian players to rebuild the trust and faith of the Australian public and earn back their respect,” added Lyon, echoing comments from Langer’s first media conference as coach last week.\nLyon has been picked to test England’s left-handed batsmen on their home pitches in a warmup for next year’s World Cup in the same country.\n“It’s well documented that I want to play in all three formats for Australia, that’s my goal,” said Lyon, who has played most of his international cricket in tests.\n“To get this opportunity and be included in the squad and to head over to England, where the World Cup is is being played that’s going to be a massive advantage.” Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T12:32:10.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
