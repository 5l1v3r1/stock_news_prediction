(NYSE: TWI), a leading global manufacturer of off-highway wheels, tires, assemblies, and undercarriage products, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $425.4 million, representing an increase of 19 percent when compared to net sales of $357.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income applicable to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $14.0 million, as compared to a loss of $10.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nPaul Reitz, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"A year ago, when we announced our first quarter results, we were cautiously optimistic by the early signs of growth and our first quarter of net sales growth in more than four years. A year later, as we release our first quarter 2018 results, we are further encouraged by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in net sales. Along with this 19 percent top line growth in this most recently completed quarter, we experienced meaningful improvement in gross profit, gross margin and operating income, which marks the return to a positive bottom line for Titan. Once again, we experienced broad net sales growth across all of our segments, with our earthmoving/construction segment leading the way with 39 percent year-over-year improvement. Excluding currency impacts, net sales from a geographic perspective increased year-over-year in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Australia.\n\"While we're excited about our start to 2018, and we certainly remain optimistic about the remainder of 2018, we are also mindful of the changing, and at times volatile, world around us. The impact on the remainder of the year from potential tariffs and the related effects on steel and commodity prices will be watched closely and is a potential area of concern. Rising interest rates and sluggish commodity prices also threaten farmer demand for new equipment through the remainder of this year and beyond. These uncertainties create the potential for farmers to further delay upgrading their equipment. Sales levels for larger tractors over 100 hp and combines remain well below longer-term, historical averages. The return in demand for these larger products is important for a more robust recovery in our agricultural segment.\n\"During March, we concluded our inaugural Titan University educational program for our North American dealers. Through both classroom sessions and hands-on training, we brought our state-of-the-art facility in Boone, Iowa, to life through interactive sessions delivered by Titan's engineers and field technicians that covered all of our product lines offered in North America. We expect to continue the Titan University program in the future as part of our ongoing focus on customer experience, loyalty and retention. The feedback from our customers has been tremendous, which we believe should have a positive impact on our business as we believe that better informed customers should drive additional demand for Titan's products.\n\"The broad-based growth across our segments and many of our regions over the past five quarters, the impact of rising oil prices, improving farm used equipment inventory levels, and stronger demand in the construction sector, all point toward good things for Titan in 2018. Our strong first-quarter results are a testament to our entire One Titan team and our efforts over the past few years. We believe in the long-term fundamentals and prospects that support our business and our One Titan team will remain steadfast in our focus on the key drivers that will improve Titan moving forward.\"\nSummary of Operations\nNet sales for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $425.4 million, an increase of 19 percent from $357.5 million in the comparable prior year period, primarily as a result of an increase in net sales in the earthmoving/construction segment. Overall net sales volume was up 12 percent over the comparable prior year quarter with higher volume across all segments. Favorable changes in price/mix increased net sales by four percent and favorable currency translations contributed another three percent increase to net sales.\nGross profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $59.6 million compared to $40.2 million in the comparable prior year period. Gross margin was 14 percent of net sales for the latest quarter, compared to 11 percent of net sales in the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross profit was driven by increased sales volume and associated manufacturing efficiencies relating to capacity utilization as well as ongoing continuous improvement initiatives focused on lowering costs and increasing efficiencies.\nSG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $35.9 million, compared to $41.3 million for the comparable prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 8 percent, compared to 12 percent for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in SG&A resulted from lower legal and non-recurring professional fees as compared to the first quarter of 2017, as well as management's continuing efforts to reduce SG&A expenses.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, research and development (R&D) expenses were $2.9 million, or 0.7 percent of net sales, and royalty expense was $2.7 million, or 0.6 percent of net sales, both of which remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior year period.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $18.1 million, or 4 percent of net sales, compared to a loss of $6.6 million, or 2 percent of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017, an improvement of 375 percent.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, interest expense was $7.5 million compared to $7.7 million in the comparable prior year period. Foreign exchange loss was $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a gain of $4.5 million in the comparable period in 2017. Other income was $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.7 million in the same quarter of 2017.\nAn income tax benefit of $(0.8) million was recorded for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a $3.4 million expense in the comparable prior year period. As a result, 2018 first quarter net income applicable to common shareholders was $14.0 million, equal to $0.23 per basic and diluted share, compared to a loss of $10.5 million, equal to $(0.18) per basic and diluted share, in the comparable prior year period.\nEBITDA was $36.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $15.0 million in the comparable prior year period, a 144 percent increase. Adjusted EBITDA was $41.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $10.6 million in the comparable prior year period, a 290 percent increase. The company utilizes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP measures, as a means to measure its operating performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can be found at the end of this release.\nFinancial Condition\nNet cash used for operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $35.7 million, compared to $14.5 million for the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures were $7.8 million for the first three months of 2018 compared to $8.4 million for the comparable prior year period.\nPrincipal and dividend payments of $6.0 million were paid during the first three months of 2018. The company ended the first quarter of 2018 with total cash and cash equivalents of $112.4 million. Long-term debt at March 31, 2018, was $407.6 million, compared to $407.2 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term debt was $55.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $43.7 million at December 31, 2017. Net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) was $350.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $307.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nTeleconference and Webcast\nTitan will be hosting a teleconference and webcast to discuss the first quarter financial results on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.\nThe real-time, listen-only webcast can be accessed on our website at www.titan-intl.com within the \"Investor Relations\" page under the \"News & Events\" menu ( https://ir.titan-intl.com/news-and-events/events/default.aspx ).

thousands, except earnings per share data\nThe company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). This supplemental schedule provides a quantitative reconciliation between net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as we believe that they assist investors with analyzing our business results. In addition, management reviews each of these non-GAAP financial measures in order to evaluate the financial performance of each of our segments, as well as the company's performance as a whole. We believe that the presentation of these non‑GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as management.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. One should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. These measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our businesses as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures may be calculated differently than non-GAAP financial measures reported by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We attempt to compensate for these limitations by analyzing results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, prominently disclosing GAAP results and providing reconciliations from GAAP results to non-GAAP results.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n14,686\n$\n(10,585)\nAdjustments:\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n(786)\n3,442\nInterest expense\n7,518\n7,721\nDepreciation and amortization\n15,330\n14,466\nEBITDA\n$\n36,748\n$\n15,044\nAdjustments:\nForeign exchange loss (gain)\n4,432\n(4,490)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n41,180\n$\n10,554\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/titan-international-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-net-sales-up-19-percent-yoy-and-earnings-of-0-23-per-share-300642524.html\nSOURCE Titan International, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://ir.titan-intl.com/news-and-events/events/default.aspx", "http://www.titan-intl.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/titan-international-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-net-sales-up-19-percent-yoy-and-earnings-of-0-23-per-share-300642524.html"], "published": "2018-05-04T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:29:07.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
