Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn October, Wilmington Trust, now owned by M&T Bank Corp, reached a $60 million deal resolving related charges, a sum that included $16 million it paid in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement in 2014.\nFounded by the du Pont family in 1903, Wilmington Trust received $330 million of federal bailout money in 2008 under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which was meant to bolster U.S. lenders following the real estate market crash.\nTwo years later, Wilmington Trust raised $273.9 million in a February 2010 sale with the intention of repaying the TARP funds.\nAt the time, it reported to regulators just $10.8 million in commercial loans that were 90 days past due, but prosecutors said the real figure was $344 million, and continued to grow. Prosecutors accused the defendants of hiding the bank’s deteriorating finances.\nMounting losses from construction loans and commercial mortgages led to Wilmington’s November 2010 agreement to sell itself to Buffalo, New York-based M&T Bank at a 46 percent discount to its market value.\nThe case is U.S. v. Wilmington Trust Corporation, et al, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 15-cr-00023.
