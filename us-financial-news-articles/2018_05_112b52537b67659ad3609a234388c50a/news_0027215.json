Blue Bird Corporation delivered higher revenue, up 4% from prior year, positive net income of $1.8 million and solid Adjusted EBITDA of $10.0 million. Positive earnings were delivered despite higher commodity costs.\nHighlights\nThree Months Ended B/(W) Six Months Ended B/(W) (in millions except EPS data)\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 March 31, 2018 2017 Unit Sales 2,441 74 4,146 286 GAAP Measures: Revenue $ 216.6 $ 8.0 $ 379.2 $ 33.9 Net Income $ 1.8 $ (0.9 ) $ (6.0 ) $ (0.2 ) Diluted Earnings per Share $ 0.04 $ (0.03 ) $ (0.32 ) $ 0.02 Non-GAAP Measures 1 : Adjusted EBITDA $ 10.0 $ 1.6 $ 15.3 $ 4.3 Adjusted Net Income $ 4.6 $ 1.4 $ 2.9 $ 1.8 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\n$ 0.15 $ 0.06 $ 0.06 $ 0.10 1 Reconciliation to relevant GAAP metrics shown below\n“We are pleased with our second quarter performance and are well positioned to deliver our full-year targets,\" said Phil Horlock, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blue Bird Corporation. “We are excited about the Operational Transformation Initiatives we are implementing to improve quality, reduce cost, increase capacity and ensure that Blue Bird continues its tradition as the innovator in the School Bus industry. These key initiatives will drive higher profitability and margins and we are pleased with progress toward our target of an Adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 10% by FY2020. Continuing to invest in differentiated products that customers want and value is a core priority in Blue Bird, as evidenced by another quarter of strong growth and leadership in sales of our alternative-fuel powered school buses and by customer reaction to our all-new range of electric-powered buses. Blue Bird will begin delivery of electric buses to school districts before the end of this fiscal year.\n\"Despite investment in our initiatives in the second quarter, we continue to generate positive cash flow, with positive net cash provided by operating activities of $0.8 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $3.3 million for the quarter. With our peak sales months ahead, we are maintaining our full year guidance of $40 - $45 million for Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the fiscal year.\n\"Also, despite the substantial jump in commodity prices (especially steel), we are pleased to announce that we are able to re-affirm our full year guidance for both net revenue of $1,010 million - $1,040 million and Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $80 - $85 million.\"\nSecond Quarter 2018 Results\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $216.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of $8.0 million, or 3.8%, from prior year period. Bus unit sales were 2,441 units for the quarter compared with 2,367 units for the same period last year.\nGross Profit\nSecond quarter gross profit of $21.7 million represents a decrease of $3.0 million from the second quarter of last year.\nNet Income\nNet income was $1.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of $0.9 million compared with the same period last year.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income was $4.6 million, representing an increase of $1.4 million compared with the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $10.0 million, or 4.6% of net sales, representing an increase of $1.6 million compared with the second quarter of the prior year.\nYear-to-Date 2018 Results\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $379.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $33.9 million, or 9.8%, compared with the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher bus unit sales, which were 286 units above the same period last year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $42.3 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from the prior year.\nNet Income\nNet income was $6.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, which was $0.2 million below the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $7.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, which was partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in gross profit.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income was $2.9 million, representing an increase of $1.8 million compared with the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $15.3 million, or 4.0% of net sales, for the six months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $4.3 million from the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily the of lower adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses.\nConference Call Details\nBlue Bird will discuss its second quarter 2018 results and other related matters in a conference call at 4:30 PM ET today.

Service and after-market parts are distributed from Blue Bird’s parts distribution center located in Delaware, Ohio.\nKey Non-GAAP Financial Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance\nThis press release includes the following non-GAAP financial measures “Adjusted EBITDA,” \"Adjusted EBITDA Margin,\" \"Adjusted Net Income (Loss),\" \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,\" “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” because management views these metrics as a useful way to look at the performance of our operations between periods and to exclude decisions on capital investment and financing that might otherwise impact the review of profitability of the business based on present market conditions.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income prior to discontinued operations income or loss, interest income, interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization, and disposals, as adjusted to add back certain charges that we may record each year, such as stock-compensation expense and transaction costs, as these expenses are not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is net income as adjusted to add back certain transaction costs not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (as if we had GAAP net income during the respective period). Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share are not measures of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. The measures are used as a supplement to GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business, as described below.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because the measures consider the performance of our operations, excluding decisions made with respect to capital investment, financing, and other expenses. We believe that the non-GAAP metrics offer additional financial metrics that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliation to GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share should not be considered as alternatives to net income or GAAP earnings per share as an indicator of our performance or as alternatives to any other measure prescribed by GAAP as there are limitations to using such non-GAAP measures. Although we believe the non-GAAP measures may enhance the evaluation of our operating performance based on recent revenue generation and product/overhead cost control because they exclude the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, and other expenses, (i) other companies in Blue Bird’s industry may define Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share differently than we do and, as a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in Blue Bird’s industry, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing disclosure of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share and GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation to GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our operating results.\nOur measures of “Free Cash Flow” and \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by/used in operations minus cash paid for fixed assets. We define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow minus cash paid for special compensation and other business combination expenses. We use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, and ratios based on both, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets and intangible assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed or intangible assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed or intangible assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements relate to expectations for future financial performance, business strategies or expectations for our business. Specifically, forward-looking statements include statements in this press release regarding guidance, seasonality, product mix and gross profits and may include statements relating to:\nInherent limitations of internal controls impacting financial statements Growth opportunities Future profitability Ability to expand market share Customer demand for certain products Economic conditions that could affect fuel costs, commodity costs, industry size and financial conditions of our dealers and suppliers Labor or other constraints on the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure Volatility in the tax base and other funding sources that support the purchase of buses by our end customers Lower or higher than anticipated market acceptance for our products Other statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or similar expressions\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this press release, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. The factors described above, as well as risk factors described in reports filed with the SEC by us (available at www.sec.gov ), could cause our actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements.\nBLUE BIRD CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited) (in thousands except for share data) March 31, 2018 September
