So, one way or another, we are going to deal with this recurring problem of trade with China,” Ross told CNBC.\nRoss did not provide details on the Trump administration’s specific demands on China but said, “We have a pretty good idea of what we need to come out with.”\nTrump administration officials have called for a $100 billion reduction in the United States’ $375 billion trade deficit with China, a reduction in China’s car tariffs, and more U.S. access to the Asian nation’s vast markets.\n“If they gave in on most of the things that we wanted, for sure there are some things that perhaps are not totally satisfactory, so this is going to come back to the president,” Ross said. “This won’t be, suddenly in Beijing, a breathtaking release (that) everything is solved.”\nReporting by Makini Brice and David Lawder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:38:06.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
