Musk\nStarting at $78,000, the AWD performance Model 3 would make it pricier than BMW's high performance M3 that's priced over $67,000 and marketed as the \"ultimate driving machine.\" Musk, however, boasted the Model 3 would be faster and easier to handle. The AWD performance Model 3 \"will beat anything in its class on the track,\" the billionaire added.\nA normal dual-motor will be less costly, Musk said, but will do 0-60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds and has a top speed of 140 miles per hour. Musk tweet\nMusk's tease comes as a recent report suggested the Model 3 could take a production leap in spite of its well-publicized woes. Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3, which is expected to catapult Tesla into the ranks of mainstream auto producers, instead of a niche purveyor of high-end roadsters.\nElectric car blog Electrek , citing a leaked email from Musk to employees, said it was \"quite likely\" Tesla will make more than 500 Model 3 cars per day this week.\nIf that prediction holds true, then Tesla could conceivably hit a weekly production rate of 3,500 cars per week. The company is trying to reach a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the quarter, but has had to push back that timetable.\nMusk and his ambitions have come under withering scrutiny, heightened recently by a controversial earnings call in which the billionaire was openly dismissive of analysts' questions.\nLast month, Musk boasted that Tesla would be cash-positive in the second half of this year. However, a number of prominent Wall Street analysts have warned the company is facing a cash crunch, and may need to tap the market sooner rather than later. Goldman Sachs estimates Tesla may require as much as $10 billion in additional capital by 2020.\nTesla' stock, which shed nearly 3 percent in Friday's trading session, is down more than to 11 percent year to date.\n--CNBC's Robert Ferris contributed to this story.
