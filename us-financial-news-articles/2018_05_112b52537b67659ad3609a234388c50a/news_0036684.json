The opposition has also released an audio recording purporting to show Xhafaj’s brother knew about drug deals in his home town.\n“We won’t stop until Xhafaj quits, and Rama quits,” said Edi Paloka, the Democrat’s deputy chairman. “This has just started.”\nRama said a technical analysis had shown the video was fake and it was enough for him to back Xhafaj. “If it is proved, those who staged this hideous game to ... smear Albania in the eyes of the world, should pay,” Rama said.\nReporting by Benet Koleka, Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:24:03.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
