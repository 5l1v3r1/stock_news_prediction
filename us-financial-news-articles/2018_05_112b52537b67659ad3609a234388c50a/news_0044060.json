REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo\nIn 2012, Minsk recalled its envoy to Sweden and expelled Sweden’s ambassador after the toy bears were dropped over Belarussian territory, each carrying a message urging the authoritarian country to show greater respect for human rights.\nSince then, President Alexander Lukashenko has heeded some calls from the West to show more leniency towards political opposition, seeking to improve ties with the European Union and lessen Belarus’s dependence on neighbouring Russia.\n“We have an unjustifiably low level of relations with Scandinavian countries,” Lukashenko’s press service quoted him as saying as he appointed new ambassador Dmitry Mironchik.
