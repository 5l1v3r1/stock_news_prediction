The TPS was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in El Salvador that left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.\nThe decision to end TPS for Salvadorans was part of the administration’s broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the United States illegally.\nThe IOM data also showed that deportations of Hondurans and Guatemalans from the United States and Mexico had grown over the same period, up 29 percent and 48 percent, respectively.\nReporting by Nelson Renteria, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:38:00.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
