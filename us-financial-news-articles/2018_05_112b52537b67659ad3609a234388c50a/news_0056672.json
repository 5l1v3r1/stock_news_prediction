(\"IBTX\") (NASDAQ: IBTX). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, GBNK shareholders will receive 0.45 of a IBTX share in exchange for each GBNK share they own, representing consideration of $ 32.73 per GBNK share, based on IBTX's May 23 trading price of $72.75.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether GBNK's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, according to IBTX's Chairman and CEO, \"[t]his transaction represents the build out of [IBTX's] Colorado footprint through the acquisition of a high quality bank operating in dynamic markets along the Front Range. [GBNK] is the premier Colorado banking franchise and brings a committed management team, consistent level of high profitability, clean balance sheet, strong core deposit base, and a track record of growth.\"\nMoreover, the Company recently announced record earnings. It reported net income of $13.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an impressive 37.7% annual increase when compared to the figures reported in the same period of the previous year.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether GBNK's Board acted in the best interests of GBNK's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.
