Soccer Football - England Training - St. George’s Park, Burton Upon Trent, Britain - May 22, 2018 General view during training Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nYears of underachievement and disappointment have doused any serious hope among supporters and jingoistic media that England will finally emulate the feats of 1966 and win the World Cup.\nStatistically, they remain one of the major teams most likely to qualify effortlessly for tournaments but least likely to win one. Unbeaten in qualifiers for major tournaments since 2009, they have won only six knockout games of international football since that day when Bobby Moore lifted the Jules Rimet trophy at Wembley Stadium.\nIt is now 12 years since they beat Ecuador to reach the World Cup quarter-finals where they lost to Portugal on penalties, a familiar English fate over the years.\nTheir last two major tournaments have been disastrous, with exit in the group stages in Brazil in 2014 followed by ignominious defeat to Iceland at Euro 2016, a result that pitched the team to an historic low and predictably cost manager Roy Hodgson his job.\nIn fact, there was more ignominy to come with the bizarre 67-day stewardship of Sam Allardyce, who departed after a newspaper sting, before current manager Gareth Southgate was promoted from the Under-21 team.\nSouthgate, who was an accomplished defender, is one of the few England players of recent vintage to have known relative success at an international tournament having been in the side who reached the semi-finals of Euro 96.
