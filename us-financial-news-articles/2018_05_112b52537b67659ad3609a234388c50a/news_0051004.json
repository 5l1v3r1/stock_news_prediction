The introduction of General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) comes at a time when Facebook is receiving widespread criticism for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and for allowing fake news to flourish on its platform.\n\"I get the feeling that Facebook is taking all those issues connected with the privacy of our people very seriously,\" Andrus Ansip, the European Commission's vice president for digital issues, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche Thursday.\nEurope and Facebook must 'work together' Earlier in the week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before European lawmakers to apologize for the social media giant's role in a massive data leak.

They are dealing with fake accounts and they are trying to figure out who is behind some kind of information campaignsâ€¦ (But) we have to work together.\"\nFacebook recently transferred around 1.5 billion of its international users from the jurisdiction of its European headquarters, in Ireland, to its U.S. headquarters instead. That move triggered some external observers to criticize the social media company for allegedly trying to evade the prospect of costly repercussions from any breaches of GDPR.\nThe changes to data laws are expected to have a far-reaching impact on some of the biggest technology firms in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:15:06.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
