The soldiers have denied wrongdoing and say they fear for their lives.\nGreek courts have dismissed the Turkish demands, saying there were not convinced the eight would face a fair trial in their country.\nTurkish EU Minister Omer Celik called the Council of State ruling “the most embarrassing decision a country can make”.\n“The justice system of Greece, an EU member, decided to defend the terrorists who attempted a coup to overthrow democracy in Turkey,” he said on Twitter.\nThe soldiers - three majors, three captains and two sergeant majors - flew to Greece by helicopter on July 16, 2016, as the coup attempt against Erdogan crumbled.\nThe Greek government had appealed against the asylum board verdict on one of the soldiers, winning a temporary injunction suspending his asylum status “for reasons of public interest” until a formal court hearing.\nThe other soldiers’ asylum cases are still pending.\nOnce the Council of State ruling is officially registered, the Turkish soldier will be freed, the judicial source said.
