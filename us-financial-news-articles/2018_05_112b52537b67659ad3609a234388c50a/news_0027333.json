We must stop sweeping it under the carpet under the guise of confidentiality and expose it for what it is,” Paul Tergat, President of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK), said.\n“I once again wish to repeat my previous call that this menace must be treated for what it is - a criminal act and all participants in the whole chain face the severest sanctions possible - whoever they may be - as provided in Law,” added Tergat, who was twice Olympic 10,000 meters silver medalist.\n“As a former athlete, President of NOCK and IOC Member, I am most disturbed by these recent developments. It is telling me that whatever we have been doing is not delivering results and there is need to recalibrate our approach,” Tergat said in an address to athletes at a ceremony for Kenyan medalists from the recent Commonwealth Games in Australia.\nFormer Olympic 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop has tested positive for the banned blood booster EPO, the IAAF’s Athletics Integrity Unit confirmed on Friday.\nThe 28-year-old three-times world champion was the latest among the over 50 Kenyan athletes who have failed doping tests, including 2016 Olympic marathon gold medalist Jemima Sumgong.\nKiprop has vowed to prove his innocence and his case is now with an IAAF tribunal.\nReporting by Isaack Omolu, Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T00:11:22.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
