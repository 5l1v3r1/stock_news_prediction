Is it a font of innovation? Unclear, trending to probably not,\" the Social Capital founder and CEO told \"Squawk Box.\"\nHe said he can see why Warren Buffett pushed Berkshire Hathaway to add in the first quarter to its already massive Apple stake. \"They are famous buyers of value.

I'd love to own 100 percent of it.\"\nLast week, Buffett revealed to CNBC that Berkshire bought 75 million shares of Apple in the three months of the year, adding to the 165.3 million shares Berkshire already owned at the end of 2017. As of Tuesday's close, Berkshire's Apple stake is worth about $44.6 billion.
