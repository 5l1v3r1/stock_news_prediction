(\"Metanor\" or the “Company”) (TSX-V:MTO) reports its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This press release should be read in conjunction with Metanor’s financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and the related Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), which can be found on the Company’s website www.metanor.ca and on SEDAR www.sedar.com . All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless stated otherwise.\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE QUARTER\nMetanor is following through with the corporate refocusing aimed at simultaneously increasing production and exploration programs while leveraging and enhancing our existing infrastructures as Metanor has the only permitted and operating facility in the extremely prospective Urban Barry camp. The Company continues to develop new mining areas to increase mining tonnages in the short term.\nIn conjunction with Metanor’s robust exploration programs (29,940 metres drilled during the quarter), we are moving along with the public consultations, as part of the permitting process, to increase the daily capacity of the mill from 800 tonnes per day to 2,400 tonnes per day. This increased capacity at Bachelor would allow feed from the Barry project, the Bachelor mine and Moroy sector. Management expects that the Moroy Sector could generate enough ore in the short term to increase the tonnes milled per day to 800 tonnes from the current milling rate of approximately 500 tonnes per day which would have a significant positive impact.\nThe Company began the construction of a new camp at the Barry project in the quarter, which was completed in May, to accommodate the additional workers required to proceed with the 50,000 underground bulk sample scheduled to be completed by the Q4 in 2018.\nEXPLORATION HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE QUARTER\n• The Moroy Zone adds new dimension to the Bachelor Mine as development from the new drill bay at level 11, towards the Moroy Zone (1 km south of the Bachelor Mine), continued. A second diamond drill was commissioned to define the Moroy structures from underground and 7,409 metres were drilled in the quarter:\nThe Moroy Vein System was extended by over 100 metres to depth from underground exploration drilling, which included significant intercepts such as 7 g/t Au over 3.9 metres and 7.4 g/t Au over 2.7 metres; and the ongoing underground development at level 11 of the Bachelor mine reached the two known Moroy Veins, while returning significant intercepts such as 50.9 g/t Au over 4.8 metres, and 5.6 g/t Au over 4.4 metres, and extending the continuity of the structures in all directions.\n• With two drills in use, 9,626 metres were drilled at the Barry Project, located in the Urban-Barry Camp 110 km south of the Bachelor mill, during the quarter. These drill results have established:\nThe presence of a series of high grade gold sub-vertical shears below the three small pits, 1,500 metres along strike length, and a depth exceeding 440 metres, that remains open in all directions; The presence of a series of gold bearing tension veins associated with the shears; In January, new high-grade intercepts of 14.3g/t Au over 4.6 metres and 10.4 g/t Au over 4.5 metres are made; In February, step out drilling extended the Main Zone at depth with intercepts 21.2 g/t Au over 1.7 metres, 31.5 g/t Au over 1.1 meters and 24.7 g/t Au over 1.5 metres; In March, new high-grade shear zone intercepts of 18.9 g/t Au over 1.6 metres in at the new Bart zone, located 3.5 km west of the Barry Project Deposit (These new exploration drill results are SW of the Windfall trend and are found in gold bearing shears/veins, hosted within a Diorite/Gabbro intrusion). Metanor completed 12 holes for a total of 2985 metres, designed to test historical gold grades in the area from previous operators, such as 23.8 g/t Au over 4.4 metres and 11.8 g/t Au over 6.5 metres in the Bart Zone; and the exploration team has been able to identify and confirm gold bearing shears/veins within the mafic intrusive host.\nOTHER EVENTS\n• In April, the Barry Project Deposit is expanded eastward and at depth with high grade intercepts including 15.8 g/t Au over 1.5 metres and 12.3 g/t Au over 1.3 metres, demonstrating the continuity and predictability of the Barry shear hosted gold deposit.\n• In May, intersects of 19.1 g/t Au over 3.6 metres at the Bachelor Mine down-plunge of Main Vein pursuant to the underground drill campaign, which includes new high-grade results of 19.1 g/t Au over 3.6 metres, 12.0 g/t Au over 4.0 metres and 6.4 g/t Au over 21.8 metres. These new results have extended the deposit 183 metres or 600 feet below the lowest working level at Bachelor Mine and demonstrate the southeasterly plunging continuity to the deposit.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE QUARTER\nGold production of 6,654 ounces of gold leading to gold sales of 6,764 ounces from Bachelor Mine;\n$9,533,399 in gold sales, after sales of ounces in the stream agreement, at an average realized price of $1,683 per ounce sold (US$1,331/oz using an exchange rate of US$0.791/C$1.00);\nGross Loss of $458,878.\nPascal Hamelin, President and Chief Operating Officer states : “ Our results are in line with our rebuilding strategy. The robust increase in exploration has added a completely new dimension to the Bachelor Mine with the Moroy Zones extending continuously from surface to depth below 600 metres and the encouraging results at Barry lead us to believe that our strategy will pay off as we move towards significantly increase our production profile. ”\nOPERATION SUMMARY\nThree months\nEnded Three months\nEnded 31-Mar-18 31-Mar-17 Operational Summary Development/Drilling - metres Underground development Bachelor 1,362 1,230 Underground development Barry 14 0 Total Underground development 1,376 1,230 Diamond drilling Bachelor 7,625 7,975 Diamond drilling Barry 9,626 7,239 Diamond drilling Moroy 7,409 0 Diamond drilling Other 5,280 0 Total Diamond drilling 29,940 15,214 Tonnes milled 43,567 61,101 Feed grade (g/t) 4.9 5.0 Mill recovery rate (%) 96.4 96.4 Ounces produced 6,654 9,442 Ounces sold 6,764 10,881 Financial results Net sales $ (net streaming) 9,553,399 16,304,364 average realized price $ 1,683 1,498 average realized price US $ 1,331 1,133 Exchange rate US to CDN $ 0.791 0.76 Operating Costs $ 8,220,620 10,474,661 Qualified Persons\nPascal Hamelin, P.
