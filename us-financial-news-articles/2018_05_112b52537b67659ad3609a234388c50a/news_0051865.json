Although Osama Bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda who was killed by U.S. forces in 2011, was part of the same family, the company cut ties to him.\nOne of the sources said the 537 business units under the current company set-up would be rationalized, which could include them being sold off, wound down or merged. The remaining units will be placed under the new structure, the source said.\nAmong the units expected to remain under the new holding company will be a contractor that will retain the Saudi Binladin name as well as operational maintenance, real estate, energy and advanced technology and business investments, two sources said.\nThe company’s spokesman and the Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.\nLAYOFFS The overhaul is the latest challenge Binladin has faced in recent years after stalled projects, delayed payments and a temporary exclusion from new state contracts after a crane accident killed 107 people at Mecca’s Grand Mosque in 2015.\nThe group plans to lay off hundreds of staff as part of the restructuring, two separate sources familiar with the matter said. One of the sources said 750 staff were recently given one-month notice and would receive their financial rights in full.\nAnother source said most of the job cuts involved employees working at Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport, one of the company’s projects, which is almost finished although delayed beyond the initial May 1, 2018 completion date.\nThe source said another round of layoffs was expected.\nThe company has already shed thousands of workers in recent years, but also in recent weeks ordered hundreds of staff who had been on leave from the stalled King Abdullah Financial District project to return to work as the project restarted.\nTo try to turn around the company’s fortunes, the finance ministry has provided the company with around 11 billion riyals ($2.9 billion) of loans, sources told Reuters last month.\nThe money will be used to prioritize work on projects deemed critical to the government, as well as to pay staff and creditors, the people said, with one adding that further cash transfers from the government were possible in the near future.\nIn February, sources told Reuters the company had been awarded a contract in a project to build palaces for the king, crown prince and other senior royals at NEOM, a huge new business zone on the Red Sea coast.\nEditing by Ghaida Ghantous and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:17:51.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
