Thinking of calling it Pravda ...,\" he tweeted here\nHe followed that up with a series of tweets arguing that “sanctimonious” journalists were driven by constant pressure to generate clicks and earn advertising.\n“The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public,” he added.\nBy 9 a.m. ET, 583,000 people had voted on Musk's poll here with 88 percent supporting his plan.\nTesla has been fighting negative press for several months over production bottlenecks for its Model 3 sedan, crashes involving its cars and doubts raised by Wall Street over its cash position.\nEarlier this week, a review by the influential magazine Consumer Reports said its Model 3 sedan, despite many positives, had “big flaws,” including braking slower than a full-sized pickup truck. Musk has promised a fix in the next few days.\nThe billionaire businessman, who also runs rocket company SpaceX and underground transit venture Boring Company, uses Twitter to give commentary about various issues and gets thousands of likes and comments on his posts.\nHe has 21.8 million followers on the microblogging site.\nAndrew J. Hawkins, a transportation reporter with tech website The Verge, tweeted that Musk was slowly transforming into a media-baiting Trump figure “screaming irrationally about fake news”.\n“Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‘You’re just like Trump!’ Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones (sic)believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago,” Musk responded in a tweet.
