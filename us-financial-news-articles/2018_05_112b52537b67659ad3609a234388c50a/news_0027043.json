That comes on expectations that India won’t increase from the huge output this year that caught the global sugar trade by surprise.\nBiancheri’s statements run contrary to many in the market that project excess supplies could be above 7-8 million tonnes for next year, due to record output in India, the world’s second-largest producer after Brazil, and Thailand.\nStill, high stock levels will keep prices under pressure, Biancheri said.
