Links to the page now return a 404 error message. Fortune reached out to Roberts Space Industries, Star Citizen’s developer, for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.\nThe Star Citizen add-on reportedly comes with 117 ships and 163 other additional content like skins and upgrades. The game hasn’t even been officially released yet. Despite an initial projection for a 2014 release, Star Citizen’s debut was pushed back a number of times and is currently only available in alpha testing phase.\nHowever, the game’s fans have been willing to pour money into Star Citizen . The game has garnered more than $186 million in crowdfunding over the past few years from more than 2 million people, according to Roberts Space Industries’s website.
