All the shopping centres are adjacent to a powerful Carrefour hypermarket and are either leaders or co-leaders in their catchment area. The total acquisition cost was €182 million , with an overall average effective yield of 6.3% .\nThe portfolio comprises assets located in Andalusia (Seville, Cordoba and Puerto de Santa Maria in Cadiz), Catalonia (Barcelone) and Alicante.\nCarmila is pursuing its investment strategy by adding six new assets to its core target. It plans to use the different levers of its strategy on these assets to create value: refurbishment based on the “Air de famille” concept, revitalising the merchandising mix, optimising occupancy rates (averaging 95% 1 overall), developing specialty leasing, driving business growth using the digital marketing tools developed by Carmila (efficient websites, databases, “Le Kiosque des Services” and “Boost programs”), and extending the site, some of these assets having significant construction potential. The portfolio also offers considerable potential for growth in rentals over the next three to five years.\nWith the acquisition of Gran Via de Hortaleza in February 2018, more than 63,000 m² will have been added to Carmila’s Spanish portfolio in 2018 (+16%).\nThese acquisitions are financed by the €350 million bond issued in February (for more details, please see the company’s press release dated 28 February 2018).\n“This acquisition forms part of Carmila’s core strategy.

By doing so, we are expanding in our most dynamic market and accelerating the implementation of our acquisition plan by capturing the opportunities offered by the market.\nGiven the extensions already delivered since the IPO and the acquisitions made since the beginning of the year, Carmila is ahead of the €1.6-1.7 billion investment plan for the period 2017-2020, unveiled during the IPO”, explained Jacques Ehrmann, Carmila’s Chairman & CEO.\nAbout the La Sierra shopping centre in Cordoba\nLocated in Andalusia’s third-largest city by population and purchasing power (with a catchment area of 190,000 inhabitants), this city-centre site is a leading destination thanks to its hypermarket and as a shopping destination.
