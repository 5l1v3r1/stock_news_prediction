Its current chief, Jaroslav Reznik, came under criticism in his previous job as head of state news agency TASR for signing a deal with Russian news agency Sputnik, which the European Parliament has said is a tool for spreading propaganda and fake news. Sputnik denies the accusations, but Reznik later canceled the contract.\n“It is up to the serious media, especially public media, to combat fake news,” Reporters Without Borders said in an emailed statement about the sackings. “We have doubts about Mr. Reznik’s competence to combat fake news.”\nRTVS also fired a senior radio editor last month. Three radio reporters quit in protest.\nSlovak public anger with the authorities and their failure to tackle graft erupted after the killing of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak, who was shot at home with his fiancee in February by an unknown assailant. Kuciak had reported on graft allegations involving politically connected businessmen.\nWeekly protests attracting tens of thousands of people in March led to the resignation of long-serving prime minister Robert Fico, who once called journalists “dirty anti-Slovak prostitutes”.\nHis three-party coalition remains in power, led by Fico’s former deputy Peter Pellegrini.
