Financial terms were not disclosed.\nThese 3Wire businesses primarily distribute foodservice equipment parts, bringing unique value-added solutions to major chains and food equipment service companies. The origins of 3Wire’s foodservice parts distribution date back to independently owned industry pioneers Northern Parts, Pacific Coast Parts, and Restaurant Appliance Service, who came together under the 3Wire brand as part of IMI Cornelius, prior to becoming part of Marmon in 2014. 3Wire’s beverage parts distribution division and technical service support team will remain part of Marmon, will be re-branded, and will be the subject of a future announcement from Marmon.\n“This acquisition will further strengthen the differentiated value we bring to both our manufacturer and customer partners,” commented Steve Snower, CEO of PT Holdings, parent company of Parts Town. “3Wire has built an excellent team, a strong brand and very solid major account partnerships, along with innovative technology. We are really excited to welcome the 3Wire team to Parts Town and to build on the legacy of such a great organization.”\nFollowing the transaction, Jeff Audette, General Manager, will continue to lead the 3Wire foodservice parts distribution team as part of Parts Town. Tom McPeters, General Manager, will continue to lead the 3Wire field service team.\n“Jeff and Tom are proven industry leaders and have built outstanding teams,” states Snower. “We are excited to take the best of Parts Town and 3Wire, and create something truly special in the foodservice equipment parts space to strengthen our manufacturer and customer partnerships.”\nThe 3Wire brand will continue as part of Parts Town, with the businesses coming closer together in the coming months.\nJeff Audette adds, “This combination is incredibly compelling. We are ready for this next exciting chapter of growth and innovation as part of a dynamic, fast-growing team. We have enormous respect for Parts Town and believe that this partnership is a game changer for our manufacturers, our customers, and our team members.”\nTo learn more about Parts Town and its offerings, please visit www.partstown.com .\nAbout Parts Town\nParts Town is the market-leading distributor of genuine OEM (original equipment manufacturer) foodservice equipment parts.
