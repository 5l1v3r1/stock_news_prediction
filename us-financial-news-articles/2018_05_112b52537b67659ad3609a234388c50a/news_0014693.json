Terms were not disclosed.\nDescribed by The Dallas Morning News as an \" eye-popping modern building ,\" AC Hotel and Residence Inn Dallas by the Galleria is considered an anchor of the 400-plus-acre renovation corridor between the Galleria and Preston Road along LBJ Freeway that has been identified for redevelopment. According to the Morning News , the project, known as Dallas Midtown, is estimated to be valued at as much as $4 billion.\nAC Hotel and Residence Inn Dallas by the Galleria is a five-floor property with more than 17,000 square feet of combined meeting space. AC Hotel Dallas by the Galleria offers 140 carefully curated guest rooms that feature a sleek European style along with workstations and flat-panel TVs. Residence Inn Dallas by the Galleria offers 116 suites designed for longer-stay guests. Every guest room is a suite with studio, one-, and two-bedroom options that afford extended-stay guests more functional living space.\n\"We are extremely excited about the uniqueness of the property, both in terms of the design and amenities, and that it will contribute to the emergence of the Midtown area, which we know is an important goal for the City of Dallas,\" says David Perel, Managing Director, Head of Lodging Investments for Civitas. \"We believe that the dual branded nature of the project, along with the common areas and meeting space, will serve a broad variety of consumers. We continue to be attracted to the dual branded hotel concept, which provides efficiencies both in terms of development and operations. This is the second dual branded hotel we have developed within the City of Dallas and will continue to look for such opportunities both locally and regionally.\"\nCivitas' and Atlantic have jointly developed several hotels in the DFW Metroplex and within the Marriott International system over the past 18 months, including (in addition to the aforementioned property) the dual branded Aloft and Element Hotel at Dallas Love Field, the Residence Inn Dallas at the Canyon, and the soon-to-be-opened Springhill Suites McKinney.\nAbout Civitas Capital Group\nThe Civitas Capital Group family of companies provides a range of products and services for institutional investors, family offices, and qualified individuals.
