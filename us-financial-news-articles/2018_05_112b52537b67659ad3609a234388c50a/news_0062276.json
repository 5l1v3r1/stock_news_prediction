Unlike traditional artificial intelligence platforms, REFS analyzes data sets beyond correlation, instead inferring causal mechanisms between variables to answer questions such as: How will the patient respond to this treatment? What if we choose one intervention over another? REFS is the only commercially available platform that infers causal mechanisms from patient data at scale from traditional healthcare and emerging data sources to bring the promise of precision medicine within reach.\nAbout GNS Healthcare\nGNS Healthcare solves healthcare's matching problem for leading health plans, biopharma companies, and health systems. We transform massive and diverse data streams to precisely match therapeutics, procedures, and care management interventions to individuals, improving health outcomes and saving billions of dollars. Our causal learning and simulation platform, REFS, accelerates the discovery of what works for whom and why.\nwww.gnshealthcare.com\nMedia Contact:\nPatty Kellicker\nVP, Marketing\npkellicker@gnshealthcare.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gns-healthcare-names-ted-goldstein-silicon-valley-tech-innovator-and-scientific-program-director-of-computational-health-at-ucsf-to-its-strategic-advisory-board-300656905.html\nSOURCE GNS Healthcare", "external_links": ["https://www.gnshealthcare.com/strategic-advisory-board/", "http://www.gnshealthcare.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gns-healthcare-names-ted-goldstein-silicon-valley-tech-innovator-and-scientific-program-director-of-computational-health-at-ucsf-to-its-strategic-advisory-board-300656905.html"], "published": "2018-05-31T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:29:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
