He reiterated that the bank’s rate moves would be guided by incoming data and said it was too soon to say what impact rate hikes have had so far.\n“With Governor Poloz indicating that the economy still isn’t reflecting the full effects of the past three rate hikes, the Bank is likely to wait until July to pull the trigger again, and then spread out future rate hikes given the language surrounding the long lags implicit in monetary policy changes,” CIBC economist Royce Mendes said in a note to clients.\nPoloz said several forces were restraining Canada’s economy, including new mortgage rules, uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a range of competitiveness challenges.\n“Those forces will not last forever. As they fade, the need for continued monetary stimulus will also diminish and interest rates will naturally move higher,” Poloz said in his speech.\nWhile Canada’s record high household debt makes the economy more vulnerable, the bank’s cautious approach is helping to manage the risks, Poloz said.
