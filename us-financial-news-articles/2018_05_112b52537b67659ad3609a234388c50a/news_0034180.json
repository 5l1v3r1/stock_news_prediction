It had about 4.3 million SVT customers at the end of 2017.\nThe company has been encouraging customers to actively choose one of its fixed-term tariffs instead of the standard variable tariff ahead of the cap.\nMorgan Stanley said the proposed tariff cap is the biggest near term risk for Centrica and the brokerage expects legislation to be passed by parliament in the coming months.
