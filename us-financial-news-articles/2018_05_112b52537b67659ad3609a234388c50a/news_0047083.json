Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated in kind.\nYulia Skripal spoke to Reuters last week, saying her recovery had been “slow and extremely painful” and that she was lucky to have survived.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nHospital staff too said that they expected the Skripals would die as a result of the poisoning.\n“All the evidence was there that they would not survive,” said Stephen Jukes, an intensive care consultant who treated the Skripals a week after they arrived at the hospital.\nHe added that the medical team initially suspected the Skripals were suffering an opioid overdose before the diagnosis quickly changed.\nThe cathedral city of Salisbury was transformed by the incident, with major shopping areas cordoned off while decontamination of locations the Skripals visited took place.\nA policeman was admitted to hospital with symptoms after attending to the Skripals, and hospital staff feared that the incident might have been far more serious than first thought.
