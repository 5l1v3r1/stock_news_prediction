That was a mistake, and Im sorry.\"\nHis comments echo an apology last month to U.S. lawmakers, but questions remain over how Facebook let the leak happen and whether it is doing enough to prevent a recurrence.\nZuckerberg's appearance in Brussels comes three days before tough new EU rules on data protection take effect. Companies will be subject to fines of up to 4 percent of global turnover for breaching them.\nZuckerberg will stress Facebook's commitment to Europe, where it expects to employ 10,000 people by the end of the year.\n\"I believe deeply in what we're doing. And when we address these challenges, I know we'll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force here in Europe and around the world,\" he will say.\nSince the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has suspended 200 apps from its platforms as it investigates third-party apps that have access to large quantities of user data.\nCambridge Analytica and its British parent, SCL Elections Ltd, have declared bankruptcy and closed down.\nBut some European officials want a tougher line on big technology firms. Tommaso Valletti, chief economist at the European Commission's competition unit, said earlier on Tuesday Facebook and other technology giants could face more regulatory scrutiny because of their market power.\nFacebook's compliance with the new EU data rules will be closely watched, as will its efforts to tackle the spread of fake news ahead of European Parliamentary elections next year.\nAfter plunging when the data leak scandal broke in March, Facebook shares have recovered, helped by stronger-than-expected quarterly results.\nZuckerberg will go on to meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday but has so far declined to appear in front of British lawmakers.\n(Reporting by Julia Fioretti, Editing by Larry King and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:02:58.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
