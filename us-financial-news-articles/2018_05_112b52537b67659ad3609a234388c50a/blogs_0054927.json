He reiterated that the government was working with congressional leaders to eliminate the CIDE tax and reduce the PIS/Cofins tax on diesel, while compensating for lost revenue with additional payroll taxes.\nTemer called for \"a type of truce for two or three days at most for us to find a satisfactory solution for Brazilians and for the truckers.\"\nHowever, ABCAM said the strike will continue.\nIt was the first such meeting between the government and truckers since they began partially blocking roads in several states on Monday to protest surging diesel prices.\nState-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA on Wednesday announced the second reduction this week in diesel and gasoline prices - part of the company's new policy of announcing almost daily adjustments to reflect variations in global oil prices and foreign exchange rates.\nSince the truckers' protests started, Petrobras and the government have denied that there has been any political interference in the company's pricing decisions.\nSOY EXPORTS AT RISK\nBrazil is a key global supplier of grains, meat, coffee and sugar, most of which reach ports by road.\nConcerns that the protest could halt shipments of Brazil's record soy crop have contributed to the steepest rally in soy futures in 10 months in Chicago trading, with prices up 4.5 percent in four consecutive days of increases.\nOilseed trade group Abiove said some soybean crushers were suspending operations due to the protest. Sugarcane industry group Unica said certain mills had reduced harvesting work due to short fuel supplies.\nMeat processor Marfrig Global Foods SA said on Wednesday some of its plants are reducing or suspending output due to lack of deliveries during the protest.\nState airport operator Infraero suggested that passengers check with airlines on the status of their flights and warned carriers to check that there is enough jet fuel to refuel planes at airports before clearing flights.\nAccording to Petrobras, state and federal taxes make up 29 percent of the final price of diesel paid by consumers. The average retail price of diesel is now 3.595 reais per liter.\nPadilha said policymakers had already determined how to offset the elimination of the CIDE fuel tax, which represents about 1 percent of diesel costs. However, he said congressional leaders still had to find about 12.5 billion reais ($3.5 billion) in new revenue in order to halve for six months the PIS/Cofins tax, which makes up about 10 percent of diesel costs.\nHe said the Finance Ministry would also discuss with states a possible reduction of the ICMS state tax burden on diesel.\nHouse Speaker Rodrigo Maia has said he aims to put the plan to address the truckers' concerns to a vote next Tuesday.\n($1 = 3.6278 reais) (Reporting by Maria Carolina Marcello, Lisandra Paraguassu and Mateus Maia in Brasilia, Pedro Fonseca in Rio de Janeiro, Alberto Alerigi in Sao Paulo, and Karl Plume in Chicago Writing by Ana Mano and Jake Spring Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Frances Kerry and Bill Berkrot)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:16:02.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
