Federal labor law does not countenance such isolation of employees,\" Ginsburg said in a statement she read in court.\nThe ruling came in the biggest business case of the court's current term, which began in October runs through the end of June.\nGrowing numbers of employers have mandated that their employees sign waivers to guard against a rising tide of worker lawsuits on wage issues. Class-action litigation can result in large damages awards by juries and is harder for businesses to fight than cases brought by individual plaintiffs.\nThe NLRB argued that the waivers violate federal labor law and let companies evade their responsibilities under workplace statutes. Workers have fought back against the waivers, arguing that the cost of pursuing their cases individually in arbitration is prohibitively expensive.\nAbout one in four private-sector non-union employees have signed arbitration agreements that include class-action waivers, according to the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute. Workers have fought back against the waivers, arguing that the cost of pursuing their cases individually in arbitration is prohibitively expensive.\nLawyers representing businesses have said that resolving workplace disputes through arbitration with individual employees is a speedy and cost-effective alternative to class-action litigation.\nThe three consolidated cases that came before the court involved professional services firm Ernst & Young, gas station operator Murphy Oil and healthcare software company Epic Systems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:15:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
