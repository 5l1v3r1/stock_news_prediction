The entire crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, are presumed dead.\n“(Representatives of) China and Hong Kong believe that both vessels were to blame, but Iran, Panama and Bangladesh see the veering to the right by the Crystal as the cause of the disaster,” Iran’s state TV Quote: d Nader Pasandeh, the country’s representative on the investigating committee, as saying.\nPasandeh later told the television that a court will likely have to rule in the case.\n“The issue of the main cause of the disaster is a legal one and it will have to be decided by a court,” he said, without elaborating.\nThe Sanchi was carrying the equivalent of nearly 1 million barrels of ultra-light crude, plus its own fuel, to South Korea. According to the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, the collision led to the worst tanker spill in 35 years.
