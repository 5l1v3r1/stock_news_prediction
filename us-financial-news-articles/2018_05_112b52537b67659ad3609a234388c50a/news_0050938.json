These digests will include suggestions to participate in pitches and works in progress.\nThe launch will be in January 2019 and employees will join on a voluntary basis, added Publicis, which is the world’s third-biggest advertising group and whose rivals include WPP and Omnicom.\nPublicis did not say how much the initiative had cost and declined to provide an estimate of the productivity gains it might be seeking to achieve with this tool.\nReporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T10:46:05.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
