Patrick Grosso has assumed the role of chief administrative officer and Josh Walker has joined the company as chief operating officer.\n“More than 133 million Americans are living with a chronic condition. On top of feeling sick for the majority of their lives, they face hefty healthcare bills and have to manage complex treatment plans,” said Alison Wistner, Chief Executive Officer, UpWell. “I’m excited to lead a strong team of executives who truly embrace our mission to help our members feel normal again. As healthcare continues to evolve, each executive will play a vital role in shaping the next phase of UpWell. We have a huge opportunity to influence and disrupt the way we deliver healthcare and I’m confident that we have the best leaders in place to succeed.”\nGrosso, who brings 19 years of private and public company operations experience to UpWell, has assumed the role of chief administrative officer. He will oversee all business administration and legal functions and the development of strategic initiatives that help the company achieve core organizational objectives. Previously, he served as Skullcandy’s chief legal officer and vice president of strategic initiatives and corporate affairs, leading several departments internationally.\nWalker has joined the company as chief operating officer, bringing more than 15 years of healthcare experience and a reputation for strong leadership and catalyzing business growth. Prior to UpWell, Walker served as COO at both Imagine Health and Optum, UnitedHealth Group’s $40 billion health services arm. At UpWell, he will lead the technology, information technology, pharmacy operations, and project management teams.\n“We are very pleased to see UpWell’s continued expansion in the market, and could not be happier with the further additions to the management team these past several months,” said Ron Heinz, UpWell board member and managing partner at Signal Peak Ventures. “Alison has attracted a group of executives who are like-minded, yet offer very complimentary skill sets. The success of any organization is deep-rooted in its culture and leadership, and we have high expectations that this team will drive compelling solutions for members and partners for years to come.”\nGrosso and Walker are serving alongside Wistner and Chief Financial Officer Tony Sansone, who both joined the company upon its inception in late 2017. Wistner brought a range of investment experience from the venture capital world, specifically in healthcare services and IT. Sansone joined as a seasoned financial executive with experience at both private and public companies in complex rapid-growth and turnaround environments.\nUpWell has made several other additions to its leadership team to strengthen departments across the organization, including marketing, member services, and business development:\nValerie Adams Meffert joined UpWell as vice president of marketing earlier this year. In this role, she is responsible for UpWell’s brand, content, communications, and member experience. She was previously vice president of engagement at Mercato Partners, an active growth equity investor in the technology and branded consumer sectors. Josh Harris is UpWell’s new vice president of member services, leading the company’s member-facing and demand generation teams. Harris brings a wealth of experience in sales and customer experience to this role, previously having served as Clearlink’s vice president of sales, where he grew a team of 30 people into more than 1,000 employees over the span of eight years. Melissa Floren has been appointed vice president of strategic partnerships and is responsible for identifying, nurturing, and growing key relationships with industry partners to deliver on the UpWell vision. She joined UpWell after leading customer success and business development at Imagine Health, bringing years of healthcare experience to this new role.\n“We’re bolstering our leadership team at a critical time for the organization,” added Wistner. “I’m looking forward to working as a collective management team to explore ways to advance support for this massively underserved healthcare population.”\nUpWell empowers members to take control of their health by making it easier for them to get the medications and care they need at an affordable cost.
