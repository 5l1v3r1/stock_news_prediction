The index is now positive for the year. The S&P 500 also had a strong day, settling up 0.74 percent on Monday for its best day since May 10.\nAchuthan wasn't sure when Wall Street could begin taking the economic sluggishness more seriously . But he still concluded that stocks are \"cruising for a bruising right here.\"\n\"From an economic cycle risk point of view, the risk is rising,\" Achuthan said. \"We have further slowing to go.\"\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
