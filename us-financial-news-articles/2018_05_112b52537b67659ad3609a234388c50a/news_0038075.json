Joe Kaesar, the CEO of Germany’s Siemens, told CNN his company would not be able to do any new business with Tehran.\nIran has said it may start enriching uranium again if it can no longer see any economic benefit from sticking to the deal.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, however, denounced the accord, because it did not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its role in Middle East conflicts or what happens after the deal begins to expire in 2025.\nFrance, Germany and Britain are leading a European effort to safeguard Europe’s economic interests in Iran. But the reach of the U.S. financial system, the dominance of the dollar and the presence of European companies’ operations in the United States all weaken any potential EU counter-measures.\n“We have a situation where there is a will to impose sanctions on Europeans and a resentment towards European companies who are now being accused of supporting a terrorist state. With that in mind it’s a logical decision,” a European diplomat said of Total’s decision.\nTotal said it was working with French authorities towards trying to secure a waiver for the South Pars project. It said it had so far spent less than 40 million euros ($47 million) on the project and that pulling out would not impact the company’s production growth targets.\nIn an ironic twist, Trump’s decision to threaten European companies that continue to invest in Iran may open the door to Chinese rivals.\nTotal holds a 50.1 percent stake in the South Pars project. Chinese state-owned oil and gas company CNPC holds a 30 percent share and National Iranian Oil Co subsidiary Petropars 19.9 percent.\nIndustry sources told Reuters this week that CNPC was ready to take over Total’s stake project if it pulled out.\n($1 = 0.8463 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:02:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
