It also launched new private clothing brands.\nWhat’s more, Walmart has used sophisticated tech to better manage inventory, allowing it to avoid stock shortages in stores while simultaneously avoiding have too much merchandise in stores that slow the flow of new goods or that could lead to clearance sales.\nThat helped Walmart’s profit: adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.14 per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. Total revenue, including its Sam’s Club and Walmart International units, came in at $122.69 billion, above the $120.51 billion forecast.\nAt Sam’s Club, which this year closed 10 of its stores, comparable sales rose 3.8%, while at Walmart International net sales rose 4.5% to $28.3 billion, stripping out the effect of currency. Walmart also announced several big international deals as the quarter ended. In late April it said it would sell most of its British grocery chain Asda to Sainsbury. And in early May, Walmart announced a $16 billion purchase of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, stepping up its battle with Amazon overseas.
