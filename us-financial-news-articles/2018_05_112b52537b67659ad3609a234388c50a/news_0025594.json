All three were taken into custody on Wednesday and are now free on bail.\nPremium Point, which specialized in mortgage-related investments through hedge and private equity funds, managed assets valued at more than $5 billion at its peak, according to prosecutors. It filed for bankruptcy in March.\nAhuja founded the firm in 2008 after a four-year stint as head of the mortgage-backed securities group at Deutsche Bank AG.\nAuthorities said that from about 2014 to 2016, Ahuja, Majidi and Shor worked together to mark up the value of assets held in Premium’s hedge funds in reports to investors and potential investors, in part by getting fraudulent quotes on securities from “corrupt brokers.”\nWhen an unidentified person at the firm confronted Ahuja and Majidi about pressure to inflate asset values, Ahuja told the person to “put on your big boy pants,” the indictment said. The person eventually resigned, according to the indictment.\nAfter its auditor questioned the valuations in 2015, Premium Point told investors it had over-valued all of its funds by 13 percent to 15 percent from September 2015 to March 2016, prosecutors said.\nThe mismarking was even more serious in Premium’s flagship mortgage credit hedge fund, which was mismarked by 24 percent, and dated back to at least January 2014, the prosecutors added.
