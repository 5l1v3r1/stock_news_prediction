Excluding notable items, income from operations increased 11% driven by higher fee income as average account values grew 8% to $138 billion.\nTotal annuity deposits of $2.5 billion were up 25% from the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in variable annuities.

This increase is attributable to a lower reported tax rate as a result of tax reform and in-force growth, partially offset by lower variable investment income. Mortality results were slightly favorable to seasonal expectations.\nIndividual life sales of $163 million increased 3% versus the prior-year quarter driven by growth in VUL. Total Life Insurance sales were $173 million versus $181 million in the prior-year quarter as a result of lower Executive Benefits sales, which can fluctuate quarter to quarter.\nTotal Life Insurance in-force of $725 billion grew 4% over the prior-year quarter, and average account values of $49 billion increased 7% over the prior-year quarter.\nThe current quarter included no notable items. The prior-year quarter included a favorable item of $1 million related to a one-time tax adjustment.\nGroup Protection\nGroup Protection income from operations was $29 million in the quarter versus $7 million in the prior-year period.

A $15 million net loss from general account investments.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses\nThe company reported a net unrealized gain of $4.8 billion, pre-tax, on its available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2018. This compares to a net unrealized gain of $5.3 billion at March 31, 2017, with the year-over-year decline primarily driven by an increase in interest rates.\nCapital\nThe quarter’s average diluted share count of 222.3 million was down 3% from the first quarter of 2017, the result of repurchasing 7.5 million shares of stock at a cost of $525 million since March 31, 2017.\nBook Value\nAs of March 31, 2018, book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), of $73.09 increased 10% from a year ago.

Management also believes that using book value excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) enables investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations. Book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.\nFor the historical periods, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the GAAP measure may be included in this Appendix to the press release and/or are included in the Statistical Reports for the corresponding periods contained in the Earnings section of the Investor Relations page on our website: www.lfg.com/investor .\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures Used in this Press Release\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating revenues and adjusted operating return on equity (including and excluding average goodwill within average equity), excluding AOCI, using annualized adjusted income (loss) from operations are financial measures we use to evaluate and assess our results. Adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating revenues and adjusted operating return on equity (“ROE”), as used in the earnings release, are non-GAAP financial measures and do not replace GAAP net income (loss), revenues and ROE, the GAAP measures.\nAdjusted Income (Loss) from Operations\nWe exclude the after-tax effects of the following items from GAAP net income (loss) to arrive at adjusted income (loss) from operations:\nRealized gains and losses associated with the following (\"excluded realized gain (loss)\"): Sale or disposal of securities; Impairments of securities; Change in the fair value of derivative investments, embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and our trading securities; Change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit (\"GDB\") riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as \"GDB derivatives results\"; Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) (“embedded derivative reserves”), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as “GLB net derivative results”; Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“indexed annuity forward-starting option”); Changes in the fair value of equities securities; Change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services - Insurance - Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (\"benefit ratio unlocking\"); Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance; Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt; Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; Income (loss) from discontinued operations; Acquisition and integration costs related to mergers and acquisitions; and Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards, regulations and policy changes including the net impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAdjusted Operating Revenues\nAdjusted operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:\nExcluded realized gain (loss); Amortization of deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking; Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve charges on business sold through reinsurance; Revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.\nAdjusted Operating Return on Equity\nAdjusted return on equity measures how efficiently we generate profits from the resources provided by our net assets.\nIt is calculated by dividing annualized adjusted income (loss) from operations by average equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Management evaluates return on equity by both including and excluding average goodwill within average equity.\nDefinition of Notable Items\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations, excluding notable items is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items which, in management’s view, do not reflect the company’s normal, ongoing operations.\nWe believe highlighting notable items included in adjusted income (loss) from operations enables investors to better understand the fundamental trends in its results of operations and financial condition.\nBook Value Per Share Excluding AOCI\nBook value per share excluding AOCI is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure.\nIt is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by (b) common shares outstanding. We provide book value per share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations. Management believes book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per share is the GAAP measure.\nSpecial Note\nSales\nSales as reported consist of the following:\nMoneyGuard® – 15% of total expected premium deposits; Universal life (UL), indexed universal life (IUL), variable universal life (VUL) – first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received; Executive Benefits – single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate-owned UL and VUL, first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received; Term – 100% of annualized first-year premiums; Annuities – deposits from new and existing customers; and Group Protection – annualized first-year premiums from new policies.\nLincoln National Corporation\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Income from Operations (in millions, except per share data) For the Quarter Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Total Revenues $ 3,609 $ 3,500 Less: Excluded realized gain (loss) (35) (80) Amortization of DFEL on benefit ratio unlocking (1) 1 Amortization of deferred gains arising from reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance\n- 1 Total Adjusted Operating Revenues $ 3,645 $ 3,578 Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders – Diluted\n$ 365 $ 435 Less: Adjustment for deferred units of LNC stock in our deferred compensation plans (1)\n(2) - Net Income (Loss) 367 435 Less (2) : Excluded realized gain (loss) (28) (52) Benefit ratio unlocking (10) 45 Net impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (13) - Acquisition and integration costs related to mergers and acquisitions, after-tax\n(4) - Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt (19) - Adjusted Income (Loss) from Operations $ 441 $ 442 Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share – Diluted Net income (loss) $ 1.64 $ 1.89 Adjusted income (loss) from operations 1.97 1.92 Average Stockholders’ Equity Average Equity, including average AOCI $ 16,653 $ 14,725 Average AOCI 3,052 1,706 Average equity, excluding AOCI 13,601 13,019 Average goodwill 1,368 2,273 Average equity, excluding AOCI and goodwill $ 12,233 $ 10,746 Return on Equity, Including AOCI Net income (loss) with average equity including goodwill 8.8% 11.8% Return on Equity, Excluding AOCI Adjusted income (loss) from operations with average equity including goodwill\n13.0% 13.6% Adjusted income (loss) from operations with average equity excluding goodwill\n14.4% 16.4% (1) The numerator used in the calculation of our diluted EPS is adjusted to remove the mark-to-market adjustment for deferred units of LNC stock in our deferred compensation plans if the effect of equity classification would result in a more dilutive EPS.
