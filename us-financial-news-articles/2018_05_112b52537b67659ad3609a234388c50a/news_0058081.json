Citigroup, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs fell between 1.2 percent and 1.6 percent.\n“The kick-off to a shortened trading week is looking ugly as Italy’s political woes weigh heavily on the global markets,” noted Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.\n“A crisis of confidence for the euro seems almost inevitable, which is fortifying the greenback and sending bond yields lower as the safety trade overrules.”\nAt 9:02 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 145 points, or 0.59 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 13 points, or 0.48 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 22.25 points, or 0.32 percent.\nAt these levels, the S&P 500 is set to open below its 100-day moving average, a key technical level. All 28 components of the blue-chip Dow were in the red in premarket trading.\nShares of energy companies were weighed down by an about 1 percent drop in U.S. crude futures to $67.16 on expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia could pump more crude to compensate for a potential supply shortfall.\nExxon Mobil fell 0.4 percent, while Chevron was down 0.8 percent. Halliburton slipped 1.5 percent.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday meetings were being held to set up a summit with North Korea and confirmed that a top North Korean official was en route to New York. The move is the latest indication that an on-again-off-again summit with Trump may go ahead.\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the Federal Reserve will find it difficult to raise interest rates beyond the settings of its Japanese and European counterparts, which are still pursuing accommodative policy.\nData for May consumer confidence index, due at 10:00 a.m., is likely to show a reading of 128.0, down from 128.7 the month before.
