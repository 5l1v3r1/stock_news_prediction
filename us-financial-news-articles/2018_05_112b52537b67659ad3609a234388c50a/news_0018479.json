(Nasdaq:CPTA) (“Capitala,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) today announced its first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet investment income of $4.4 million, or $0.28 per share Net asset value per share of $13.66 at March 31, 2018, compared to $13.91 at December 31, 2017 Deployed $27.8 million during the quarter, $27.0 million of first lien debt and $0.8 million of equity. The debt investments made during the quarter had a weighted average yield of 10.8%\nManagement Commentary\nIn describing the Company’s first quarter results, Joseph B. Alala, III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Operationally, our first quarter net investment income exceeded distributions, while NAV per share declined only slightly to $13.66 per share. All debt investments made during the quarter were senior debt structures, while 85% of all debt investments made over the last seven quarters were senior structures, thus validating the investment shift to less-risky and more senior debt focused investment strategy. We continue to build out our team of professionals, including the addition of a new partner who is opening a full service office in New York. Lastly, we recently announced the closing of a $1.0 billion pool of private capital, Capitala Specialty Lending Corp., which will significantly benefit the Company by providing substantial platform liquidity that allows the Company to be an active co-investor in new deals irrespective of liquidity limitations. Moreover, the Company benefits from the additional resources resulting from the growth of the investment adviser, including the addition of very talented seasoned professionals, the opening of new full service offices, and the upgrading of our investment adviser’s technology and software resources.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company originated $27.8 million of new investments, and received $21.4 million of repayments. Debt investments represented 97% of first quarter investment activity, all of which were first lien structures. The weighted average annualized yield on the first quarter debt investments was 10.8%.\nTotal investment income was $12.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Interest, fee and PIK income collectively were $1.8 million lower in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017, resulting from a decline in the Company’s investment portfolio and the impact of higher non-accrual balances. All other income decreased by $0.4 million from the comparable period.\nTotal expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $8.1 million, compared to $8.6 million for the comparable period in 2017. The decrease of $0.5 million is attributable to (1) a decrease in interest and financing expenses of $0.3 million, (2) a decrease of $0.1 million in incentive fees, net of the waiver, and (3) a $0.1 million decrease in all other expenses.\nNet investment income for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.4 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to $6.2 million, or $0.39 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nNet realized losses totaled $3.9 million, or $0.24 per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net gains of $4.8 million, or $0.31 per share, for the same period in 2017. During the quarter, the Company realized a loss related to American Exteriors, LLC ($4.6 million), partially offset by other gains totaling $0.7 million.\nNet unrealized depreciation totaled $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to depreciation of $6.2 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a tax expense of $50 thousand primarily related to net income from our blocker corporation. There was no tax provision for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net increase of $4.9 million, or $0.31 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nInvestment Portfolio\nAs of March 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 46 companies with a fair market value of $503.7 million and a cost basis of $469.2 million.

Non-accrual loans, on a fair value and cost basis, represent 4.0% and 9.5%, respectively, of the portfolio at March 31, 2018.
