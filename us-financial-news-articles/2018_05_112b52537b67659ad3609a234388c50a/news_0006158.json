(Nasdaq/MGPI), a leading supplier of premium distilled spirits and specialty wheat proteins and starches, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 first quarter results compared to 2017 first quarter results\nConsolidated net sales increased 0.9% to $88.0 million, reflecting growth in both the Distillery Products and Ingredient Solutions segments. Consolidated gross profit decreased 0.5% to $19.0 million, as a result of a decrease in gross profit in the Distillery Products segment, partially offset by an increase in the Ingredient Solutions segment. Consolidated gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 21.5%, from 21.8% in the prior year quarter. Consolidated net income increased 2.9% to $8.9 million, primarily due to the decline in the Company's effective tax rate resulting from implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Earnings per share increased to $0.52 per share from $0.50 per share in the prior year period, primarily due to the lower effective tax rate.\n“We continue to be very pleased with our progress against all parts of our strategic plan, and see no change in the macro consumer trends that are powering our growth. Our results this period reflect quarterly volatility resulting from changes in customer order timing for premium beverage alcohol,” said Gus Griffin, president and CEO of MGP Ingredients. “Since the initial implementation of our strategic plan in early 2015, this is the first time we have experienced a quarterly decline, either versus prior year quarter or sequential quarter, in sales of premium beverage alcohol. Despite that, this quarter was still a very strong period for sales of premium beverage alcohol, our third highest in recent history. Based on that, we are reconfirming our guidance for the full year.”\nDistillery Products Segment - Order Timing Impacts Quarterly Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net sales for the Distillery Products segment increased 0.6% to $74.4 million. Gross profit declined to $15.9 million, or 21.3% of net segment sales, compared to $16.6 million, or 22.5% of net segment sales in the first quarter 2017.\n\"We continued to experience strong demand for our bourbon and rye whiskeys, and continue to grow new distillate sales with existing and new customers,” said Griffin. “We do not feel the year-over-year decline in sales of premium beverage alcohol this quarter reflects any slow-down in our core business. We remain focused on the long term, and our plan for sustainable growth in premium beverage alcohol remains on track.”\nFood Grade Alcohol (in thousands) Net Sales Quarter Ended March 31, Quarter vs. Quarter Net Sales Change Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Premium Beverage Alcohol $ 44,071 $ 45,640 $ (1,569 ) (3.4 )% Industrial Alcohol 19,344 19,123 221 1.2 Food Grade Alcohol $ 63,415 $ 64,763 $ (1,348 ) (2.1 )% Ingredient Solutions - Gross Profit Grows 27%\nFor the 2018 first quarter, net sales in the Ingredient Solutions segment increased 2.7% to $13.6 million. Gross profit increased to $3.1 million, or 22.7% of net segment sales, compared to $2.4 million, or 18.4% of net segment sales in the first quarter 2017.\nGriffin said, “We are particularly pleased with the continued sales growth in both our fiber and textured wheat protein businesses. This quarter, versus prior year quarter, sales of our Fibersym specialty wheat starch product grew substantially and sales of our TruTex specialty wheat protein product more than doubled. We are confident in the macro consumer trends supporting this growth and are excited about the potential.”\nOther\nCorporate selling, general and administrative expenses were $8.6 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $7.6 million in the first quarter 2017, primarily due to investments in the MGP brands platform (personnel costs and advertising and promotion).\nThe corporate effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.3% compared with 24.7% in the year ago period.\nEarnings per share grew to $0.52 for the first quarter 2018, compared to $0.50 for the first quarter 2017.\n2018 and Long-Term Guidance\nMGP is confirming the following guidance for fiscal 2018 and beyond:\nOperating income is expected to grow between 10% and 15% for fiscal year 2018. The Company’s conservative estimate of growth in operating income in 2019 is 15% to 20% as sales of aged whiskey inventory become a more significant factor. 2018 net sales growth is projected in the high single-digit percentage range versus 2017, subject to some volatility as the Company continues to shift sales from industrial to premium beverage alcohol. 2018 gross margins are expected to continue to grow modestly versus 2017. 2018 effective tax rate is forecast to be 25%, and shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 16.9 million at year end.\nConclusion\n“Despite the quarterly volatility reflected in this period, we continue to be pleased with our progress against our long-term strategic plan. Key consumer trends impacting both business segments remain strong and there continues to be strong demand for our products,” Griffin added. “We continue to invest to take full advantage of the potential provided by these trends. Our warehouse expansion plan remains on track and our investment in aged whiskey has now reached $67.9 million, at cost.”\n“On the beverage side, while our core focus will always be supplying other brand owners with premium distilled spirits, we continue to be pleased with the progress of our brands initiative. This month we will be introducing two new whiskeys to our portfolio of premium spirit brands,” concluded Griffin.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMGP Ingredients will host a conference call for analysts and institutional investors at 10 a.m. ET today to discuss these results and current business trends.
