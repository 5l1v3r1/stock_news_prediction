The benchmark declined 0.7 percent on Tuesday.\nSantos on Tuesday ended talks with Harbour Energy and rebuffed its bid, saying it undervalued the firm in the context of the recent surge in oil prices.\nThe decision sent the Adelaide-based company’s shares tumbling 8.4 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one day fall in nearly one and a half years.\nThe news, paired with a fall in oil prices on Wednesday on fears of more OPEC supply, led to weakness in the wider sector, with the energy index slumping 2.3 percent to a two-week low.\nHealthcare stocks were also under pressure, with CSL Ltd slipping 1.1 percent, while Healthscope slid 2.1 percent.\nMeanwhile, financials registered a fifth straight day of losses, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia dipping 0.6 percent, while AMP Ltd dropped 2.2 percent.\nThe fall was capped by a rise in real estate stocks, with Goodman Group Pty Ltd jumping 2.4 percent to a near ten-year high.\nAcross the Tasman sea, New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.7 percent or 60.09 points to finish the session at 8,553.23.\nConsumer staples led the declines, with A2 Milk Company Ltd diving 4.4 percent, while Fonterra slumped 6.8 percent to a near two-year low.
