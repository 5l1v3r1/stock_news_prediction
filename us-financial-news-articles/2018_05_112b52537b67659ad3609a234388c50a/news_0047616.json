Cron’s solo homer.\nHowever, with Skaggs out of the game, the Rays knocked around the Angels’ bullpen starting in the seventh, doing most of their damage against Jim Johnson. The veteran right-hander lasted only one-third of an inning and gave up four runs (three earned) on four hits.\nDenard Span and Johnny Field also homered for Tampa Bay, which finished with 14 hits in all. Field finished 3-for-4 with his third homer of the season, and he contributed two runs and two RBIs.\nCron went 2-for-5 with two runs and a stolen base, his first of the season. He had spent his entire professional career in the Angels’ organization before being traded to the Rays for a minor-leaguer during the offseason.\nSkaggs was sharp early, giving up three hits (all singles) through five scoreless innings. And he was helped by his defense, which turned two double plays.\nIn the sixth, Cron got ahold of a changeup by Skaggs and hit it out for his team-leading 11th homer of the season.\nSkaggs (3-3) gave up one run on six hits and three walks in six innings. He struck out seven.\nThe only hits allowed by Archer (3-3) were singles by Justin Upton in the first and Andrelton Simmons in the fourth. Upton had to leave the game in the sixth inning after being hit by a pitch on his left hand. X-rays were negative, and he is listed as day-to-day.\nThe Angels scored their only run on Shohei Ohtani’s home run in the ninth inning off Pruitt, his sixth of the season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:13:39.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
