Many, however, also anticipate bumps along the road as higher yields periodically attract waves of buying.\nAlong with rising interest rates, Treasury yields have also been kept aloft recently by an expanding federal budget deficit.\nEarlier this year, a group of private banks that advise the Treasury—known as the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, or TBAC—estimated the Treasury would need to borrow a net $955 billion in the fiscal year that ends Sep. 30, up substantially from the $519 billion it borrowed in the previous fiscal year.\nThe Treasury is scheduled on Wednesday to release its latest refunding announcement, which should provide more details about how it intends to meet its borrowing needs. To date, the department has increased issuance of short-term debt more than long-term bonds, a decision that analysts say has helped lead to a flatter yield-curve, or narrower gap between short and long-term Treasury yields.\nIf Treasury officials “start leaning toward more long-end issuance, I think that would definitely surprise the market,” causing the yield-curve to steepen, said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale SA.\nThe Fed on Wednesday will also finish a two-day policy meeting. While it isn’t expected to raise interest rates, it will release a policy statement that will be closely scrutinized for hints about its future plans.\nWrite to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T01:12:30.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
