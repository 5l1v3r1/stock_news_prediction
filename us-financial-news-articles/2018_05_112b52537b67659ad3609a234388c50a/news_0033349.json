Both countries deny that accusation.\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for the unprecedented attacks in Iran, in which suicide bombers and gunmen attacked the parliament and Khomeini’s mausoleum in Tehran.\nEighteen other suspects still face charges over the attacks, according to state media.\nIran has said that the five gunmen and suicide bombers who were killed had fought in Syria and Iraq, where Islamic State once held swathes of territory but is now in decline.\nReporting by Dubai newsroom; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T09:23:30.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
