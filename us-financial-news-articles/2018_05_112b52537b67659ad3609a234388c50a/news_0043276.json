The company has been trying to cut prices to fend off German rival Zooplus.\nBritish bicycles to car parts retailer Halfords fell 11.7 percent to the lowest since the beginning of April after it warned profits were unlikely to grow this year.\nInmarsat dropped 7 percent on the back of concerns that its monopoly in maritime safety communications could come under threat from rival Iridium Communications.\nAmong winners, sandwich maker Greencore surged 5.1 percent following some well-received half-year earnings.
