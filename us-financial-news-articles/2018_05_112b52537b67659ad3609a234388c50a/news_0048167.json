Will withdraw offer to acquire the Company if the Special Committee refuses to commit to an expedited conclusion of the sales process.\nMIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- George Feldenkreis, the largest shareholder of Perry Ellis International, Inc. (\"Perry Ellis\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: PERY) with approximately 10.8% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, today sent a letter to the special committee of the board of directors of Perry Ellis (the \"Special Committee\") urging it to immediately commit to an expedited timeline to conclude negotiations and enter into a definitive agreement in respect of Mr. Feldenkreis’ previously announced formal proposal, backed by full financing, to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Perry Ellis not already beneficially owned by Mr. Feldenkreis at a price of $27.50 per share (the “Proposal”). Mr. Feldenkreis has nominated four highly qualified directors for election to the Company’s board of directors at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders to preserve his rights as a shareholder.\nThe full text of the letter follows:\nMay 23, 2018\nPerry Ellis International, Inc.\n3000 N.W. 107th Avenue\nMiami, Florida 33172\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nSince announcing my offer to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Perry Ellis not already beneficially owned by me at a price of $27.50 per share (the “Proposal”) on February 6, 2018, I have negotiated with the Special Committee of the board of directors of Perry Ellis (the “Special Committee”) in good faith. My Proposal offers a high certainty of closing for shareholders with our due diligence complete and financing in place. My advisors and I have quickly and completely responded to the Special Committee’s numerous requests for information and documentation in respect of the Proposal and are prepared to finalize and execute a definitive agreement immediately.\nUnfortunately, this courtesy has not been returned by the Special Committee, and we continue to be met with unjustifiable delays in the process to the detriment of all shareholders. As this process has been extended to almost four months, significant time and resources have been expended, which undoubtedly will diminish the value that shareholders will receive.\nPerry Ellis shareholders deserve the opportunity to accept an attractive all-cash premium for their shares. The Special Committee must commit to an expedited timeline that would see the conclusion of negotiations and the entry into a definitive agreement by May 29, 2018. If the Special Committee cannot commit to that time frame, I will withdraw my Proposal and pursue all other rights as a shareholder.\nI look forward to your prompt response.\nSincerely,\nGeorge Feldenkreis\nAbout George Feldenkreis:\nGeorge Feldenkreis is the founder of Supreme International, which started designing and importing apparel in 1967, eventually went public in 1993, and changed its name to Perry Ellis International, Inc. upon completing the acquisition of the brand in 2000.
