(\"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"TCPC\" or the \"Company\"), a business development company (\"BDC\") (NASDAQ: TCPC), today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and filed its Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $21.6 million, or $0.37 per share on a diluted basis, net of $0.09 per share in incentive compensation. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $27.2 million, or $0.46 per share. Net asset value per share at March 31, 2018 increased to $14.90 from $14.80 at December 31, 2017. Total acquisitions during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $169.1 million and total dispositions were $71.0 million. On February 26, 2018, we established a new $100 million revolving, multi-currency credit facility with ING Capital LLC, maturing on February 28, 2022 and generally bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. On May 9, 2018, our board of directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.36 per share payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 15, 2018. On April 17, 2018 Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC, our investment advisor (the \"Advisor\"), entered into a definitive agreement with BlackRock, Inc. (\"BlackRock\"), pursuant to which the Advisor will be merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, with the Advisor being the surviving entity after the merger.\n\"We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the first quarter of 2018, as we out-earned our dividend for the 24 th consecutive quarter,\" said Howard Levkowitz, TCP Capital Corp. Chairman and CEO. \"In the first quarter, we originated over $169 million in loans, with net deployments of approximately $98 million leveraging our robust direct origination platform. We continue to source attractive investment opportunities, while remaining highly selective and disciplined. We are excited about our recently announced transaction with BlackRock and believe it will further enhance our ability to deliver strong results for shareholders.\"\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of March 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of debt and equity positions in 97 portfolio companies with a total fair value of approximately $1.62 billion. Debt positions represented approximately 96% of the portfolio at fair value, the majority of which were senior secured debt. Equity positions, including equity interests in portfolios of debt and lease assets, represented approximately 4% of our investment portfolio.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the weighted average annual effective yield of our debt portfolio was approximately 11.3% and the weighted average annual effective yield of our total portfolio was approximately 11.0%. (1) As of March 31, 2018, approximately 88% of our debt portfolio at fair value had floating interest rates. As of March 31, 2018, we had one debt investment on non-accrual status, totaling zero percent of the portfolio at fair value.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we invested approximately $169.1 million, primarily in twelve investments, comprised of six new and six existing portfolio companies. The investments were comprised of approximately $126.8 million in senior secured loans and $38.0 million in senior secured notes. The remaining $4.3 million represented additional equity interests in a portfolio of debt assets. Additionally, we received proceeds from sales and repayments of investment principal of approximately $71.0 million. We expect to continue to invest in senior secured loans, bonds and subordinated debt, as well as select equity investments, to obtain a high level of current income and create the potential for appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection.\nAs of March 31, 2018, total assets were $1,665.6 million, net assets applicable to common shareholders were $876.6 million and net asset value per share was $14.90, as compared to $1,629.4 million, $870.7 million, and $14.80 per share, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $44.2 million, or $0.75 per share, including $0.03 per share from prepayment premiums and related accelerated original issue discount and exit fee amortization, $0.03 per share from recurring original issue discount and exit fee amortization and $0.05 per share from recurring income paid in kind. This reflects our policy of recording interest income, adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts, on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment, and similar upfront fees received in connection with the outlay of capital are generally amortized into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment.\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $22.6 million, or $0.38 per share, including interest and other debt expenses of $9.6 million, or $0.16 per share and incentive compensation from net investment income of $5.4 million, or $0.09 per share. Excluding incentive compensation, interest and other debt expenses, annualized first quarter expenses were 3.5% of average net assets.\nNet investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $21.6 million, or $0.37 per share. Net investment income is net of incentive compensation as the incentive compensation structure was converted from a partnership profit allocation to a fee effective January 1, 2018. This conversion had no impact on the amount of the incentive compensation paid or services received by the Company.\nNet realized and unrealized gains for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $5.6 million, or $0.09 per share, comprised primarily of a $1.9 million increase in value of our investment in NEG Parent (CORE Entertainment), as well as various market gains resulting from generally tighter spreads.\nNet increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $27.2 million, or $0.46 per share.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of March 31, 2018, available liquidity was approximately $254.5 million, comprised of approximately $242.0 million in available capacity under our leverage program and $13.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, less approximately $1.2 million in net outstanding settlements.\nThe combined weighted-average interest rate on debt outstanding at March 31, 2018 was 4.18%.\nTotal debt outstanding at March 31, 2018 was as follows:\nMaturity\nRate\nCarrying Value (1)\nAvailable\nTotal Capacity\nSVCP 2022 Facility\n2022\nL+2.25%\n$\n56,995,000\n$\n43,005,000\n$\n100,000,000\n2019 Convertible Notes ($108 million par)\n2019\n5.25%\n107,131,572\n—\n107,131,572\n2022 Convertible Notes ($140 million par)\n2022\n4.625%\n137,546,442\n—\n137,546,442\n2022 Notes ($175 million par)\n2022\n4.125%\n174,436,660\n—\n174,436,660\nTCPC Funding Facility\n2021\nL+2.50% (2)\n203,000,000\n147,000,000\n350,000,000\nSBA Debentures\n2024−2028\n2.63% (3)\n98,000,000\n52,000,000\n150,000,000\nTotal leverage\n777,109,674\n$\n242,005,000\n$\n1,019,114,674\nUnamortized issuance costs\n(8,454,219)\nDebt, net of unamortized issuance costs\n$\n768,655,455\n(1)\nExcept for the convertible notes and the 2022 Notes, all carrying values are the same as the principal amounts outstanding.\n(2)\nOr L+2.25% subject to certain funding requirements\n(3)\nWeighted-average interest rate on pooled loans, excluding fees of 0.36% or 0.35%. As of March 31, 2018, $15.0 million of the outstanding amount was not yet pooled, and bore interest at a temporary weighted-average rate of 2.72% plus fees of 0.35% through September 19, 2018, the date of the next SBA pooling.\nOn May 9, 2018, our board of directors re-approved our stock repurchase plan to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 11,300 shares for a total cost of $0.16 million.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn April 17, 2018 Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC, our investment advisor (the \"Advisor\"), entered into a definitive agreement with BlackRock, Inc. (\"BlackRock\"), pursuant to which the Advisor will be merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, with the Advisor being the surviving entity after the merger.\nOn May 9, 2018, our board of directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.36 per share payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nTCP Capital Corp. will host a conference call on Wednesday May 9, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its financial results.
