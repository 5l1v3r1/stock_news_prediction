The figure has lately been revised upwards to $11 billion with renewed interest in our sector,” Manhando said.\nZimbabwe holds the second largest deposits of platinum and chrome after South Africa and has lately seen increased interest from lithium investors, who however say funding still remains a hurdle.\nManhando said mining companies in Zimbabwe faced problems that included high costs of electricity, labor and royalty fees when compared to other jurisdictions. There had also been little exploration in the country since 2000, he added.\nEquipment at most mines was more than 50 years old, severely undermining efficiency and cost effectiveness of the sector, said Manhando.\nMines Minister Winston Chitando said the government would announce a new “mining vision” at the end of June and projected that the output of gold could rise to 85 tonnes in five years.\nOutput of gold, the biggest mineral by earnings, is expected to rise to 30 tonnes this year from 23 tonnes in 2017, according to Ministry of Mines data.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:13:10.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
