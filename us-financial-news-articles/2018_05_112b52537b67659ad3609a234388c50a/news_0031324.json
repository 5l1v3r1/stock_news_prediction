(NASDAQ:YGYI), a leading omni-direct lifestyle company, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 First Quarter Highlights:\nRevenues increased 11.0% over the prior year to $43.0 million\nGross Profit increased 14.4% to $25.0 million compared to the prior year\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $1.5 million compared to negative $1.2 million in the prior year\nThe Coffee Segment posted 39.9% revenue growth over prior year\nSteve Wallach, Chairman and CEO of Youngevity stated, “We are pleased to see revenue growth for both segments in the first quarter. Our international markets are beginning to contribute more significantly to overall revenue lead by top line growth coming from Asia. We believe this overall growth is sustainable in the coming quarters.”\nDave Briskie, President and CFO of Youngevity said, “We have been focused on the fundamentals as we entered 2018. We feel we made significant progress by improving adjusted EBITDA and strengthening our balance sheet as well. The recent financing and debt conversion contributed significantly to the improvement in our Stockholders’ Equity and will help reduce borrowing costs in the coming quarters.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues increased 11.0% to $42,994,000 in the current period as compared to $38,733,000 for the same period last year. We derived approximately 82% of our revenue from direct selling sales and approximately 18% from commercial coffee sales. Direct selling revenues increased by $2,069,000 or 6.2% to $35,311,000 as compared to $33,242,000 for the same period last year. Commercial coffee revenues increased by $2,192,000 or 39.9% to $7,683,000 as compared to $5,491,000 for the same period last year.\nGross profit increased 14.4% to $25,012,000 in the current period as compared to $21,866,000 for the same period last year. Overall gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 58.2%, compared to 56.5% in the same period last year.\nTotal operating expenses increased 3.0% to $24,988,000 in the current period, compared to $24,266,000 for the same period last year.\nA breakdown of operating expenses is as follows:\nDistributor compensation in the direct selling segment increased 1.0% to $15,578,000 compared to $15,419,000 for the same period last year.\nSales and marketing expense decreased 4.8% to $3,499,000 from $3,675,000 for the same period last year, primarily due to a reduction in distributor events.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased 14.3% to $5,911,000 from $5,172,000 for the same period last year, primarily due to increases in amortization costs, non-cash compensation costs and increased general and administration costs at the commercial coffee segment as well as increased international costs, primarily related to operations in Russia, Mexico, Taiwan and New Zealand.\nTotal other expense increased by $1,495,000 to $2,082,000 as compared to $587,000 for the same period last year. Total other expense includes net interest expense, the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities and extinguishment loss on debt. Net interest expense increased by $515,000 in the current quarter to $1,712,000, and the change in fair value of derivative liabilities increased by $102,000 in the current quarter to $712,000 which resulted in a reduction to other expense. We also recorded a non-cash extinguishment loss on debt of $1,082,000 in the current period as a result of the triggering of the automatic conversion of our 2017 Notes associated with our July 2017 Private Placement to common stock.\nThe Company has recognized an income tax expense of $250,000, which is the estimated federal, state and foreign income tax expense for the current quarter, compared to an income tax benefit of $928,000 for the same period in the prior year.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $2,308,000 in the current period as compared to net loss of $2,059,000 for the same period last year. This increase in net loss was as a result of the increases in other expense, income taxes and operating expense, partially offset by an increase in gross profit.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as adjusted to remove the effect of stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt and the change in the fair value of the derivatives or \"Adjusted EBITDA,\" increased to $1,520,000 for the current period compared to negative $1,237,000 in the same period last year.\nConference Call Information\nManagement will host a conference call today at 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time (1:15 PM Pacific Daylight Time), to discuss the Company's first quarter financial results, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our Company and our management team.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by taking net income, and adding back the expenses related to interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and change in the fair value of the warrant derivative, as each of those elements are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance or financial position, as Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided in the tables at the end of this press release.\nAbout Youngevity International, Inc.\nYoungevity International, Inc.
