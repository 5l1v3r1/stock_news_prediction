The Dow is down almost 2 percent this year, while the S&P 500 is off about 1 percent.\n\"Ultimately, the market moves with the direction of earnings. That is definitely going to be positive for the foreseeable future,\" he added.\nBut Dwyer, whose S&P 500 year-end target of 3,100 is the second highest on the Street , doesn't see a positive period between May and September blowing the socks off investors.\n\"May is seasonably a weaker period,\" he said. \"It may not be the best part of the gain. But again, you should have a gain.\"\nTo capitalize the most during that stretch, Dwyer recommends what he calls \"productivity trade\" â€” areas that are positioned to offset higher inflation, particularly in labor. Inflation concerns have been looming over the strong earnings and economic fundamentals.\n\"Who funds productivity? That would be the financials and capital markets companies. How do you implement it? That would be the industrial automation companies,\" Dwyer said. \"And, what's behind that? That would be the technology companies: software, hardware, services.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T14:50:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
