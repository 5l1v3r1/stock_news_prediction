Human Rights Office’s mandate, gather first-hand information about what happened during the protests and to resume contact with the authorities and others in the country,” Shamdasani said.\nThe U.N. was waiting for the government’s reply, she said at a news briefing.\nShe said the U.N. noted that the Nicaraguan National Assembly had created a truth commission to investigate the deaths and allegations of torture and enforced disappearances during the protests.\n“For its investigations to be credible, the commission must be independent, and able to conduct its work in a transparent and impartial manner,” Shamdasani said.
