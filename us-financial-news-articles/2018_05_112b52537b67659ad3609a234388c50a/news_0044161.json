REUTERS/Thomas Peter\nSouth Korea expressed regret that its journalists had not been included after earlier being invited.\n“Nonetheless, the government pays due attention to the fact that the North’s pledge to dismantle the Punggyeri nuclear test site, an initial measure for denuclearisation, is proceeding as planned, and expects that such action to lead to the successful hosting of the North Korea-U.S. summit,” South Korea’s Unification Ministry said in a statement.\nLast month, Moon and Kim held a historic summit at the Demilitarised Zone separating the two countries.\nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\nNorth Korea has rejected unilateral disarmament and given no indication that it is willing to go beyond statements of broad support for the concept of universal denuclearisation.
