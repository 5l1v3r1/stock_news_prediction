Luis Posada Carriles (R), 82, walks with his lawyers after leaving the court in El Paso, Texas January 10, 2011. Posada Carriles is on trial in an immigration case in which he is accused of lying on his entry to the United States. REUTERS/Gael Gonzalez\nPosada Carriles was considered a hero by some Cuban exiles for his attempts to topple Fidel Castro’s government following the 1959 revolution, while Cuba called him a terrorist unjustly given haven by the United States.\n“The biggest terrorist of this hemisphere died without paying his debts to justice or reparations to the victims,” wrote Sergio Alejandro Gomez, the international editor of Granma, the official newspaper of Cuba’s Communist Party, on Facebook.\n“He died in Miami, the United States, the country that trained him to lay bombs and attack the lives of hundreds of Cubans.”\nCuba has accused the United States of double standards in its war on terrorism for failing to make Posada Carriles face justice.\nTrained by the CIA for its disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion to oust Castro in 1961, Posada Carriles was jailed in Venezuela for the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people. But he escaped in 1985.\nCuba also accuses Posada Carriles of planning a wave of bomb blasts in Havana hotels in 1997 that killed an Italian tourist and of plotting to blow up Castro during a presidential summit in Panama in 2000.\n“The death of Luis Posada Carriles ends the final chapter of the long saga of Cuban American terrorism — terrorism that targeted not just Cuba but also Cuban Americans advocating reconciliation,” said William LeoGrande, an American University professor of government and co-author of a book on secret U.S.-Cuba talks that led to detente under former U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuba’s Raoul Castro.\n“Groups like Omega 7 and Alpha 66 set off more bombs in Miami than they did in Havana,” LeoGrande said, referring to militant anti-Castro groups.
