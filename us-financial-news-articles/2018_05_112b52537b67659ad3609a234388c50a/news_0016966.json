They bought $345 million and sold $325 million.\nQualified foreign institutions which invest directly were net buyers by a ratio of more than two to one, while direct investors using swaps were net sellers.\nForeign portfolio funds have been flooding into Saudi Arabia before Riyadhâ€™s expected inclusion in global emerging market indexes next year. But in the week through April 26, foreigners were net sellers for the first time this year, to the tune of $48 million.
