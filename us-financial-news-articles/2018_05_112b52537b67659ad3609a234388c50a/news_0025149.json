( NASDAQ: SMSI ), today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“I am pleased with the continued progress made during the first quarter of 2018,” said William W. Smith, Jr., President and CEO of Smith Micro Software. “Revenues for our Wireless business unit are moving in the right direction, as we have seen increases over the past two quarters with both our SafePath ® Family and CommSuite ® platforms as customer adoption rates increase.”\n“We also recently strengthened our balance sheet significantly, which will allow us to accelerate our product roadmaps and planned M&A activity in 2018. We believe we are very well positioned to continue executing on our strategic initiatives, resulting in expanded revenues and a return to profitability in the coming quarters.”\nFiscal First Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nSmith Micro Software reported revenue of $5.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.6 million reported in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 gross profit was $4.2 million, compared to $4.3 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 76 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 77 percent for the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.4 million, or $0.16 loss per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $2.9 million, or $0.24 loss per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net loss (which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, debt issuance and discount costs, fair value adjustments, and a normalized tax benefit) for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.5 million, or $0.10 loss per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $1.4 million, or $0.11 loss per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 were $3.7 million.\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company considers and has included in this press release certain non-GAAP financial measures, including a non-GAAP reconciliation of gross profit, income (loss) before taxes, net income (loss), and earnings (loss) per share in the presentation of financial results in this press release. Management believes this non-GAAP presentation may be more meaningful in analyzing our income generation and therefore has excluded the following non-cash items from GAAP earnings calculations: stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, fair value adjustments, and debt issuance and discount costs. Additionally, since we are in a cumulative loss position, a non-GAAP income tax benefit was computed using a 24 percent and 38 percent tax rate for 2018 and 2017, respectively, using the Company’s normalized combined U.S. federal, state, and foreign statutory tax rates less various tax adjustments. This presentation may be considered more indicative of our ongoing operational performance. The table below presents the differences between non-GAAP earnings and net loss on an absolute and per-share basis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and the non-financial measures as reported by Smith Micro Software may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\nInvestor Conference Call:\nSmith Micro Software will hold an investor conference call today, May 9, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EDT, to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results.
