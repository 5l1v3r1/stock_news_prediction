The advisory resolution on executive compensation was not approved by the stockholders.\nStockholders elected board members Abdulaziz F. Al Khayyal, William E. Albrecht, Alan M. Bennett, James R. Boyd, Milton Carroll, Nance K. Dicciani, Murry S. Gerber, José C. Grubisich, David J. Lesar, Robert A. Malone, Jeffrey A. Miller, and Debra L. Reed.\nWe are disappointed that our advisory resolution on executive compensation did not pass this year, but look forward to continuing our active engagement with our stockholders concerning our compensation program and other matters. Our Board of Directors has structured our program to align executive compensation with the creation of shareholder returns, which have exceeded our peers over the last one, three and five year periods and to attract, motivate, and retain executives which is especially important during a CEO transition period. This is the first time our annual executive compensation proposal has not passed.\nFounded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry.
