If the second review concludes successfully, the lender will disburse 38 million euros (33.5 million pounds) in additional funds, Parodi added.\nIn February, the IMF board signed off on a review of Bosnia’s 553-million-euro ($662 million) loan programme and approved a disbursement of a 74.6-million-euro loan tranche after it met key requirements.\nThe lender, which in 2016 approved a three-year loan deal for Bosnia, has extended it by 12 months and rescheduled payments on the request of Bosnian authorities. It also agreed to waivers on non-observance of performance criteria, saying the deviations were temporary and small.\nBosnia has presidential and parliamentary elections in October, and campaigning with nationalist overtones - which diplomats say is not helpful for the country’s economic development and EU ambitions - has been heating up.\nIn February, the IMF cut Bosnia’s 2018 economic growth forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.5 percent previously, citing downside risks from domestic politics even as macroeconomic conditions remained stable.
