That was just above analysts’ consensus estimate of 2.9 billion reais compiled by Thomson Reuters.\nOverall, Banco do Brasil’s loan book shrank 0.3 percent to 625 billion reais, mainly due to a decline in corporate loans. That puts it firmly below the bank’s target for loan book growth between 1 percent and 4 percent in 2018, excluding acquisitions of credit portfolios from other financial institutions.\nBTG Pactual analysts said in a client note the quarter was weaker than expected as more profitable loan books, such as credit to mid-sized companies, shrank.\nLoan-loss provisions came in at 4.2 billion reais, 28 percent below estimates, as delinquency rates declined on corporate loans. Banco do Brasil recorded a 90-day default ratio of 3.65 percent, slightly below the previous quarter.\nThe state-controlled bank’s recurring return on equity, a commonly used gauge of profitability, was 13.2 percent, slightly below a 13.28 percent consensus.\nCaffarelli said the bank would raise its payout ratio from 25 percent to 40 percent in 2018 due to its higher capital ratio that allows the bank to pay larger dividends.\n$1 = 3.5572 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl; Additional reporting by Paula Laier; Editing by Mark Potter and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:13:22.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
