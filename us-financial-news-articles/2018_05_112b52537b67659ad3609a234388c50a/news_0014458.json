Other world powers have not done so, sidestepping one of the thorniest disputes between Israel and the Palestinians, who want their own state with East Jerusalem as the capital.\nWorkmen installed the black-and-white signs, in English, Hebrew and Arabic, along roads leading to a U.S. consulate building in south Jerusalem that will be remodelled as the embassy when it is formally relocated from Tel Aviv on May 14.\n“This is not a dream. It is reality. I am proud and moved to have hung this morning the first new signs that were prepared for the U.S. Embassy,” Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat wrote on Twitter.\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem from Jordanian control in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The last round of peace talks on a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip collapsed in 2014.

The U.S. delegation will include Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as American Ambassador David Friedman and Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s Middle East peace negotiator, the White House said on Monday.

A restaurateur, she lives in the overwhelmingly Jewish neighbourhood of Arnona.\n“Welcome Trump, we belong here, forever. Jerusalem is our capital,” she said.\nThe Trump administration has left the diplomatic door open to a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians on defining Jerusalem’s borders.\n“By recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the seat of its government, we’re recognising reality,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a visit to Israel last week.
