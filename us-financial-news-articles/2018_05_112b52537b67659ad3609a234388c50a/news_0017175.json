Beyond securing endpoints, networks and the hybrid cloud, we anticipate a huge rise in the Internet of Things (IoT) and a convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT), driving new requirements for security. In addition to researching emerging threats in these areas, we are partnering with leading global device makers to best secure our customers now and in the future.”\nQ1 2018 Business Highlights\nAnticipating the next big wave:\nConnected devices of all kinds are better protected from cybercriminal abuse if security solutions are built in – not bolted on. To meet that need, in the first quarter of 2018 Trend Micro added partnerships with Panasonic and VIVOTEK to its ecosystem:\nPanasonic Corporation and Trend Micro announced a partnership to jointly develop a cybersecurity solution to detect and prevent cyberattacks against autonomous and connected cars. VIVOTEK and Trend Micro partnered to provide the first network surveillance solution with embedded security. Trend Micro IoT Security for Surveillance Cameras provides VIVOTEK’s newest network cameras with detection and prevention of suspicious activity.\nIn addition to partnerships with leading connected device makers, Trend Micro recently launched an independent venture fund through its partnership with Trend Forward Capital , focused on accelerating the success of entrepreneurs working to unlock a smart connected and secure world. New investments in Q1 2018 include Lief and Humon, which are IoT focused, as well as Instabug, which offers a software development kit for application developers. These complement its first investments, which include Veem , Muse and Mojio .\nTraining and research to secure the connected world\nTrend Micro Research is constantly hunting for new threats and anticipating how changing technologies will impact the security landscape. The convergence of IT and OT systems proves to be a top area targeted by a growing number of threats. Trend Micro’s 2017 Roundup Report notes that attackers are targeting the changing IT environment, including connected devices that open a new attack surface.\nTo meet the security demands of the evolving technology infrastructure, businesses need more security-conscious employees to help fight the ongoing battle against cybercrime. Trend Micro has four global training centers that educate and equip hundreds of young professionals to be cybersecurity practitioners in any industry or business.\nAdditionally, to empower better digital citizens in the future, Trend Micro’s Internet Safety for Kids & Families program launched its annual contest to help students be more cybersecurity and privacy conscious. This year’s “What’s Your Story?” contest encourages better security awareness in an increasingly complicated digital landscape.\nProtecting customers through product innovation and strategic investments\nTrend Micro’s flagship product lines continue to earn valued industry recognition from third-party testing firms like NSS Labs, and market-leading analyst firms like Gartner, Inc.\nThe company earned the prestigious “Recommended” rating from NSS Labs in the Data Center IPS category. Trend Micro’s TippingPoint TX Series received this recognition by demonstrating its ability to provide effective, high-speed inline network inspection without sacrificing performance.\nTrend Micro was also named a Leader in Gartner, Inc.’s 2018 Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms, as well as a Leader in Gartner, Inc.’s 2018 Magic Quadrant for Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems. These reports demonstrate Trend Micro’s commitment to protecting businesses across a range of IT environments.\nPatents\nTrend Micro was awarded the following patents in Q1 2018:\nPatent No.\nIssue Date\nTitle\n9858413 01/02/2018 Reduction of False Positives in Malware Detection Using File Property Analysis 9882768 01/30/2018 Methods and Apparatus for File Synchronization over a Computer Network 9817974 03/13/2018 A Novel Method of Android App 3rd-Party SDK Detection 9917855 03/13/2018 Mixed Analysys-Based Virtual Machine Sandbox 9916480 03/13/2018 Security Apparatus to House a Device Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements that are made in this release are forward-looking statements.
