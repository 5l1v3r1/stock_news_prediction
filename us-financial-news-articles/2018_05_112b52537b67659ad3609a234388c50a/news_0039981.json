They should continue to have this freedom,” he said.\n“But what is important is that companies and especially medium-sized companies which are perhaps less exposed to other markets, American or others, can make this choice freely.”\nFrance, Macron said, backed proposals by the European Commission to protect and compensate European companies that might be hit by U.S. sanctions for trading with Iran.\nIn broader trade disputes with Washington, he also called for a complete exemption for the EU from new U.S. steel tariffs and said Europe must preserve its “trade sovereignty”.
