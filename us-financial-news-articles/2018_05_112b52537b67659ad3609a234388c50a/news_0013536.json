(NASDAQ:ATXI) (“Avenue”), a company focused on the development and commercialization of intravenous (IV) tramadol, today reported financial results and recent corporate highlights for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We recently completed enrollment in our first pivotal Phase 3 trial of IV tramadol for the treatment of postoperative pain in patients following bunionectomy surgery. Topline data from the trial are anticipated this quarter and, if positive, we expect to initiate our second Phase 3 trial in patients following abdominoplasty surgery in the third quarter of 2018,” said Lucy Lu, M.D., Avenue’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Coupled with recent additions to our patent portfolio, which was strengthened by the receipt of Notices of Allowance for three patent applications in the first quarter, we are making progress toward our goal of introducing IV tramadol as a treatment option for use in the management of postoperative pain. Patients and physicians have an increasingly pressing need for medicines that can provide rapid and sustained relief without also introducing the risk of opioid dependence, and we are working hard to advance IV tramadol to address this gap in the acute pain space.”\nFirst Quarter and Recent Achievements:\nIn April 2018, Avenue completed enrollment in its Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, three-arm clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV tramadol 50 mg and 25 mg versus placebo for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients following bunionectomy surgery. Avenue expects to report topline data in the second quarter of 2018. In March 2018, Avenue received Notices of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for three patent applications covering methods of administration for IV tramadol. Issuance of these patents is expected in the second quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Results:\nCash Position: As of March 31, 2018, Avenue’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $15.0 million, compared to $21.8 million at December 31, 2017. The $6.8 million decrease was primarily attributable to the continued development of IV tramadol. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $9.4 million, compared to $0.1 million for the same quarter in 2017. The $9.3 million increase was primarily attributable to the ongoing Phase 3 trial of IV tramadol following bunionectomy surgery and to the Phase 3 safety trial of IV tramadol. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $1.0 million, compared to $0.4 million for the same quarter in 2017. The $0.6 million increase was primarily attributable to increases in non-cash stock compensation, personnel costs, market research costs and professional fees. Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $10.4 million, or $1.03 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.22 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAbout Avenue Therapeutics\nAvenue Therapeutics, Inc.
