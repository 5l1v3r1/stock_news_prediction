These require the bulk grain handler to pay for transportation of a fixed amount of grain or pay a financial penalty.\nThe poor start has weighed on GrainCorp shares, which have lost about 12 percent so far in May, and hit a near three-month low on Friday.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of 8 Australian cents per share, down from 15 cents last year.\n$1 = 1.3278 Australian dollars Reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; additional reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:59:51.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
