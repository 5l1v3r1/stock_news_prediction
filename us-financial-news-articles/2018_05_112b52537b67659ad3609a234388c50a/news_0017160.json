The first hearing of the Supreme Court is on June 15.\n“The Kolwezi Court concluded today that the previously scheduled Capital Deficiency Proceedings should be suspended until after the Supreme Court renders its decision,” Glencore said in a statement.\n(This story corrects headline to show suspension came from local court not Supreme Court)\nReporting by Zandi Shabalala and Julia Payne; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T02:50:08.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
