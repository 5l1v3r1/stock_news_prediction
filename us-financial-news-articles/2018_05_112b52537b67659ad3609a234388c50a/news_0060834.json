REUTERS/Beawiharta/File Photo Perry Warjiyo, sworn in as governor last week, said on Monday it was not an \"emergency meeting\", but the rupiah IDR= jumped to a two-week high on hopes central bank actions will relieve persistent pressure on the country's financial markets.\nAlongside other emerging markets, Indonesia has seen an outflow of funds as U.S. assets become more attractive due to rising interest rates.\nBank Indonesia on May 17 raised its benchmark interest rate IDCBRR=ECI for the first time since November 2014 in a bid to bolster the fragile rupiah and stem capital outflows. On Friday, it said it will hold an additional meeting on May 30 to discuss economic and monetary conditions.\n“The dynamics offshore happen so quickly and market perceptions are formed quickly that there is a tendency that some became irrational,” Warjiyo told a briefing attended by other policymakers.\n“These dynamics need to be responded to immediately to stabilize things.”\nHe said Wednesday’s meeting will look ahead to the Federal Reserve’s June policy review, which is expected to raise U.S. rates again.\nRelated Coverage Indonesia central bank's extra policy meeting to look ahead to Fed's June review - governor BI’s next scheduled meeting is June 27-28, after the Eid al-Fitr holidays following the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. This period is also a time of peak spending in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country, adding to pressure on policymakers to maintain stability.\nAt Monday’s news conference, Darmin Nasution, the coordinating minister of economics, said regulators will prioritize stability in the short-term and economic growth in the medium-term.\n“We are not in a crisis. These are to strengthen things, to respond to dynamics,” said Nasution.\nOther Indonesian markets also rallied on Monday, with the benchmark 10-year government bond yield ID10YT=RR falling to 7.223 percent at noon from 7.545 percent on Friday. Jakarta's main stock index .JKSE rose 1.3 percent.\nSlideshow (2 Images) THE 2013 VOLATILITY Last week, Warjiyo promised to use interest rate policy to stabilize the rupiah in the near-term and to be “more pre-emptive” and ahead of the curve on monetary settings.\nThe rupiah has been among the worst performers among Asian currencies this year, losing about 3 percent of its value, as investors slash their holdings in emerging markets in response to rising U.S. Treasury yields.\nDBS said that weaker sentiment on emerging market debt had pushed several central banks including Argentina and Turkey to take a more hawkish stance to control capital outflow risks and maintain financial markets stability.\n“Against this backdrop, further BI rate hikes may be needed, with the next one possibly as early as this week,” it said.\nEconomists at Citi, Morgan Stanley, Bank Danamon and Trimegah Securities also predicted a rate rise, while Natixis said it expected the central bank to be guided by a 2013 precedent and take decisive moves.\nThe last time BI held an extraordinary meeting was the November 2014 one that raised its main policy rate, to tackle rising inflation expectations.\n“Indonesia faces the possibility of having to bring down its current account deficit at the expense of GDP growth, as in 2013,” Citi economist Helmi Arman said in a note.\nWhen Indonesia last faced such market volatility in 2013, during the so-called “taper tantrum”, policymakers took a series of measures to restore calm.\nThese included BI raising rates by 175 basis points, allowing the exchange rate to depreciate and preparing bilateral swap agreements, while the government let in more imports to maintain domestic prices.\nPolicymakers have already repeated some of these measures.Warjiyo said the “dual intervention” that BI is currently doing in the currency and bond markets is similar to 2013.\nBI has also announced an intention to broaden swap agreements with Japan to bolster its “second line of defense”.\nMeanwhile, the government has allowed more food imports to keep prices low and cap energy prices with larger subsidies. Officials are also working on improving tax incentives to attract investment.\nFOREX RESERVES Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government would improve debt management and governance of state firms, especially those working on infrastructure.\nMany state firms dominating large swathes of the economy have seen debt levels balloon.\nHowever, officials say the economy is now in a much better condition compared to 2013, with larger foreign-exchange reserves, greater fiscal space and a smaller current account deficit.\n“We are ready to take any kind of policy to support Indonesia’s economy,” Indrawati said, adding that if short-term measures mean slightly lower growth, “then that consequence has to be accepted”.\nAdditional reporting by Gayatri Suroyo and Fransiska Nangoy; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:36:25.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
