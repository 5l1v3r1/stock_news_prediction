Hammel was pummeled for nine runs on six hits, including three home runs, in 3 2/3 innings; Bauer surrendered five runs (four of them earned) on 11 hits and two walks with three strikeouts over 4 2/3 innings.\nBrad Keller (1-1), the fourth of five Kansas City pitchers, earned the win with three shutout innings, allowing two hits and a walk. Kelvin Herrera hurled a perfect ninth for his eighth save of the year.\nMiller (1-1) took the loss for Cleveland, after allowing two runs on one hit in two-thirds of an inning.\nJose Ramirez hit a two-run home run in the first, and two batters later, Yonder Alonso hit a solo shot that staked the Indians to a 3-0 lead.\nKansas City answered in the top of the second with an RBI single by Alcides Escobar and a two-run double from Jon Jay to tie the game. The Royals took the lead in the third on a bases-loaded walk to Escobar that pushed across Perez.\nCleveland seemed to take charge in a six-run fourth inning that was highlighted by Tyler Naquin’s two-run double and Michael Brantley’s grand slam, giving the Indians a 9-4 lead.\nBut the Royals roared back again, scoring on Escobar’s groundout in the fifth, and in the sixth, getting run-scoring doubles by Mike Moustakas and Lucas Duda. Escobar later added an RBI single to get to within 9-8.\nPerez then put Kansas City back in front 10-9 on his two-run home run.\nThe series continues on Saturday afternoon with right-hander Jakob Junis (4-2, 3.18 ERA) taking the mound for the Royals to oppose Cleveland right-hander Mike Clevinger (2-0, 2.76).\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-12T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:22:58.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
