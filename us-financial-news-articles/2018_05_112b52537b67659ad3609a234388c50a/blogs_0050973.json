For the past four years, Deere has been struggling against weaker demand for farm equipment as global oversupplies kept a lid on prices.\n\"Given the recovery ongoing in 2018 and management's expectation that operating cash flow will grow 56 percent year over year, we think it is very likely that Deere could raise its dividend and continue to buy back shares,\" Fisher said.\nThe expectation of shareholder-friendly activity prompted Fisher to increase his 12-month price target on Deere's stock to $185 from $175, implying 18 percent upside over the next year.\nShares of the Moline, Illinois-based company are largely unchanged since January, though they're up more than 13 percent in the past month and are 2 percent higher in early trading Thursday.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T15:28:15.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
