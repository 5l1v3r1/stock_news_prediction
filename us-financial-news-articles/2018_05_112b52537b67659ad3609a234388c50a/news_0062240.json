Heavyweight Dubai Islamic Bank was down 0.2 percent, as shares continued to slip while trading in a rights issue, which started in mid-May and will end on May 30.\nBuilding contractor Drake & Scull International was 0.8 percent lower, after making significant gains following positive first quarter results.\nThe company made a net profit of 7.3 million dirhams ($2 million) in the first quarter of this year, against an 838.8 million loss in the first quarter of 2017. However, in a note published earlier this week, research firm AlphaMena said a sustainable recovery in the stock looked unlikely, “since the contractor is still facing liquidity issues and needs to improve its business efficiency.”\nOutside of Dubai, Gulf markets were little changed. The Saudi index was up 0.1 percent with Alinma Bank , the second most-traded stock, 0.3 percent higher.\nReal estate developer Dar Al Arkan attracted the highest volume in the first hour of trading, and was down 0.6 percent.\nThe Qatar index was up 0.7 percent at 9,187 points. It was heading towards its next resistance level at 9,200 after breaking away from recent resistance at 9,000, a QNB research note said.
