The prime minister’s office has said that cobalt will be designated a strategic substance and copper could be too.\nTime is running out to negotiate as the deadline for the new regulations to be signed into law is within 90 days of President Joseph Kabila signing the code on March 9.\nA spokeswoman for Randgold, which is representing seven of the largest foreign miners in Congo, said she could not comment and that negotiations continued.
