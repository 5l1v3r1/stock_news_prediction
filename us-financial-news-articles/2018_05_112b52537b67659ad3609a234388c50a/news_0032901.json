(NASDAQ: EAST), a producer of craft spirits, reported first quarter 2018 financial results.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights:\nGross sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were of $1,413,182, an increase of 70% compared to $829,669 in the first quarter of 2017, led by the launch of Redneck Riviera Whiskey, sales from our private label and wine canning operations, as well as resumption of growth within the Pacific Northwest of our rebranded Burnside lineup. Total shipments increased to 8,305 cases during Q1 2018 from 5,937 cases in Q1 2017, an increase of 40%. Branded product shipments increased 80% over last year. Initial shipments of Redneck Riviera Whiskey, which first hit store shelves in February 2018, exceeded expectations, with 2,800 9L cases shipped. Gross margins improved to 49% during Q1 2018 compared to 37% during fiscal 2017.\nKey Operational Highlights from Q1 2018:\nRedneck Riviera Whiskey, a collaboration with country music superstar John Rich, launched in January 2018, with first product hitting the shelf in February 2018. Eastside began to benefit from the December 2017 tax legislation, which went into effect January 1 of 2018. Strengthened the management team with the addition of Tom Wood as VP of Production, Robert Manfredonia as VP of National Accounts, and Kim Davis as Controller. Introduced Hue-Hue Coffee Rum, the next Sandstrom rebranded product in our lineup. Launched our new “slim line” canning capability during the quarter, with initial shipments to customers in the canned wine segment during the first quarter.\nRedneck Riviera Whiskey Launch Highlights Since January 2018:\nSigned distribution agreements with the Southeast’s largest spirit distributors, Republic National Distributing Company (“RNDC”), to distribute Redneck Riviera Whiskey throughout the Gulf Coast, upper Midwest and began distribution in California with Southern Glazer Wine and Spirits. Redneck Riviera Whiskey is currently distributed in 15 states, including Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, California, North Carolina, North and South Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Kentucky. Strong promotional support has been provided for Redneck Riviera Whiskey since its launch, with John Rich making appearances on national TV shows, including Today Show with Megyn Kelly ; local TV shows, including NBC , ABC and Fox affiliates; in-store appearances to support retailers; performances at numerous events, including the ROTH Capital Partners 2018 Conference ; participation in the Nasdaq Closing Bell ceremony ; as well as distributor and customer events . Significant retailer adoption, including authorization by Walmart in Florida, Louisiana and California; the largest liquor retailer in Texas, Spec’s ; as well as one of the largest independent supermarkets in the Gulf Coast, Rouses .\nManagement Commentary\nGrover Wickersham, Chairman and CEO of Eastside Distilling, commented, “Our first quarter 2018 results are the early returns on the investments EAST made in 2017 to position us as a leader in the emerging craft spirits industry. The sales growth of 70% was achieved with two months of Redneck Riviera shipments and two weeks of wine canning operations during the quarter. The Sandstrom rebranding of our Burnside Bourbon, which re-launched at the end of last year, has resulted in a resumption of growth in that key product line. March sales of the Burnside line in the Pacific Northwest surpassed the peak level reached in 2017. We believe that momentum in our key brands, our pipeline of innovative new products and our canning operations, as well as other of our strategic initiatives, will produce continued strong growth throughout the remainder of 2018 and well into 2019.”\nFinancial Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Eastside Distilling reported record gross sales of $1,413,182, an increase of 70% compared to $829,669 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in sales is primarily attributable to: the newly launched Redneck Riviera Whiskey product, increased wholesale sales traction within the Pacific Northwest (which was offset by lower sales nationally due to our Burnside product transition), our acquisitions of MotherLode and BBD and related expansion of our private label business and canning abilities, and the addition of new retail locations.\nTotal shipments increased to 8,305 cases during Q1 2018 (6,877 for branded products and 1,428 for private label which now includes wine canning) from 5,937 cases in Q1 2017, an increase of 40% overall and 80% in branded products.\nGross profit margins (as a percent of Net Sales) were 49% during Q1 2018 compared to 47% during Q1 2017 and approximately 37% overall in fiscal 2017. The improvement in gross profit margins is primarily due to the combination of our new products which have higher margins than prior legacy products as well as the new, lower federal excise tax. While our goal is to ultimately improve our overall gross margin further, we expect it to fluctuate around the current level in the short term due to the impact of product sales mix and the related customer programs and incentive programs that are subject to fluctuation and are especially large in the early phases of new product launches such as Redneck Riviera and rebranded Burnside. Under our contract with Mark Rich, half of reimbursable marketing expense, as defined in the contract, is returned to us upon sale of the Redneck Riviera Whiskey brand, should a sale occur.\nAdvertising, promotional and selling expenses during Q1 2018 improved as a percent of sales to 45.5% of sales compared to 46.5% during Q1 2017. General and administrative expenses increased slightly as a percent of sales primarily due to increased headcount to support the Redneck Riviera and wine canning launches, as well as higher stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA during Q1 2018 was $(780,357), which compared to $(564,494) in Q1 2017 and $(930,472) in Q4 2017.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders was $(1,318,524), or $(0.27) per basic and diluted share for Q1 2018, compared $(906,855), or $(0.35) per basic and diluted share in the year ago period.\nThe company ended the quarter with $1.6 million in cash and inventories of $5.3 million. The inventory balance was an increase of $1.3 million compared to the year end as the company purchased bulk spirits to meet the anticipated demand of its newly launched Redneck Riviera Whiskey. Subsequent to the end of the year, the Company also raised approximately $1.7 million through the issuance of notes and early redemption of previously issued public warrants.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today to discuss these results.\nDate and Time : 11:30 am ET (8:30 am PT) on Monday, May 14, 2018\nCall-in Information : Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (844) 889-4332 or (412) 717-9595.\nLive Webcast Information : Interested parties can access the conference call via a live Internet webcast, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at https://www.eastsidedistilling.com/investors/ .\nTo Ask a Question : The conference call will be moderated by Lytham Partners, an investor relations firm.
