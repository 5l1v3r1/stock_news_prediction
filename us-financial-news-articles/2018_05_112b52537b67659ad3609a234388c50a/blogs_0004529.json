The internet giant is sponsoring a horse in Saturday's Kentucky Derby .\nThe reason? The horse's name is Audible. Just like the audiobook company Amazon owns.\n\"We started seeing Audible pop up in news feeds in February,\" said the book company's marketing chief John Harrobin. \"And we noticed, 'Wait, this isn't us.'\"\nIntrigued, Harrobin called WinStar Farms, where Audible trains, and spoke with the owner about a possible partnership. At first, it began as a charity agreement. Amazon donated $15,000 to the nonprofit organization Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance in return for some promotional rights.\nHarrobin says when he called, the main owner of the farm didn't even know about Audible Books. He says Audible was named after the football play, \"calling the option.\"\nThe 3-year-old horse, trained by Todd Pletcher, has finished first in his last four races. But it was the Florida Derby at the end of March that sealed the deal and meant Audible was getting marquee exposure — the Kentucky Derby.\nAmazon decided this was too good of a story to pass up. It called WinStar Farms and made it official.\nCurrently one of the frontrunners , with 8-1 odds to win the Run for the Roses, the horse and his jockey will now be dressed in Amazon's Audible signage.\n\"We thought this could be a good story and our listeners love a good story,\" said Harrobin.\nInternally, it's been dubbed \"Project Neigh,\" and Amazon is having a blast with it. It has created social media and marketing campaigns around the horse and even scheduled a company-wide happy hour with a Kentucky Derby theme.\nThe company has launched an interactive game, asking players to guess whether it's an Audible book or a racehorse, and has built a special section on its website dedicated to horse-related audiobooks.\n\"We thought this could be a cultural moment that we can be a part of,\" Harrobin said.\nIf this once-dark horse goes on to win it big, Audible says they will give away Joe Drape's New York Times best-seller \"American Pharoah\" for free.", "external_links": ["https://www.audible.com/ep/go-audible", "https://www.kentuckyderby.com/wager/expert-picks", "http://www.thoroughbredaftercare.org/", "https://www.kentuckyderby.com/"], "published": "2018-05-02T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T16:07:17.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
