Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization came in at 300.5 million reais, up 30 percent from the same period last year.\nThose estimates appeared to beat the market's already lofty expectations. Analysts at BTG Pactual and Itaú BBA had both projected first quarter net profit of around 120 million reais.\nThe company's e-commerce operation drove growth, expanding 65 percent in yearly terms. Sales through its mobile application picked up pace, while the company's marketplace format, which allows third party vendors to sell online via Magazine Luiza platforms, also grew rapidly.\nMagazine Luiza's strong performance in recent quarters - as well as that of tech-savvy competitors like Via Varejo SA and B2W Cia Digital SA - illustrates how some Brazilian retailers are successfully capturing the country's growing e-commerce market as the economy recovers from a years-long recession.\nThat could make life difficult for international companies like Amazon.com Inc and Mercadolibre Inc as they expand operations in Latin America's largest economy.\nIn the second quarter, Magazine Luiza said it plans to open 30 new stores, mainly in regions where it has little or no presence, such as Sao Luis in the nation's relatively impoverished north.\nIt has recently acquired a logistics start-up called Logbee, which it said would aid its distribution operations beyond metropolitan Sao Paulo.\nMagazine Luiza also said that it had launched the biggest television sale in the company's history during the first quarter, allowing customers to partially pay for new televisions by trading in their old sets. Ahead of the soccer World Cup in June and July, sales of televisions have picked up pace significantly in Brazil.\n($1 = 3.55 reais) (Reporting by Gram Slattery Editing by Leslie Adler and Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T08:55:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
