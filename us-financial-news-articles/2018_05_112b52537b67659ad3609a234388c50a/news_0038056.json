But the same website said on Tuesday he had changed his mind and would go to be part of history.\nTMZ later Quote: d him as saying the trip was off due to his need for immediate heart surgery.\nMarkle, who lives in Mexico, had been due to walk his daughter down the aisle on Saturday at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle in front of 600 guests including all the senior British royals and a smattering of celebrities.\nBritain’s Sun newspaper, the country’s best selling, had to scramble to update its front page to reflect what it called the “Royal Sensation” of Thomas Markle’s absence under the headline: “I’ve got heart op today”. It offered four pages of analysis.\nHEARTBREAKING “It must be heartbreaking for them, because her father can’t come because he is in poor health,” said 46-year-old Maria Scott who had traveled from Newcastle to camp out in Windsor to get a glimpse of the couple on Saturday.\n“It must be really upsetting but I’m sure her mum will do a fine job,” Scott told Reuters.\nHarry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth and sixth-in-line to the throne, and Markle, a star in U.S. TV drama “Suits”, will tie the knot at Windsor Castle, home to the British royal family for nearly 1,000 years.\nOn Windsor’s streets, hundreds of tourists and journalists mingled with dedicated royals fans - some draped with UK flags and holding photographs of Harry and Markle - while armed police patrolled.\nSome fans are sleeping out on the street until the wedding, seeking to secure the best positions to see the couple.\nA Union Flag decorated with images of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle hangs from a building outside Windsor Castle ahead of their wedding, in Windsor, Britain May 16, 2018.

Kensington Palace declined to comment on Wednesday.\nThe bride-to-be’s parents are divorced and while Harry has been pictured with her mother Doria Ragland, 61, there had been speculation about the relationship with Thomas Markle, a former lighting director for TV soaps and sitcoms.\nThousands of journalists are descending on Windsor, and Thomas Markle told TMZ earlier this week that the media attention had taken its toll.\nHe said he had been offered up to $100,000 for interviews and been ambushed by paparazzi whose snaps had shown him buying beer and looking disheveled.\nTMZ said he had agreed to the staged pictures, which showed him looking at images of the couple on a computer and being sized up for a suit, because he hoped they would improve his image.\nSlideshow (3 Images) In response to the initial reports on Monday, Kensington Palace said it was “a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle”, asking for respect and understanding for her father.\nWriting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
