CFO Sérgio Malacrida said in an interview with Reuters the group is still aiming for net debt of less than 2 times its EBITDA by the end of this year, excluding proceeds from the sale of Fibria.\n“Leverage will fall more steeply in the coming quarters of 2018,” said Malacrida. He said Votorantim does not plan to take out new loans this year, except to pay outstanding debts.\n$1 = 3.59 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T00:32:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
