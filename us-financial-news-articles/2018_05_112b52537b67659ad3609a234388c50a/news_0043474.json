President Sergio Mattarella sought further consultations over their proposed prime minister, a political novice.\nSome investors were doubtful a coalition government would be able to go ahead with big spending plans that have spooked markets, sending Italian bond yields to their highest in more than a year.\n“I don’t know how long this coalition will last. There’s an awful lot of negativity around it but I would be surprised if the coalition can go any meaningful distance,” said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth.\n“Certainly Italy is a problem but geopolitical tension seems actually lower now than I can remember in a long time,” he added.\nFrench telecoms stocks were also key players during the session after the head of the country’s telecoms regulator reignited talk of possible mergers in the sector, in comments to Le Monde newspaper.\nBouygues, Orange and Iliad rose 4.1 percent, 4.5 percent and 7.3 percent respectively.\nShares of SFR’s parent company Altice surged 19.2 percent but the move also reflected a technical adjustment of their price following the separation of Altice NV from Altice USA.
