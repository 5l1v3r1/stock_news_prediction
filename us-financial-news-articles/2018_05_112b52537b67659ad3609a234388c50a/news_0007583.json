REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\nThe company’s total gross dollar volume rose more than 19 percent to about $1.42 trillion in the first quarter, of which about 30 percent were transactions processed in the United States.\nU.S. consumer spending got a boost from rising wages, which hit their highest levels in 11 years, as companies passed on gains from tax cuts to their employees and job market improved.\nBigger rival Visa also posted a quarterly profit well above analysts’ estimates last week.\nBoth Mastercard and Visa continued to reap the benefits of consumers using their cards for offshore spending.\nMastercard’s cross-border volumes, or transactions made by overseas cardholders, rose 31.8 percent in the quarter when converted to dollars.\n“Mastercard’s quarter exceeded expectations as the company rides the wave of a strong global consumer,” said Gil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson.\nThe Purchase, New York-based company also raised its 2018 growth forecast for adjusted net revenue to high-teens from mid-teens and adjusted operating expenses to mid-teens from low-double digits.\nNet income rose to $1.49 billion, or $1.41 per share, in the latest quarter ended March 31 from $1.08 billion, or $1 per share, a year earlier.
