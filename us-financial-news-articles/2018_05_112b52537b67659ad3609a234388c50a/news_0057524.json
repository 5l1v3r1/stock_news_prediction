It is also the second fintech company this week after payments processor EVO Payments Inc to see its IPO priced at the upper end of the expected range.\nWhile many technology-driven online lenders such as LendingClub Corp and OnDeck Capital Inc have struggled to grow their loan portfolios, weighed down by concerns over underwriting standards and access to funding, GreenSky avoids these perils by being a conduit to banks and other specialty lenders.\nThe company had 1.7 million customers as of March 31, and has helped finance over $12 billion in loans with its bank partners which include SunTrust Banks Inc, Regions Financial Corp, Fifth Third Bancorp and Synovus Financial Corp.\nGreenSky provides its services at the point of sale, which helps attract more customers and increase sales volume. It counts Home Depot Inc as its biggest merchant.\nIn 2016, the company began expanding into elective healthcare to target creditworthy consumers who make large purchases. Elective healthcare includes clinics providing cosmetic and aesthetic surgeries, reproductive medicine, dentistry and veterinary medicine.\nGreenSky's 2017 revenue jumped 23.5 percent year-over-year to $325.9 million, while profit rose 11.4 percent to $138.7 million as transaction volumes surged 31 percent.\nFollowing the IPO, Zalik will hold 47.68 percent of voting power at the company, GreenSky said in its IPO filing https://bit.ly/2J5J49Q .\nGoldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are among the main underwriting banks on GreenSky's IPO.
