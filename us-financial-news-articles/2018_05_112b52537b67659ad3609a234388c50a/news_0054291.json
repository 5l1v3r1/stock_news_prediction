The reality is the talks are still continuing as they haven’t made headway on various issues, including intellectual properties,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\nFurther weighing on prices of risk assets, Trump also said there was a “substantial chance” his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons.\nThe cautious mood helped to underpin bonds. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.063 percent, off Monday’s near seven-year high of 3.128 percent.\nAs lower U.S. yields sap the appetite for the dollar, the euro traded at $1.1782, hovering above Monday’s five-month low of $1.1717.\nAgainst the yen the dollar slipped to 110.81 from Monday’s four-month high of 111.395.\nThe biggest mover in the currency market was the Turkish lira, which fell almost two percent early on Wednesday to a record low after rating agencies sounded the alarm on Tuesday about plans by President Tayyip Erdogan to tighten his grip on monetary policy.\nThe lira has fallen almost 15 percent so far this month.\nIn commodities, oil prices held firm near 3-1/2-year highs on potential supply concerns surrounding Venezuela and Iran.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded little changed at $72.22 a barrel, a 0.15 percent loss. They touched $72.83 a barrel, the highest since November 2014, on Tuesday.\nBrent futures stood at $79.56 a barrel. Last week, the global benchmark topped $80 for the first time since November 2014.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:08:40.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
