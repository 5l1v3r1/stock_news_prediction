The decline was offset by a C$11.3 billion purchase of private corporate bonds.\nAt the same time, Canadian investors reduced their holdings of foreign securities by C$1.9 billion, the first divestment in four months.\nCanadians sold C$10.5 billion in foreign shares, including U.S. and non-U.S. foreign shares. U.S. stock prices were down 2.7 percent in March, the statistics agency said.\nBut Canadians bought C$7.1 billion in foreign bonds. The differential between U.S. and Canadian long- and short-term rates widened in March to favor U.S. investments, the report said.
