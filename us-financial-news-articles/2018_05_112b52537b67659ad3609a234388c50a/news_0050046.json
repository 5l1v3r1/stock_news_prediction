REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\nThe pressure on Supra Mahumapelo is evidence of Ramaphosa’s drive to root out graft since he replaced former president Jacob Zuma in February. Ramaphosa met Mahumapelo, who is an ally of Zuma, to try to persuade him to step down.\nProtesters took to the streets of the province’s capital Mahikeng in April demanding Mahumapelo’s resignation and accusing him of mishandling state tenders and overseeing the collapse of the local health system.\nMahumapelo initially refused to step down, saying he was being unfairly targeted for supporting Zuma’s ex-wife in the closely fought race for leader of the African National Congress (ANC) won by Ramaphosa in December.\nThe length of the tussle over Mahumapelo’s tenure shows Ramaphosa’s cautious leadership style and the power that Zuma loyalists retain within the ANC, which is Africa’s oldest liberation movement.\nMahumapelo denies wrongdoing and said he yielded to pressure to resign to dispel fears that he could influence dozens of investigations into mismanagement in the province.\n“I think it will be better for one to go on early retirement,” Mahumapelo told a news conference at the ANC’s headquarters in downtown Johannesburg.\nHe has led North West since 2014 and defended his record on the region’s economy, which he said was growing at over 2 percent. He accused “counter-revolutionaries” of stirring up public anger against his rule.\nANC Secretary General Ace Magashule, one of the party’s top six most powerful officials who is also seen as being close to Zuma, told the same news conference that the ruling party supported Mahumapelo’s resignation.\nRamaphosa placed the North West under central government control earlier this month and deployed army medics to hospitals to treat patients after cutting short a visit to a Commonwealth summit in Britain to travel to the province.\nPolice last month fired tear gas at protesters who blocked roads, set alight cars and looted shops in and around Mahikeng.\nJessie Duarte, ANC Deputy Secretary General, said the national government would remain in control of the North West while it got to the bottom of the problems there.\nShe said the ANC was united behind Ramaphosa and dismissed talk of a lingering struggle for control of the party between rival factions.\n“We have to move forward,” Duarte said. “For the next five years this is the leadership of the ANC led by President Cyril Ramaphosa.” Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:45:09.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
