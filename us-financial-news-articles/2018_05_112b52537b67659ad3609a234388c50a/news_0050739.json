He’s currently in a KGB detention center,” he said. “He has no complaints about the conditions.”\nSharoyko had reportedly pleaded guilty, but the embassy does not believe the reports, Kizim said.\nNeither the KGB nor the courts could be reached for comment.\nBelarus has been run on Soviet-style command lines by President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994 and has been criticized by the West for human rights abuses and its treatment of the political opposition.\nThe Sharoyko case has not had a noticeable effect on Ukraine-Belarus relations, which came under strain last year when Belarus hosted large-scale joint military exercises with Russia on Belarussian territory.\nWriting by Alessandra Prentice; Editing by Matthias Williams and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:26:23.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
