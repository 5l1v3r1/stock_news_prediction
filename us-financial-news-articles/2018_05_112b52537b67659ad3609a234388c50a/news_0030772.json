Shi’ite Hezbollah is fighting in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad.\nIn a televised speech Nasrallah said the rocket attack showed Syria and its allies are ready to go to “the greatest extent” to defend Syria from Israel. He did not say who had carried out the attack.\nNasrallah said 55 missiles were launched from Syrian territory in the attack. Israel had said 20 missiles were shot down by its Iron Dome defence system in the attack on Thursday.
