It said the Alabama plant will reopen next week on a \"modified production schedule\" while the automaker works with Meridian to restore parts production.\nFord's Louisville truck plant, which builds F-series Super Duty pickups, remains closed indefinitely.\nFord executives earlier this week said the company's quarterly earnings could be affected by shutdowns at the three truck plants, but affirmed its full-year earnings estimate.\nFord said it was working with Chinese-owned Meridian to shift production of the affected parts to other suppliers until the fire-damaged plant can be repaired and production resumed.\nFord shares were down slightly in after-hours trade, at $11.19.
