The same store contribution (NOI) growth was primarily driven by favorable customer mix, increase in number of fixed commitment contracts, and productivity improvements across our network. We continue to make progress within our development pipeline as we work to support our customers and market growth opportunities. In the first quarter 2018, we completed our initial public offering and simultaneously closed on our $925.0 million dollar credit facility. As the first publicly traded REIT in the temperature-controlled infrastructure and supply chain industry, we believe we are well positioned for continued growth and creating long-term shareholder value” stated Fred Boehler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Americold Realty Trust.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenue was $391.1 million, a 4.9% increase over the same quarter last year; Global Warehouse segment revenue was $286.5 million, a 3.9% increase over the same quarter last year Total contribution (NOI) was $97.3 million, a 7.0% increase over the same quarter last year; Global Warehouse segment contribution (NOI) was $89.6 million, a 7.2% increase over the same quarter last year Net loss of $8.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $4.4 million from the same quarter last year; excluding $21.1 million of non-cash deferred financing costs, net income for the quarter would have been $12.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share Core EBITDA of $71.7 million, a 6.5% increase over the same quarter last year Core Funds from Operations (\"Core FFO\") of $34.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”) of $39.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share Global Warehouse segment same store revenue grew 4.0% to $280.5 million, with segment contribution (NOI) improving 6.5% to $89.1 million, both over prior year Completed initial public offering (\"IPO\") in January 2018, generating net proceeds of $494 million to the Company Closed $925 million senior secured credit facility\nFirst Quarter 2018 Total Company Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $391.1 million, a 4.9% increase from the same quarter of the prior year. This growth was largely driven by a more favorable customer mix, a shift to a greater number of fixed commitment storage contracts, and contractual rate escalations within the Global Warehouse segment.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $8.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the write-off of $21.1 million of non-cash deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of debt in conjunction with the Company's January 2018 initial public offering (\"IPO\"). Excluding this charge, net income for the quarter would have been $12.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share.\nTotal contribution (NOI) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 7.0% to $97.3 million, compared to $91.0 million for the same quarter of the prior year.\nCore EBITDA was $71.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $67.3 million for the same quarter of the prior year. This reflects a 6.5% increase over prior year while absorbing approximately $1.5 million of additional recurring public company expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Core FFO was $34.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $22.7 million for same quarter of the prior year.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, AFFO was $39.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $26.8 million for same quarter of the prior year. AFFO excludes certain expenses and income items that do not represent core expenses and income streams.\nPlease see the Company's supplemental financial information for the definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAs a result of the Company going public subsequent to January 1, 2018, the weighted average share count used to derive the first quarter 2018 per share metrics reflects the timing of the offering.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Global Warehouse Segment Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Global Warehouse segment revenues were $286.5 million, an increase of $10.7 million, or 3.9%, compared to $275.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. This growth was primarily driven by a more favorable customer mix, a shift to a greater number of fixed commitment storage contracts, and contractual rate escalations.\nWarehouse segment contribution (NOI) was $89.6 million, or 31.3% of segment revenue for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $83.5 million, or 30.3% of revenue, for the prior year. This represents 7.2% improvement in segment profitability over the first quarter 2017 and an expansion of 100 basis points in segment margin period-over-period. The year over year profit growth was driven primarily by a more favorable customer mix, a shift to a greater number of fixed commitment storage contracts, and labor and other productivity improvements. The Company continues to generate productivity improvements with its ongoing focus on continuous improvement initiatives driven by further adoption of its Americold Operating System (\"AOS\").\nThe Company ended the first quarter of 2018 with 146 total facilities in its Global Warehouse segment portfolio. Of the 146 total facilities, 138 meet the Company’s definition of facilities with at least 24 months of consecutive \"normalized operations\" and are reported as \"same store.\" The remaining eight facilities are in various stages of operations and are classified as \"non-same store.\"\nThe tables below summarize the first quarter 2018 Global Warehouse full segment and same store metrics compared to the same period a year ago:\nGlobal Warehouse - Total Three Months Ended March 31, Change Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 Global Warehouse revenues: Rent and storage $ 125,727 $ 119,666 5.1 % Warehouse services 160,790 156,141 3.0 % Total Warehouse revenues 286,517 275,807 3.9 % Global Warehouse contribution (NOI) $ 89,570 $ 83,520 7.2 % Global Warehouse margin 31.3 % 30.3 % 100 bps Units in thousands except per pallet data Global Warehouse rent and storage: Occupancy Average occupied pallets 2,447 2,469 (0.9 )% Average physical pallet positions 3,212 3,184 0.9 % Occupancy percentage 76.2 % 77.6 % -140 bps Same store rent and storage revenues per occupied pallet $ 51.38 $ 48.47 6.0 % Global Warehouse services: Throughput pallets 6,645 6,799 (2.3 )% Same store warehouse services revenues per throughput pallet $ 24.20 $ 22.97 5.4 % Global Warehouse - Same Store Three Months Ended March 31, Change Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 Global Warehouse same store revenues: Rent and storage $ 122,977 $ 116,661 5.4 %\nWarehouse services 157,502 152,999 2.9 % Total same store revenues 280,479 269,660 4.0 % Global Warehouse same store contribution (NOI) $ 89,126 $ 83,706 6.5 % Global Warehouse same store margin 31.8 % 31.0 % 80 bps Units in thousands except per pallet data Global Warehouse same store rent and storage: Occupancy Average occupied pallets 2,375 2,416 (1.7 )% Average physical pallet positions 3,112 3,096 0.5 % Occupancy percentage 76.3 % 78.0 % -170 bps Same store rent and storage revenues per occupied pallet $ 51.77 $ 48.30 7.2 % Global Warehouse same store services: Throughput pallets 6,499 6,657 (2.4 )% Same store warehouse services revenues per throughput pallet $ 24.24 $ 22.98 5.5 % Fixed Commitment Rent and Storage Revenue\nAnnualized committed rent and storage revenue was $197.7 million, which represented 38.9% of total Warehouse segment rent and storage revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nCapital and Balance Sheet Activity\nIn January 2018, the Company completed its IPO and issued 33.4 million common shares at $16.00 per share, including the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, raising aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $494.0 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. In connection with the IPO, the Company closed on its new $925.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a five-year, $525.0 million senior secured term loan A facility and a three-year, $400.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. Subsequently, the Company used the proceeds to repay its term loan B facility and outstanding construction loan debt aggregating $827.5 million and repaid $50 million of its outstanding term loan A facility while increasing its revolver capacity by $50 million.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total liquidity of approximately $610.0 million, including cash and capacity on its revolving credit facility.

Our core business is our warehouse segment, where we provide temperature-controlled warehouse storage and related handling and other warehouse services. In our warehouse segment, we collect rent and storage fees from customers to store their frozen and perishable food and other products within our real estate portfolio. We also provide our customers with handling and other warehouse services related to the products stored in our buildings that are designed to optimize their movement through the cold chain, such as the placement of food products for storage and preservation, the retrieval of products from storage upon customer request, blast freezing, case-picking, kitting and repackaging and other recurring handling services.\nUnder our third-party managed segment, we manage warehouses on behalf of third parties and provide warehouse management services to several leading food retailers and manufacturers in customer-owned facilities, including some of our largest and longest-standing customers. We believe using our third-party management services allows our customers to increase efficiency, reduce costs, reduce supply-chain risks and focus on their core businesses. We also believe that providing third-party management services to many of our key customers underscores our ability to offer a complete and integrated suite of services across the cold chain.\nIn our transportation segment, we broker and manage transportation of frozen and perishable food and other products for our customers. Our transportation services include consolidation services (i.e., consolidating a customer’s products with those of other customers for more efficient shipment), freight under management services (i.e., arranging for and overseeing transportation of customer inventory) and dedicated transportation services, each designed to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our customers. We provide these transportation services at cost plus a service fee or, in the case of our consolidation services, we charge a fixed fee.\nWe also operate a limestone quarry on the land we own around our Carthage, Missouri warehouse, which contains substantial limestone deposits. We do not view the operation of the quarry as an integral part of our business.\nNotes and Definitions\nWe calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under U.S. GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs, which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.\nWe calculate core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as FFO adjusted for the effects of gain or loss on the sale of non-real estate assets, non-offering related IPO expenses, stock-based compensation expense for the IPO retention grants, severance and reduction in workforce costs, acquisition, diligence and other pursuit costs, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, and foreign currency exchange gain or loss. We believe that Core FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core business operations. We believe Core FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods, while also providing a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential.\nHowever, because FFO and Core FFO add back real estate depreciation and amortization and do not capture the level of recurring maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, both of which have material economic impacts on our results from operations, we believe the utility of FFO and Core FFO as a measure of our performance may be limited.\nWe calculate adjusted funds from operations, or Adjusted FFO, as Core FFO adjusted for the effects of amortization of loan costs, debt discounts and above or below market leases, straight-line rent, provision or benefit from deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense from grants of stock options and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans, non-real estate depreciation, depletion or amortization (including in respect of the China JV), and recurring maintenance capital expenditures. We believe that Adjusted FFO is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in our business and to assess our ability to fund distribution requirements from our operating activities.\nFFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be evaluated along with U.S. GAAP net income and net income per diluted share (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures) in evaluating our operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities as disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered as supplements, but not alternatives, to our net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance. Moreover, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs. In addition, there is no industry definition of Core FFO or Adjusted FFO and, as a result, other REITs may also calculate Core FFO or Adjusted FFO, or other similarly-captioned metrics, in a manner different than we do. The table above reconciles FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe calculate EBITDA for Real Estate, or EBITDAre, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, defined as, earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property, including gains or losses on change of control, impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustment to reflect share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDAre is a measure commonly used in our industry, and we present EBITDAre to enhance investor understanding of our operating performance. We believe that EBITDAre provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets among otherwise comparable companies.\nWe also calculate our Core EBITDA as EBITDAre further adjusted for impairment charges on intangible and long-lived assets, gain or loss on depreciable real property asset disposals, severance and reduction in workforce costs, non-offering related IPO expenses, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency exchange gain or loss, loss on partially owned entities, and reduction in EBITDAre from partially owned entities. We believe that the presentation of Core EBITDA provides a measurement of our operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the effects of certain items that are otherwise included in EBITDAre but which we do not believe are indicative of our core business operations. EBITDAre and Core EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDAre and Core EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDAre and Core EBITDA as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculations of EBITDAre and Core EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, including:\nthese measures do not reflect our historical or future cash requirements for recurring maintenance capital expenditures or growth and expansion capital expenditures; these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; these measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; and although depreciation, depletion and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, depleted and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nWe use EBITDAre and Core EBITDA as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity. The tables on page 10 an 11 reconcile EBITDA, EBITDAre and Core EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006195/en/\nAmericold Realty Trust\nInvestor Relations\nTelephone: 678-459-1959\ninvestor.relations@americold.com\nSource: Americold Realty Trust", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006195/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americold.com&esheet=51804669&newsitemid=20180510006195&lan=en-US&anchor=www.americold.com&index=1&md5=fcf9b3f50e59d6ea3e6f37dfa66d3af9", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.americold.com&esheet=51804669&newsitemid=20180510006195&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.americold.com&index=2&md5=d7bc20e34fd45767e3c6322ca1be58d9"], "published": "2018-05-11T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:57:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
