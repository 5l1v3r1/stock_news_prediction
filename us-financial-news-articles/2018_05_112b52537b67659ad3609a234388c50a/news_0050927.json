He also criticized the administration for planning to rollback fuel economy standards, not doing more to encourage the use of ethanol and for not pushing major oil producing states.\n\"It's time for this president to stand up to OPEC,\" Schumer said of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\"He's palling around with the Saudis and the UAE and all these other oil-rich countries. Why doesn't he ask them to lower their prices?\" Schumer said, added that Trump \"should buck his oil industry buddies.\"\nA letter from Schumer and other Democrats urged Trump to send Energy Secretary Rick Perry to a June 22 OPEC meeting in Vienna to raise the oil prices issue.\nThe news conference came ahead of the busy summer driving season that starts with the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Schumer's comments.\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who chairs the Energy Committee, said she agreed \"OPECs supply restrictions are driving prices higher and should be addressed, but I was stunned to hear my colleagues encouraging more production from the likes of Iran and Saudi Arabia, rather than right here in America.\"\nThe push comes as the U.S. Transportation Department has drafted a proposal likely to be made public in early June that backs freezing vehicle emissions requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.\nOn Wednesday, California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols held separate meetings with automakers and Trump administration officials in Washington to discuss the emissions rules. Automakers have urged California and U.S. regulators to maintain nationwide fuel efficiency standards.\nSenator Tom Carper, a Democrat, said a draft of the proposal shows the administrations preferred alternative would result in Americans using 206 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 versus the current standards.
