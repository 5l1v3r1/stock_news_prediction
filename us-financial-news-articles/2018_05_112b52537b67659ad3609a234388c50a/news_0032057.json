Goodrum doubled his homer total for the season.\nJose Iglesias had two hits and a run, and John Hicks scored twice for Detroit, which has won three of its past four. The Tigers had lost their past 11 games to their division rival.\nMike Fiers (4-2) held the Indians to one run on three hits with five strikeouts in six innings.\nThe Tigers placed third baseman Jeimer Candelario on the 10-day disabled list earlier in the day due to left wrist tendinitis.

Jose Ramirez homered and scored twice for the Indians.\nCleveland center fielder Bradley Zimmer sat for the fourth straight game with a chest injury.\nRamirez put the Indians on the board in the first with his two-out homer to right, his 13th of the year.\nThe first two Tigers batters in the third reached on singles, and Pete Kozma’s one-out grounder brought home Iglesias.\nHicks led off the bottom of the fourth with a double. After a flyout, Goodrum smoked his first long ball of the game over the right-center-field wall.\nCleveland scored an unearned run against Joe Jimenez in the eighth. Ramirez reached on a Dixon Machado error with two outs, and Edwin Encarnacion brought him home with a double to right. Daniel Stumpf came in and retired Yonder Alonso on a short fly to keep the score 3-2.\nGoodrum put the game away with his second homer in the bottom of the eighth. Evan Marshall issued walks to James McCann and Hicks. Following a strikeout, Goodrum crushed a 3-2 pitch from Zach McAllister over the right field fence.\nFrancisco Lindor’s RBI single in the ninth completed the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
