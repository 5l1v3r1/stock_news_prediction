(TSX-V:BFD) (the “Corporation” or “Beaufield”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a letter of intent (“LOI”) with Bonterra Resources Inc. (“Bonterra”), whereby the Corporation has granted Bonterra an option to acquire a 70% interest (the “Option”) in 81 mineral claims totaling 3,590 hectares, located in the Urban Barry Greenstone belt, Quebec, Canada (the “Property”).\nMap1-Urban\nMap2_Rouleau\nThe Property is an assemblage of contiguous mineral claims located immediately adjacent to the boundaries of Bonterra’s Urban Barry properties containing the Gladiator Deposit and extensions. This land package also contains numerous gold showings with expansion potential including Lac Rouleau and Zone 18. The general geology is considered to be similar to that of the Gladiator area, with numerous occurrences of structurally controlled shear hosted vein mineralization on or near mafic volcanic contacts in proximity to both felsic and mafic intrusive units.\n“We believe this transaction with Bonterra represents a win-win for the shareholders of both companies. In addition to receiving the cash and share payments, Beaufield will retain a 30% interest in the project as Bonterra fulfils the $4.5 million work commitment. Bonterra, in turn, has the resources to aggressively advance the property which dovetails nicely with their existing Gladiator discovery. In addition, Beaufield will retain 100% of the northern portion of the Rouleau block, covering 3,261 hectares, which is contiguous with Osisko Mining’s Windfall project. Furthermore, Beaufield will retain 100% of the Macho, Golden Retriever and other district claims covering an additional 15,474 hectares in this emerging gold camp. We look forward to working with Bonterra as we look to unlock the value of this portion of the property,” commented Ron Stewart, President and CEO of Beaufield.
