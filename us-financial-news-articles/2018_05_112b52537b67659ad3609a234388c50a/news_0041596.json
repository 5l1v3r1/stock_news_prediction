S&P 500 e-minis were up 3 points, or 0.11 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 9.75 points, or 0.14 percent.\nInvestors have been fretting over rising interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury yield, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, holding above the key 3 percent level for the fourth day.\nHowever, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday investors pumped $11.9 billion into global equities in the past week and also put money into bank loans, likely viewing the rise in U.S. bond yields as reflecting a robustly growing economy.\nAmong stocks, Applied Materials fell 4.9 percent after the chip gear maker’s disappointing forecast renewed concerns over slowing smartphone demand, while AMD rose 2.6 percent after Cowen started coverage with an “outperform” rating.\nMattel shares gained 3.7 percent on a Wall Street Journal report that the company rejected Bratz dolls inventor Isaac Larian’s offer to merge his MGA Entertainment Inc with the Barbie doll maker.
