(OTCQB:MRIC) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenue decreased 19% to $1.6 million for the first quarter 2018, from $2.0 million in 2017, reflecting an 11% decrease in functional neurology sales and a 43% decrease in biologics and drug delivery sales; Case volume using the ClearPoint ® platform grew 11% to 160 complete cases from the prior year first quarter; Gross margin increased to 64% for the quarter, compared with 63% in 2017; Net loss in the first quarter 2018 was $1.6 million, as compared with $1.7 million in the same period 2017; Closed one capital system deal for the first quarter 2018 and initiated cases at one site; Grew the installed base of ClearPoint Systems to 53 centers in the U.S.; Completed development of ClearPoint 2.0 software, which has since been submitted to the FDA for 510(k) clearance; Continued to progress in the development of the Company’s neuro aspiration device with 510(k) submission planned for the third quarter of 2018 and first-human-case on track for December 2018; and Restructured the commercial organization, priorities and procedures to better position the Company for growth in the second half of 2018.\nJoe Burnett, President and Chief Executive Officer of MRI Interventions, Inc. said, “The first quarter of 2018 was an opportunity to “hit the reset button” and prepare our company and organization to execute on our five-year growth strategy. As part of that reset, we identified four pillars of growth: functional neurosurgery, biologics and drug delivery, expansion into therapy devices and global scale. Exiting the first quarter, we believe we have the plans, and, more importantly, the people, in place to exact ownership and accountability in making this vision our reality.”\nMr. Burnett continued, “We reorganized our functional neurosurgery commercial organization to better leverage the capacity of our talented sales and clinical teams to expand our market development capabilities. I have taken over commercial leadership with the sales and marketing team now reporting directly to me. Our new sales forecasting and reporting processes are designed to add increased transparency and accountability to our performance.\n“Although we achieved year-over-year growth in ClearPoint cases, we did not meet our internal targets. Importantly, however, through our new reporting and tracking protocols, we know exactly where those misses came from and are working to correct them on an account by account basis. Additionally, eight weeks ago, the FDA issued field action and warning letters to two of the largest players in the laser ablation space, and we have since seen eight cases canceled or postponed that we believe occurred as a result of those warnings. There were also two ClearPoint systems sales at facilities whose interest in ClearPoint focuses on laser ablation that were delayed, we believe, for the same reason. This said, we view these delayed sales as postponements, rather than losses, as the patients are still in need of therapy and hospitals are still in need of access to this important laser ablation technology.\n“In biologics and drug delivery, we initiated evaluations of ClearPoint and our drug delivery cannulas with three additional potential partners for inclusion in future preclinical and clinical work. We have continued progress toward obtaining CE Mark for our SmartFlow ® cannula and have identified internal resources who will actively focus on the growth of this exciting part of our business.\n“With regard to our expansion into therapy, we continue to progress, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, in the development of what we believe is the first-of-its-kind neuro-aspiration device, and we are planning to submit a 510(k) with the FDA in the third quarter of 2018, with first-human-use of the product following in December of this year.\n“As for achieving global scale, we have had discussions with prospective customers in three countries outside the U.S. and will continue those discussions into the second half of 2018. We have achieved scale on our operational expenses as seen with a 10% reduction is sales and marketing spend year over year, and a 100 basis point increase in gross margin despite the lower revenue.\n“In summary, we view first quarter as our opportunity to reorganize our people, processes and priorities around the exciting vision that we have ahead of us, and we will continue to update our investors on progress toward that vision throughout the year.”\nFinancial Results – Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nFunctional neurology revenue, which consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, decreased 11% to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $1.3 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was due primarily to a larger number of cases consuming two kits per case as opposed to one kit per case during the first quarter of 2017, relative to the same period in 2018 and end of quarter ordering patterns at some larger accounts in 2016 and 2017.\nBiologics and drug delivery systems revenue, which consists primarily of disposable product sales related to customer-sponsored clinical trials, decreased 43% to $211,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $373,000 for the same period in 2017. Revenues from this product line may vary from quarter to quarter based primarily on biotechnology customers’ scheduling of clinical trials. The decrease from the first quarter of 2017 to the same period in 2018 was due to the purchasing pattern of two biotechnology customers who purchased an aggregate of $305,000 of product during the first quarter of 2017, as compared to an aggregate of $74,000 during the same period in 2018. The company has made adjustments to its biologics and drug delivery business intended to enable delivery against open purchase orders across multiple quarters in order to alleviate a portion of the volatility in this business line. Trial partners have previously tended toward ordering large quantities which were inventories and used over multiple quarters.\nCapital equipment revenue, consisting of sales, rentals and service of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software, decreased 23% to $263,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $344,000 for the same period in 2017. Revenues from this product line historically have varied from quarter to quarter. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease from the first quarter of 2017 to the same period in 2018 in the number of ClearPoint systems sold and postponement of two capital deals related to joint acquisition with laser ablation systems.\nGross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 improved to 64% from 63% in the same period in 2017, due primarily to a favorable mix of revenue in the first quarter of 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development costs were $546,000 for three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $558,000 for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $11,000, or 2%. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in software development costs and pre-commercial license fees, being partially offset by increases in share-based compensation expenses and regulatory legal fees.\nSales and marketing expenses were $962,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $104,000, or 10%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales personnel costs due to: consolidation in the second quarter of 2017 of the Company’s sales and marketing leadership; and a decrease in incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2018, relative to the same period in 2017, based on lower sales volume. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in clinical personnel costs due to: an increase in clinical personnel headcount in the first quarter of 2018, relative to the same period in 2017; and relocation costs incurred in the first quarter of 2018 to position clinical personnel in closer proximity to high-volume customer locations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $953,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $984,000 for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $31,000, or 3%. This decrease was due primarily to decreases in professional and investor relations fees due to financing activity in which the Company was engaged during the first quarter of 2017 that did not recur during the same period in 2018\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a gain of $34,000 and a loss of $93,000, respectively, resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities at March 31, 2018 arose from an amendment the Company entered into with Brainlab, with respect to a note payable to Brainlab AG (“Brainlab”) and related warrants, the provisions of which created: a conversion feature allowing for $500,000 the principal balance of the note to be converted in a Qualified Public Offering, as defined in the amendment, at a public offering price that may be less than market value per share of the Company’s common stock; and down round strike price protection with respect to the warrants.\nDerivative liabilities at March 31, 2017 arose from the amendment to the note payable to Brainlab described above, and from warrants, issued in 2013, that contained net-cash settlement and down-round provisions and that expired in January 2018.\nNet interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $247,000, compared with $213,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase was due to increased amortization of the discount and deferred issuance costs associated with certain of our notes payable.\nTeleconference Information\nInvestors and analysts are invited to listen to a live broadcast review of the Company's 2018 first quarter financial results today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time (1:15 p.m. Pacific time) that may be accessed by visiting the Company's website at www.mriinterventions.com and selecting “Investors” / “News” / “IR Calendar.” The conference call may also be accessed at https://78449.themediaframe.com/dataconf/productusers/mric/mediaframe/24549/indexl.html .
