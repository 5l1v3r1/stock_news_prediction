The proceeds were transferred to dozens of jurisdictions and thousands of companies for various goods and services,” the FIU said in its annual report.\nIn that year, Estonia’s economy itself was worth just 17.9 billion euros.\nEstonian police also warned that more attempts to launder funds could be expected with further Russian bank closures likely this year.\nDenmark’s financial watchdog said this month it had found “serious weaknesses” in Danske Bank’s governance after investigating management and senior employees as part of an anti-money-laundering inquiry into Danske’s Estonian branch.\nThe bank could face further legal steps in Denmark, its justice minister and business minister made clear at a session of the Danish parliament’s business committee on Friday.\nDenmark’s State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime is now looking into the case, Justice Minister Soren Pape Poulsen said.\nBut the prosecutor’s office will await the Danish FSA’s conclusions, which are still open for appeals, and the outcome of an investigation by Estonia’s FSA before it announces any next step, Poulsen said.\n“There is a case now in Estonia. We’ve offered our assistance, but we would need help from the Estonian authorities regardless of what our next steps would be,” Poulsen said.\nA Danske Bank spokesman declined to comment.\nLatvian authorities warned on Thursday that an increased flow of questionable and illegally sourced money into other EU states was expected as Baltic authorities crack down on non-resident accounts.
