Soccer Football - Championship Play Off Semi Final First Leg - Middlesbrough vs Aston Villa - Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough, Britain - May 12, 2018 Aston Villa's Sam Johnstone and Jack Grealish celebrate after the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nThe Australian’s well-placed header from a corner gave Villa a deserved lead in the 15th minute, and the visitors came close to adding a second towards the end of the first half when Robert Snodgrass struck the post.\nMiddlesbrough applied plenty of pressure late in the game but could not create that clear-cut chance to get themselves back in the contest.\nThe pair meet again at Villa Park on Tuesday for the right to play Derby County or Fulham — Derby lead 1-0 after the first leg — in the playoff final at Wembley on May 26.

But it’s a small advantage.”\nBruce restored Jack Grealish to the starting lineup and the midfielder was instrumental in giving Villa the early lead.
