Until a full investigation was complete, it is impossible to say that all vulnerabilities had been closed, he added.\nMexico’s SPEI system is a domestic network similar to the SWIFT global messaging system that moves trillions of dollars each day.\nThe attack on Mexican banks is similar to one of the biggest-ever known cyber heists, when thieves stole $81 million from Bangladesh’s central bank in 2016.\nMexico’s central bank said on Tuesday that it would create a new unit to design and issue guidelines on information security for the country’s banks.\nDiaz de Leon said the central bank had an internal cyber security unit since 2013, and had beefed up protections in 2016, following the Bangladesh attack.
