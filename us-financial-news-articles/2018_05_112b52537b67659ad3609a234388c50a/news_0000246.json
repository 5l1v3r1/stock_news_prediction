(2 ) Consolidated results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include the impact of new tax legislation enacted in December 2017. (3 ) Consolidated results include expenses related to the acquisition of Ambrell Corporation of $55,000 for fourth quarter of 2017. “The first quarter was fueled across the board by continued demand for our broad-based solutions, a testament to the strength of our customer relationships and the depth of our product suite,” commented inTEST President & CEO James Pelrin. “We continue to benefit from the robust demand environment associated with the semiconductor industry, with automotive sensors, mobility technologies and IoT (Internet of Things) leading our semiconductor test business, while non-semi business drivers included solid demand in the automotive, telecom, and defense/aerospace markets. Our Ambrell business has made significant contributions to inTEST, and its first quarter 2018 record bookings of $7.0 million increased 14% sequentially and 53% year-over-year.\n“We are very pleased to mark a return to delivering quarterly profits on a GAAP basis. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, we had reported 32 consecutive quarters of profitability. This trend would have continued in the fourth quarter had the increase in our contingent consideration liability not caused a GAAP net loss. In the fourth quarter we booked a $7.5 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, contingent consideration adjustment (related to the earnout for Ambrell). 2018 first quarter GAAP net earnings per diluted share of $0.04 included the impact of an increase in our contingent consideration liability of $1.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. Net revenues of $18.9 million came in at the high end of our guidance, and both gross margin of 50% and non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $0.22 exceeded our guidance.”\nMr. Pelrin concluded, “We are well positioned to capture market share in the markets we serve, while expanding inTEST’s footprint in additional thermal test and industrial markets. As we continue to execute on our differentiated product strategy, we believe the conditions for our long-term success remain firmly in place and we are solidly on track for a strong 2018.”\n2018 Second Quarter Financial Outlook\ninTEST expects that net revenues for the second quarter of 2018 will be in the range of $19.0 million to $20.0 million and that on a GAAP basis, net earnings per diluted share will range from $0.20 to $0.24. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net earnings per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.26. This outlook is based on the Company’s current views with respect to operating and market conditions and customers’ forecasts, which are subject to change.\n2018 First Quarter Conference Call Details\ninTEST management will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 5:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time.

The Company will address as many questions as possible on the conference call.\nNon-GAAP Results\nIn addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we also disclose non-GAAP performance measures. These non-GAAP performance measures include adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings is derived by adding acquired intangible amortization, adjusted for the related income tax expense, to net earnings and removing any change in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability from net earnings. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share is derived by dividing adjusted net earnings by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are non-GAAP performance measures presented to provide investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding our baseline performance before acquired intangible amortization charges and changes in the estimate of future consideration that may be paid out related to prior acquisitions as these expenses or income items may not be indicative of our current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to make operational decisions, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with our business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of our peers. A reconciliation of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share, which are discussed in this earnings release, is contained in the tables below. The non-GAAP performance measures discussed in this earnings release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout inTEST Corporation\ninTEST Corporation designs and manufactures engineered solutions for ATE and other electronic test, as well as industrial process applications.
