Bitcoin's market value was about $150.1 billion.\n\"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering.\nLast month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures.\nZcash incorporates the technology \"zk-snark,\" short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity.\nGemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later.\n\"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office.\nThe Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website.\nThey also competed in the men's rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
