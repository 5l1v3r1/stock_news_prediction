Of all the pole runs I’ve had here this one, believe it or not came the easiest.”\nCarpenter, whose best Indy 500 result came in 2008 when he placed fifth, had shown his car’s potential on Saturday when he came on strong to finish second fastest in qualifying runs.\nFrenchman Sebastien Bourdais, who missed last year’s race after a horrific crash while fighting for pole, showed no fear as he returned to the Brickyard, grabbing fifth place (228.142).\nThe former Formula One driver said the crash impacted his run on Sunday.\n“It was probably the hardest weekend we have had to go through. It was hard, really hard,” he said.\n“I had a little moment there in (turn) one, I didn’t trust it, got my foot off it a bit and it showed big time on the speed.\n“What happened last year you can’t just disregard. I probably would have stayed in it pretty easily last year but thought twice about it this year for sure.”\nReigning champion Takuma Sato of Japan will start on the sixth row after posting an average speed of 226.557 in a Honda.
