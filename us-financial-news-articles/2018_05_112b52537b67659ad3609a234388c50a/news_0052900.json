The company said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries from the flaw, but did identify one owner of a 2017 Dodge Journey crossover who experienced it.\nIt impacts certain 2014-2019 model year vehicles with automatic transmissions and gasoline-powered engines, the company said. Included are vehicles across 16 models sold under the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands, including the 2018 Jeep Wrangler SUV and 2014-2019 Ram 1500 pickup, it said.
