But he believes buybacks will continue to require regulatory approval with each programme.\n“This is good and will be accretive to earnings and book (value) in most cases,” Echlov said.\nZev Marynberg, chief investment officer at hedge fund firm Adar Capital Partners, said: “We are cautiously optimistic with Israeli banks, as the economy continues strongly to grow and banks have a quasi-monopoly.”\nLeumi, Israel’s second-largest bank, said last week it planned to buy back up to 700 million shekels ($195 million), or 2 percent, of its shares, by March 31, 2019. Leumi, though, needed special permission from the central bank for what would be the first move of its kind in three decades.\nLeumi and its main rival, Hapoalim, pay dividends equal to 40 percent of net profit, which Ber noted was above the average of about 35 percent for U.S. banks. But U.S. banks buy back shares at profit levels that can exceed 100 percent.\nBer added that buybacks are more flexible than dividends.\nHedge funds have been betting the landmark move by the Israeli financial regulator to permit buybacks will lead to further programmes from other banks.\nBer, speaking after the central bank issued its annual report on the Israeli banking system, also said there had been strong interest from a local and foreign institutions and private equity funds to buy the credit card companies from Israel’s largest banks, as required under a recent Israeli law.\nOn the banking system, Ber said Israeli banks are becoming more efficient due to a reduction of staff and branches. She said the three mid-sized banks, Mizrahi-Tefahot, Discount and First International, had shown a jump in credit supply and now have a 44 percent market share.\nBanks still supply about 80 percent of credit in the country and Ber expects in coming years there will be more competition for credit from technology firms, similar to Alibaba.\n$1 = 3.5842 shekels Reporting by Steven Scheer Editing by David Goodman and David Holmes\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
