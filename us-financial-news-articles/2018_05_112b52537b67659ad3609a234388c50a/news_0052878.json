He remains an asset to the cricketing world. No we are not giving him away @narendramodi.”\nHyderabad paid 40 million rupees ($590,580) at last year’s auction to land the leg-spinner from Afghanistan, where cricket is highly popular but sporting facilities are pitifully inadequate after decades of war.\nAn intense bidding war erupted for his services in the auction this year before Hyderabad exercised their right-to-match option for a staggering 90 million rupees ($1.33 million).\nHe has made rapid strides since making his international debut in October 2015 as a 17-year-old, in February becoming the youngest to top the International Cricket Council’s rankings for bowlers in the Twenty20 and 50-overs format.\nHyderabad coach Tom Moody had predicted the leg-spinner to have a major impact on this year’s IPL.\nHe has taken 21 wickets with an economy rate of less than seven and earned a glowing tribute from former India batting great Sachin Tendulkar on Friday.\n“Always felt @rashidkhan_19 was a good spinner but now I wouldn’t hesitate in saying he is the best spinner in the world in this format,” Tendulkar said on Twitter.\n“Mind you, he’s got some batting skills as well. Great guy.” $1 = 67.7300 Indian rupees Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T11:24:39.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
