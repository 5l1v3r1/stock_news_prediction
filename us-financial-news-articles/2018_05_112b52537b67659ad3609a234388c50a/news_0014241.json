He struck out six and helped the Giants win for the fifth time in their last six games.\nMost of Stratton’s support came in the second inning, when the Giants plated six runs against Atlanta starter Mike Foltynewicz (2-2). The right-hander gave up a season-high six runs on nine hits in five innings and lost for the first time since April 10. It was his first time allowing more than two earned runs in an outing this season.\nThe loss spoiled the Atlanta debut of former All-Star Jose Bautista, who started at third base and went 1-for-4 with two strikeouts. He doubled in his first at-bat. Bautista, signed to a minor league contract last month, was promoted on Friday, with Preston Tucker being sent to Triple-A Gwinnett.\nIt was also the first home game for rookie Ronald Acuna Jr., who went 0-for-4 in his debut at a sold-out SunTrust Park.\nAtlanta jumped on Stratton for two runs in the first on Freddie Freeman’s home run, his fifth.\nBut San Francisco answered by scoring six times against Foltynewicz in the second. Gregor Blanco tripled home a pair and scored on Alen Hanson’s double. Hanson scored on a fielder’s choice after a tag play was overturned on a video review. Brandon Belt drove in a run with a double, and Evan Longoria got another run home with a ground ball.\nThe Braves cut the lead to 6-3 in the third when Nick Markakis hit a solo home run, his sixth.\nSan Francisco tacked on two insurance runs in the seventh inning on Brandon Crawford’s two-run homer, his third, off reliever Jesse Biddle.\nAtlanta got one run back in the seventh on Ozzie Albies’ sacrifice fly.\nThe Giants added a solo homer from Longoria in the ninth, his seventh.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:08:06.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
