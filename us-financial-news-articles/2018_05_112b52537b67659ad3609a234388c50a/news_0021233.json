( bit.ly/2KIlttK )\nSSE and Npower did not offer measures to address the CMA’s concerns, and so it has referred the merger for a more in-depth, Phase 2 investigation, the watchdog said.\nA decision on the SSE-Npower merger will now be made by a group of independent panel members supported by a case team of CMA staff, CMA said. The deadline for the final report is Oct. 22, it added.
