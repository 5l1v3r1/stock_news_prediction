Expect considerable tree damage. Wind damage is also likely to mobile homes, roofs, and outbuildings,” the service said in an advisory, adding that some 31 million people lived in the areas that could be affected.\nWinds may bring down small tree limbs and cause isolated power outages, it added.\nTornadoes were also possible, particularly across upstate New York. Dozens of tornadoes have been reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Missouri over the last three days. No one was injured, but several structures were flattened, the service reported.
