The Brazilian-born player suffered a broken toe in March but is already back in action.\nRolando and Jose Fonte, also in their 30s, were all over the place as Portugal lost 3-0 to the Dutch in their last friendly.\nBruno Alves is also well into his 30s, leaving Luis Neto as the only central defender under 30 with international experience.\nIt would be wrong to write off Portugal, however. Ronaldo is as dangerous as ever — as he showed by blasting 15 goals in the qualifiers.\nWith players such as William Carvalho, Joao Moutinho and Bernardo, there is plenty of talent elsewhere in the squad and, under Santos, Portugal have made an art form out of grinding out 1-0 wins\nIt is also worth bearing in mind their formidable record —under Santos Portugal have lost only one out of 29 competitive internationals.\nWriting by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:26:15.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
