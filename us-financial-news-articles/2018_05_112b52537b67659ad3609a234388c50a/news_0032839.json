Technical indicators suggested the Treasuries market is the most oversold since three weeks ago, when the 10-year yield rose above 3 percent for the first time since January 2014. Still many traders expect Treasury prices would resume their fall, pushing 10-year yields toward 3.25 percent, which was last seen in May 2011. \"It's a grind higher in yields,\" said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co in New York. \"I think the data are still pretty good. They make people think the economy is doing well.\" To be sure, if Wall Street unravels as investors view Treasuries as a compelling alternative to stocks, or a resurgent dollar hurts oil and other commodity prices, that could rekindle a bid for U.S. government bonds, analysts said. At 9:48 a.m. ET (1348 GMT), the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was down 2 basis points at 3.091 percent after touching 3.128 percent in overseas trading, which was the highest level since July 2011, Reuters data showed. On the week, the 10-year yield was on track to increase 12 basis points, its biggest weekly gain in a month. The two-year Treasury yield was about 2 basis points lower at 2.557 percent, pulling back from a nearly decade peak of 2.598 percent reached on Thursday. The two-year yield was on course to rise for six straight weeks, which would be the longest such streak since 10 consecutive weeks of increase in the fourth quarter of 2017. The yield on 30-year bonds touched 3.264 percent earlier Friday, which was the highest since October 2014. It was on track for its largest weekly rise since early February. Demand for Treasuries will be tested next week as the Treasury Department is scheduled to sell $99 billion in fixed-rate coupon issues and $16 billion in two-year floating-rate notes (FRN).
