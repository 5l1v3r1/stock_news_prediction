Analysts had forecast a result of A$3.46 billion.\n“The result was a couple of hundred million dollars better than we expected so the market should respond well to this result,” said Hugh Dive, Chief Investment Officer of Atlas Funds Management, which owns ANZ shares.\nIndeed, ANZ shares climbed 1.9 percent in afternoon trade, while the broader market was up 0.5 percent.\nThe Melbourne-headquartered company has been selling non-core assets like wealth management and car finance, part of a broader industry trend to simplify business structure. The cash profit measure excludes one-off and non-cash accounting items.\n“Because of the divestments, this result is quite messy, but going forward, ANZ will be a much cleaner business,” Dive added.\nNet interest income, the bank’s main earner, fell 1 percent to A$7.35 billion, but this was offset by a 44 percent slide in bad debt charges from the previous year.
