Carter was initially subpoenaed in Nov. 16, 2017. Then second subpoena for his testimony was issued on Feb. 23, 2018, after changes to his legal team.\n“Carter failed to appear as required by the subpoenas and, through his counsel, Carter has declined to provide any additional dates on which he will agree to appear for investigative testimony,” the SEC said in a statement .\nThe subpoena “does not reflect a determination by the SEC or its staff that Carter has violated provisions of the federal securities laws at issue in the investigation,” they said.\n“We are aware that the SEC is seeking information on Iconix’ s financial reporting,” a representative from Roc Nation told Fortune in an email. “Mr. Carter had no role in that reporting or Iconix’ s other actions as a public company. Mr. Carter is a private citizen who should not be involved in this matter.”\nThis story has been updated to include the statement from Roc Nation.", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/iconix-buys-rocawear-for-204-mln-with-jay-z-remaining", "https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2018/lr24131.htm", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/12/28/iconix-confirms-sec-investigation-shares-plunge/77968084/"], "published": "2018-05-04T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T01:40:05.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
