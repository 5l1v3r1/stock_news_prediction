We want to write our own story.\n“We are going to play match by match, but the most important thing is to be ready on the day of the game,” the West Ham United midfielder added.\nSenegal’s preparations got off to a slow start with just seven players on hand for their first training session at the Diambars academy, some 80-kilometres from the capital Dakar, on Tuesday.\nHowever, they expect a full squad on Thursday, save for Sadio Mane, who plays for Liverpool in the Champions League final against Real Madrid in Kiev on Saturday.\n“It is our brother who plays and although there are supporters of Real Madrid in our squad, for this final everyone supports Liverpool because we want Sadio to win this trophy,” Kouyate added.\n“We hope he will do it because it will push us to try and win the World Cup.”\nReporting by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:25:19.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
