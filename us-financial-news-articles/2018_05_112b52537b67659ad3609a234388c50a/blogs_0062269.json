Last May, WannaCry ransomware hit health-care organizations across England. Hospitals had to find manual workarounds for a variety of tasks. The attack spread by exploiting a known vulnerability for which Microsoft Corp . had issued a patch months earlier. Weeks later, consumer-goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC , pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co . and shipping giant A.P.

Defense contractor Raytheon Co . has five people who manage rollouts of patches and monitor whether customers are updating systems, says CISO Jeff Brown.

The goal is for about 95% of the devices to be patched within a few days. The remaining 5% usually consists of people on vacation, and servers that can’t run the patch because they have a unique configuration or have applications that won’t work if the patch is installed. “You’re never going to get to 100% patched—it’s a worthy goal, but it’s never going to happen,” Mr. Brown says.\nAUTOMOTIVE TECH\nA Tesla Model 3 car is displayed at an auto show in Beijing in April.
