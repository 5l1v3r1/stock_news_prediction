Cloud revenues represented 32% of fourth quarter revenues, compared to 19.3% for the same period last year, while cloud subscription revenues have grown 58% and represent 9.1% of total revenue, compared to 6.7% of total revenue in the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we added four new clients.”\n“As a result of the strong revenue growth and favorable mix of cloud-based revenues, profitability continues to improve and adjusted EBITDA, as a percent of revenues was 8.8%, 310 basis points higher than the same quarter last year and 200 basis points higher than the fiscal 2018 third quarter. I am encouraged by the return to net profitability in the fourth quarter after net losses in the four prior consecutive quarters. Momentum in our business remains strong and we ended the year with a robust backlog of $90.6 million which is 41.5% higher than the backlog a year ago. We have also grown our recurring revenue by 34% during the year, further strengthening the predictability of our business.\n“I am extremely pleased with our record fourth quarter results and see that our focus and investments are well aligned with the disruption taking place in the industry. Insurance carriers across all tiers as well as incumbent greenfields and InsurTech startups throughout the P&C, L&A and Group markets are recognizing Majesco for our leading solutions that enable growth and innovation strategies by delivering speed to value. Majesco is at the forefront of the shift to Digital Insurance 2.0, and during the year we announced several new initiatives strengthening our position as a leading platform company in the insurance industry. Carriers are taking notice of our partnership with IBM as we signed one of the largest cloud deals in the industry with MetLife for digital transformation. Moreover, we announced our microservices based Majesco Digital1 st Platform, a new cloud-only digital platform which offers cutting-edge capabilities designed to rapidly develop and deploy innovative insurance digital solutions in days rather than months or years. One important component of Majesco’s Digital 1 st platform is EcoExchange, a marketplace of insurance solution partners for quick and easy integration. In addition, we had a new release of Majesco P&C Suite and Majesco L&A and Group suite providing further out-of-the box digital capabilities.\n“Fiscal 2018 was a transformative year. I am excited to support our customers’ transition to Digital Insurance 2.0 and the opportunities to grow our business in fiscal 2019 and beyond,” concluded Ketan Mehta, Majesco’s CEO and Co-Founder.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor the fourth quarter\nRevenue for the fourth quarter , was $32.9 million as compared to $28.2 million in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal year. The 17.0% increase is driven by the successful ramp up of the IBM program, growth in our subscription revenues and growth in the APAC market. Gross profit was $15.4 million (46.9% of revenue) for the fourth quarter , compared to $13.4 million (47.6% of revenue) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Though the margin in absolute values grew 15% on the back of higher revenues, as a percentage of revenue it came in lower mainly due to the ramp up in resources to deliver the new programs that were won in the last two quarters as well as create a resource pool for future growth. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $4.6 million (13.9% of revenue) during the fourth quarter , as compared to $4.2 million (15.0% of revenue) during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The company continues to invest in R&D to increase the depth as well as range of its offering portfolio. SG&A expenses were $10.0 million (30.4% of revenue) during the fourth quarter , as compared to $9.4 million (33.5% of revenue) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. With the growth in revenue, the decline in SG&A as a percentage of revenue reflects improved operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter , was $2.9 million (8.8% of revenue) as compared to $1.6 million (5.7% of revenue) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Sequentially, EBITDA, as a percentage of revenue, was higher by 200 basis points as compared to the previous quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the fourth quarter was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, or $(0.02) per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation tables of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as used in this press release to GAAP are included in the financial section of this press release.\nFor the fiscal year\nRevenue for the fiscal year was $123.0 million as compared to $121.8 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Though the growth for the year is only about 1%, there has been a significant shift in our revenue profile. Revenue from on-premise implementation have declined 25% on a full year basis, whereas cloud revenues have increased 57% and fully mitigate this decline. We expect continued growth in cloud revenues to more than offset the decline on-premise implementation revenues. Gross profit was $55.9 million (45.4% of revenue) for the fiscal year , compared to $58.3 million (47.9% of revenue) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The decline in gross profit margin was primarily due to the ramp up of resources to support revenue growth in our cloud business and recent new customer wins. R&D expenses were $17.3 million (14.0% of revenue) during the fiscal year as compared to $17.2 million (14.2% of revenue) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. R&D expenses in fiscal 2018 were aligned to new product developments and the digital forays. SG&A expenses were $41.0 million (33.4% of revenue) during the fiscal year as compared to $41.3 million (33.9% of revenue) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The investment in sales continued while the savings were derived from the G&A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year was $5.7 million (4.6% of revenue) as compared to $6.1 million (5.0% of revenue) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Net loss for the fiscal year was $5.0 million, or $(0.14) per share as compared to a net loss of $0.9 million, or $(0.02) per share, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. During the fiscal 2018 third quarter, the company made an adjustment of $2.67 million, or $0.07 per share to write down the company’s deferred tax asset in line with the recent changes made to the Tax Code.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation tables of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as used in this press release to GAAP are included in the financial section of this press release.\nBalance Sheet\nMajesco had cash and cash equivalents of $9.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $11.5 million at December 31, 2017, and $12.5 million as at March 31, 2017. Total debt at March 31, 2018, was $13.6 million, compared to $13.0 million at December 31, 2017 and $12.6 million as at March 31, 2017. DSO’s were 80 days at March 31, 2018, as compared to 72 days in the previous quarter ended December 31, 2017. The higher DSO’s is primarily due to the year-end billings linked to milestones achievement.\nHighlights of customer wins during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 include:\nDuring the quarter, Majesco had four new client wins including: A tier one global property and casualty insurer selected Majesco Billing for their new greenfield to support small commercial products following a rapid five-month process.

In addition, a tier one specialty insurer extended our relation and signed a three-year agreement for application management services with Majesco to support their worker’s compensation operational systems.

We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We present EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before stock-based compensation.\nThe terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and are not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing Majesco’s operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other things, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our actual cash expenditures. Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than Majesco, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools. We compensate for these limitations by relying on U.S. GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nAbout Majesco\nMajesco enables insurance business transformation for approximately 160 global customers by providing technology solutions which include software products, consulting and IT services. Our customers are carriers from the Property and Casualty, Life, Annuity and Group insurance segments worldwide.
