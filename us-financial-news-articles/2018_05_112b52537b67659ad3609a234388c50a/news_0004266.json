However, the rest of the year will have the same as the same period in 2017, he said.\nGold is an essential part of a bride’s dowry in India and also a popular gift from family and guests at weddings.\nIndia’s gold consumption in 2018 is likely be between 700 and 800 tonnes versus 737.5 tonnes last year, Somasundaram said. Indian demand has averaged 840 tonnes over the last 10 years.\nReporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:06:13.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
