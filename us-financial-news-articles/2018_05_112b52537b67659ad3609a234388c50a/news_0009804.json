One analyst saw a 25-basis point hike.\nThe central bank has lifted its main two-week repo rate in three steps since last August after nearly five years of ultra-loose policy of rates near zero combined with interventions against the Czech currency.\nEight analysts in the Reuters poll see the next tightening in the third quarter, including five that predict an expected 25-basis point move at an Aug. 2 meeting at which the next quarterly update to the macroeconomic outlook will be discussed.\nThat would be much sooner than currently expected by the central bank. The latest staff forecast projects the next hike at the turn of the year at the earliest.\nSuch a market expectation points to a weaker crown exchange rate than forecast by the bank so far. The currency outlook will be an important factor in the bank’s new forecasts on Thursday.
