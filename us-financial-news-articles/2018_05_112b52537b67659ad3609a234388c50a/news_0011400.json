PETL will own the power plants and channel the electricity supply.\n“The agreement ... frees the Palestinian electricity sector of complete Israeli control, which has lasted for decades,” said a statement issued in the name of Hussein Al-Sheikh, head of the PA’s civil affairs agency.\nIsraeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said the agreement paves the way for Palestinians to develop a modern grid.\n“(The deal) brings about a new reality in the Palestinians’ energy sector, reduces restrictions on electricity supply, strengthens economic stability...and opens a new era in economic relations between the two sides,” said Israeli Finance Ministry Director-General Shai Babad.\nPalestinians in Gaza, an impoverished coastal enclave largely blockaded by Israel, suffer up to 18 hours of power cuts per day due to fuel shortages. The electricity Gaza gets from Israel, Egypt and a local power plant remains under half the estimated 600 megawatts that would satisfy daily needs.\nTalks on a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza have been frozen since 2014 and Israel and the PA have sparred repeatedly over unpaid PA debts to the IEC. The deal includes collateral and a guarantee mechanism to ensure the IEC is paid.\nReporting by Steven Scheer in Jerusalem, Ali Sawafta in the West Bank and Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T17:27:50.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
