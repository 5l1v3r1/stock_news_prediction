The mining division focused on its efforts on restoring mining volumes and sales of coal products, while the steel division continued with optimization of its product range and mastering new product types.\n“The new mining equipment arriving on our facilities has already begun yielding returns, and mining has stabilized quarter-on-quarter, while stripping volumes went up sharply. The share of high value-added products in the steel division’s sales structure continues to increase. In order to fulfill the assigned tasks, we continue to implement our capital investment program, with investment totaling 2 billion rubles in 1Q 2018 including finance lease.\n“Nevertheless, there have been complications — in this reporting period there were limits set on transporting cargo to Far Eastern ports, and railcars were in short supply in Kuzbass. These factors, together with our halting Neryungrinskaya Washing Plant for planned repairs, led to a decrease in coking coal concentrate sales and run-of-mine coking coal accumulating in Yakutugol’s storage facilities, which led to a decrease in the mining division’s results. At the same time, the steel division’s operations were more stable.\n“The market conditions in this quarter were favorable. Coal prices were at a good level and the highest since the peak of 1Q 2017. Right now, coal prices are stabilizing. The steel product market also demonstrated certain stability and was profitable for our company.\n“Overall, the Group’s revenue remained practically unchanged both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, though EBITDA went down by 16% quarter-on-quarter mostly due to the weaker results in the mining division. Nevertheless, EBITDA margin remained at a fairly good level of 25%, and in this quarter the Group earned 3.3 billion rubles of profit attributable to equity shareholders of Mechel PAO.”\nConsolidated Results For The 1Q2018\nMln rubles 1Q’ 1 8 1Q’ 1 7 % 1Q’ 1 8 4Q’ 17 % Revenue\nfrom external customers 74,852 77,414 -3 % 74,852 76,316 -2 % Operating profit 13,383 18,089 -26 % 13,383 10,752 24 % EBITDA 18,436 22,806 -19 % 18,436 21,966 -16 % EBITDA, margin 25% 29% 25% 29% Profit\nattributable to equity shareholders of Mechel PAO 3,293 13,902 -76 % 3,293 443\n* EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA. Please find the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures used here and hereafter in Attachment A.\nMining Segment\nMechel Mining Management OOO’s Chief Executive Officer Pavel Shtark noted:\n“In 1Q 2018 the mining division’s results were weaker both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. The main reason of that was the decrease in sales volumes of the division’s products, particularly coking coal concentrate.\n“Starting in mid-2017, the division’s facilities are implementing a program aimed at restoring mining volumes to the level of previous years. As of now, we have already acquired and commissioned a large number of mining machines, and brought in contractors with equipment of their own. We managed to attain a major increase in stripping volumes, and coal mining has stabilized. Overall, in 1Q 2018 the division demonstrated a small growth in mining volumes compared to the previous quarter. At the same time, sales of finished products have decreased for a number of reasons. For example, some shipments that have been planned for the first quarter were put off until the second quarter due to railcar shortages.\n“Among positive factors I would like to note a significant growth of stripping volumes at our Yakut facilities. Preparing reserves for future mining will help to restore production volumes reduced earlier. In addition, new equipment and machines continue to arrive at the mining division’s facilities, including equipment for washing plants, which will help improve their operational efficiency.\n“I would like to note that the market conditions in the first quarter were favorable. Positive dynamics in prices for high-quality coking coal, which we observed in late 2017, caused the first quarter’s contract prices to be fixed at the level of 237 dollars per tonne, which resulted in higher average prices quarter-on-quarter even as spot prices somewhat declined. In this quarter, we see the markets weaker to the level of 4Q 2017, which is still quite acceptable for our company.”\nMln rubles 1Q’ 1 8 1Q’ 1 7 % 1Q’ 1 8 4Q’ 17 % Revenue\nfrom external customers 22,724 27,988 -19 % 22,724 25,444 -11 % Revenue\ninter-segment 9,412 12,465 -24 % 9,412 9,312 1 % EBITDA 10,483 19,956 -47 % 10,483 14,098 -26 % EBITDA, margin 33% 49% 33% 41% Steel Segment\nMechel-Steel Management Company OOO’s Chief Executive Officer Andrey Ponomarev noted:\n“The division obtained good results in this reporting period. We demonstrated revenue growth quarter-on-quarter. The EBITDA’s decrease by 7% was mostly due to a decrease in inter-segment sales and a minor growth of production costs. Production and sales remained at stable levels.\n“The division’s entities continue to master production of new types of high value-added products both by expanding the assortment of the products we have already made as well as launching production of new product types for various industries. As part of these projects’ implementation, our facilities have already upgraded several manufacturing areas and equipment that meant not only their adaptation to putting out new product types, but also increased ecological safety of production.\n“Despite a seasonal decrease in Russia’s construction market in the first quarter, prices in this reporting period were fairly stable and generally profitable for the division. In the second quarter we expect the market for construction steel products to become stronger as business activity picks up and export parity prices go up.”\nMln rubles 1Q’ 1 8 1Q’ 1 7 % 1Q’ 1 8 4Q’ 17 % Revenue\nfrom external customers 44,238 42,029 5 % 44,238 43,383 2 % Revenue\ninter-segment 1,590 1,964 -19 % 1,590 2,209 -28 % EBITDA 6,204 3,556 74 % 6,204 6,642 -7 % EBITDA, margin 14% 8% 14% 15% Power Segment\nMechel-Energo OOO’s Chief Executive Officer Petr Pashnin noted:\n“The power segment continues to demonstrate stable positive financial results. In this quarter, with the facilities’ capacity utilization at their traditional seasonal high, we had an additional increase of heat sales quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, which was a result of lower outdoor temperatures. As electricity generation and sales volumes remained stable, this had a positive impact on the dynamics of our revenue from sales to third parties. As a result, our EBITDA grew comparing to the same period of previous year. A quarter-on-quarter decrease in EBITDA was primarily due to the growth of commercial costs and additional provisions for doubtful accounts.”\nMln rubles 1Q’ 1 8 1Q’ 1 7 % 1Q’ 1 8 4Q’ 17 % Revenue\nfrom external customers 7,891 7,396 7 % 7,891 7,489 5 % Revenue\ninter-segment 4,037 4,638 -13 % 4,037 4,427 -9 % EBITDA 737 705 5 % 737 1,319 -44 % EBITDA, margin 6% 6% 6% 11% The management of Mechel will host a conference call today at 6:00 p.m. Moscow time (4:00 p.m. London time, 11:00 a.m. New York time) to review Mechel’s financial results and comment on current operations.
