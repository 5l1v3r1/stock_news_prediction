We are looking at our own game and not our opponent,” said Ito.\n“The other team has five players, so it’s the same. We really concentrate on our game - we will do what we want to do. That’s what we plan to do.”\nThe move follows the North and South Korean leaders’ pledge to work for “complete denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula last week.\nThe two Koreas had earlier this year joined forces to field a combined women’s ice hockey team at the Pyeongchang Winter Games after they marched in together for the opening ceremony.
