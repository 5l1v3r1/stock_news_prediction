Net impairment on financial assets in the quarter was at a similar level to the same period last year and 29 percent lower than in the fourth quarter, the bank said.\nStanChart in February unveiled a new medium-term goal of an 8 percent return on equity, as it recovers from a restructuring that saw the key profitability metric fall into the negative. It has not announced the timetable for achieving the goal.\nIt posted an annualized return on equity of 7.6 percent in the March quarter, compared to 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"This encouraging start to the year shows that we are firmly on the path laid out in February that will take us above an 8 percent return on equity in the medium term,\" Winters said in the statement.\nLosses from bad debts had plagued StanChart in the recent past, but the bank has since tightened limits on who can make decisions about such big loans and decreased internal limits for exposure to a single client.\nHong Kong shares of StanChart were trading up 0.8 percent after the results, while the broader Hong Kong market was down 0.6 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T07:59:10.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
