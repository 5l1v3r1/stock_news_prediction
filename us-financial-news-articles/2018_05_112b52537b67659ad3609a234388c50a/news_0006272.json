REUTERS/Russell Boyce/Files\nWednesday’s IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) jumped to 52.5 in April from 47.0 in March. That was comfortably above the median expectation of 50.5 in a Reuters poll of economists and back above the 50 line denoting growth in activity.\nNonetheless, survey compiler IHS Markit said the recovery was “somewhat underwhelming” after snowstorms dubbed “the Beast from the East” hit the sector in late February and early March.\nLooking at the PMI over the three months to April, smoothing out a sharp fall in March and a bounce-back last month, the survey showed construction activity was barely growing.\n“(The survey) provides an indication that the construction sector has been treading water at the very best in recent months,” Tim Moore, economist at IHS Markit, said.\nConstruction accounts for only around 6 percent of British economic output.\nA separate survey covering Britain’s manufacturers, which was published on Tuesday, showed growth in the factory sector cooled to a 17-month low in April, sending sterling below $1.37 for the first time in 3-1/2 months.\nEven before this week’s PMIs and weak overall economic growth data for the January-March period last week, Governor Mark Carney had suggested the BoE might not raise rates to a new post-financial-crisis high of 0.75 percent on May 10.\nOfficial figures have suggested that the construction industry had a terrible start to 2018, but Wednesday’s PMI showed some signs of a brightening mood.\nBusiness expectations hit an 11-month high in April, while new construction orders grew for the first time in four months - albeit barely.\nThe PMI for the much larger services sector is due on Thursday.\n- Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from IHS Markit and customers need to apply for a licence.\nTo subscribe to the full data, click on the link below: here\nFor further information, please phone IHS Markit on +800 6275 4800 or email economics@ihsmarkit.com Reporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by Hugh Lawson; andy.bruce@thomsonreuters.com; +442075423484; Reuters Messaging: andy.bruce.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net", "external_links": ["https://www.ihsmarkit.com/about/contact-us.html"], "published": "2018-05-02T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T12:45:21.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
