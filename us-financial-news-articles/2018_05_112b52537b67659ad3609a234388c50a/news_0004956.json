REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\nLast week, Glencore said its mining subsidiaries in the Democratic Republic of Congo were served freezing orders for alleged unpaid royalties of nearly $3 billion by a company affiliated with Gertler.\nA spokesman for Glencore declined to comment. Gertler’s Fleurette Group and his foundation did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request to comment.\nGertler, who is the subject of U.S. sanctions, is owed some royalties by Glencore, but the London-listed company disputes the amounts claimed.\nGertler’s Ventora Development Sasu is seeking $695 million in unpaid and future royalties from Glencore’s unit Mutanda Mining and $2.28 billion from Glencore unit Kamoto Copper Co (KCC)\nThe injunction forbids Gertler from taking any steps in his legal action against the KCC mine, the FT said. There will be a hearing on the case in London on May 11, the newspaper said. Reporting by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru.
