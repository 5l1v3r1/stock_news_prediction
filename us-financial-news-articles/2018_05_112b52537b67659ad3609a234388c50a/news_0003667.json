Same property occupancy increased to 95.3% during the quarter, a 20 basis point increase compared to year end. We also continued to advance our property disposition plans, completing the sale of one office property in the quarter. The marketing of additional properties for sale continues to progress, with two office properties currently under agreement to sell for $129.3 million and additional properties identified to market for potential sale during the quarter.”\nResults for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018:\nNet income available for common shareholders determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $6.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income available for common shareholders of $7.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net income available for common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 includes a $12.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, unrealized gain on equity securities, partially offset by a $6.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, loss on impairment of real estate and $2.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of estimated business management incentive fee expense. The weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was 99.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 71.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNormalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, available for common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $54.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to Normalized FFO available for common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $39.9 million, or $0.56 per diluted share.\nReconciliations of net income available for common shareholders determined in accordance with GAAP to funds from operations, or FFO, available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 appear later in this press release.\nLeasing, Occupancy and Same Property Results:\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, GOV entered new and renewal leases for an aggregate 280,419 rentable square feet at weighted (by rentable square feet) average rents that were 4.9% above prior rents for the same space. The weighted average (by rentable square feet) lease term for leases entered during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 5.6 years. Leasing concessions and capital commitments for new and renewal leases entered during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $8.0 million, or $5.13 per square foot, per lease year. GOV's leasing during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included approximately 72,000 square feet entered with government tenants for a weighted average (by rentable square feet) lease term of 8.2 years, weighted average (by rentable square feet) rents that were 20.2% higher than prior rents for the same space and leasing concessions and capital commitments of $6.20 per square foot per weighted average lease year.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 94.4% of GOV’s total rentable square feet was leased, compared to 94.2% as of December 31, 2017 and 95.1% as of March 31, 2017. Occupancy for properties owned continuously since January 1, 2017, or same properties, was 95.3% as of March 31, 2018, which compares with 95.1% as of December 31, 2017 and 95.7% as of March 31, 2017. Same properties net operating income, or NOI, decreased 1.2% and same properties cash basis NOI, or Cash Basis NOI, increased 0.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nReconciliations of net income available for common shareholders determined in accordance with GAAP to Consolidated Property NOI and to Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 appear later in this press release.\nRecent Disposition Activities:\nIn March 2018, GOV sold an office property (one building) located in Minneapolis, MN with 193,594 rentable square feet for $20.0 million, excluding closing costs.\nIn February 2018, GOV entered an agreement to sell an office property (one building) located in Sacramento, CA with 110,500 rentable square feet for $10.8 million, excluding closing costs.

FFO available for common shareholders is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is net income available for common shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties and its proportionate share of the real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint venture properties and the difference between FFO attributable to an equity investment and equity in earnings of an equity investee but excluding impairment charges on and increases in the carrying value of real estate assets, any gain or loss on sale of real estate, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to GOV. GOV's calculation of Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differs from Nareit's definition of FFO available for common shareholders because GOV includes Select Income REIT's, or SIR's, Normalized FFO attributable to GOV's equity investment in SIR (net of FFO attributable to GOV's equity investment in SIR), GOV includes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of GOV's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year and GOV excludes unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. GOV considers FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income available for GOV's common shareholders and operating income. GOV believes that FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders may facilitate a comparison of GOV's operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders are among the factors considered by GOV's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to GOV's shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain GOV's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in GOV's credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to GOV of debt and equity capital, GOV's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance, GOV's receipt of distributions from SIR and GOV's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income, net income available for common shareholders or operating income as indicators of GOV's operating performance or as measures of GOV's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income available for common shareholders and operating income as presented in GOV's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differently than GOV does.\n(2)\nIncentive fees under GOV’s business management agreement with The RMR Group LLC are payable after the end of each calendar year, are calculated based on common share total return, as defined, and are included in general and administrative expenses in GOV’s condensed consolidated statements of income. In calculating net income in accordance with GAAP, GOV recognizes estimated business management incentive fee expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters. Although GOV recognizes this expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters for purposes of calculating net income, GOV does not include such expense in the calculation of Normalized FFO until the fourth quarter, when the amount of the business management incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if any, is determined. Net income includes $2,887 of estimated business management incentive fee expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(3)\nUnrealized gain on equity securities represents the adjustment required to adjust the carrying value of GOV's investment in The RMR Group Inc. common shares to its fair value as of March 31, 2018 in accordance with new GAAP standards effective January 1, 2018.\nGovernment Properties Income Trust\nCalculation and Reconciliation of Consolidated Property Net Operating Income (NOI) and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI (1)\n(amounts in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Calculation of Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI (2) : Rental income (3) $ 108,717 $ 69,296 Property operating expenses (42,491 ) (26,775 ) Consolidated Property NOI 66,226 42,521 Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (3,091 ) (1,300 ) Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 835 627 Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI $ 63,849 $ 41,727 Reconciliation of Net Income Available for Common Shareholders to Consolidated NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI: Net income available for common shareholders $ 6,287 $ 7,415 Preferred units of limited partnership distributions 278 — Net income 6,565 7,415 Loss from discontinued operations — 144 Income from continuing operations 6,565 7,559 Equity in earnings of investees (9,712 ) (2,739 ) Income tax expense 32 18 Interest expense 22,766 13,581 Interest income (116 ) (61 ) Unrealized gain on equity securities (12,931 ) — Dividend income (304 ) (304 ) Operating income 6,300 18,054 General and administrative 9,606 3,962 Loss on impairment of real estate 6,116 — Depreciation and amortization 44,204 20,505 Consolidated Property NOI 66,226 42,521 Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 835 627 Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (3,091 ) (1,300 ) Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI $ 63,849 $ 41,727 Reconciliation of Consolidated Property NOI to Same Property NOI (5) : Rental income $ 108,717 $ 69,296 Property operating expenses (42,491 ) (26,775 ) Consolidated Property NOI 66,226 42,521 Less: NOI of properties not included in same property results (24,679 ) (470 ) Same property NOI $ 41,547 $ 42,051 Calculation of Same Property Cash Basis NOI (5) : Same property NOI $ 41,547 $ 42,051 Add: Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 531 616 Less: Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (633 ) (1,267 ) Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (118 ) Same property Cash Basis NOI $ 41,324 $ 41,282 (1)\nGOV calculates Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI as shown above. The calculations of Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income available for common shareholders in order to provide results that are more closely related to GOV's consolidated property level results of operations. GOV defines Consolidated Property NOI as consolidated income from its rental of real estate less its consolidated property operating expenses. Consolidated Property NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that GOV records as depreciation and amortization. GOV defines Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI as Consolidated Property NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization and non-cash amortization included in other operating expenses. GOV considers Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income available for common shareholders because they may help both investors and management to understand the operations of GOV's consolidated properties. GOV uses Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide consolidated property level performance, and GOV believes that Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI provide useful information to investors regarding GOV's results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of GOV's operating performance between periods and with other REITs. Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income, net income available for common shareholders or operating income as indicators of GOV's operating performance or as measures of its liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income available for common shareholders and operating income as presented in GOV's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI differently than GOV does.\n(2)\nExcludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations which was sold on August 31, 2017.\n(3)\nGOV reports rental income on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases; as a result, rental income includes non-cash straight line rent adjustments. Rental income also includes expense reimbursements, tax escalations, parking revenues, service income and other fixed and variable charges paid to GOV by its tenants, as well as the net effect of non-cash amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities. (4)\nGOV recorded a liability for the amount by which the estimated fair value for accounting purposes exceeded the price GOV paid for its investment in The RMR Group Inc. common stock in June 2015. A portion of this liability is being amortized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2035 as a reduction to property management fees expense, which is included in property operating expenses.\n(5)\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI are based on consolidated properties GOV owned as of March 31, 2018 and which it owned continuously since January 1, 2017.\nGovernment Properties Income Trust\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(amounts in thousands, except share data)\n(unaudited)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 ASSETS Real estate properties: Land $ 623,610 $ 627,108 Buildings and improvements 2,313,123 2,348,613 Total real estate properties, gross 2,936,733 2,975,721 Accumulated depreciation (353,329 ) (341,848 ) Total real estate properties, net 2,583,404 2,633,873 Equity investment in Select Income REIT 465,131 467,499 Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 48,758 50,202 Assets of properties held for sale 18,080 — Acquired real estate leases, net 323,710 351,872 Cash and cash equivalents 17,380 16,569 Restricted cash 4,766 3,111 Rents receivable, net 65,539 61,429 Deferred leasing costs, net 22,622 22,977 Other assets, net 106,234 96,033 Total assets $ 3,655,624 $ 3,703,565 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Unsecured revolving credit facility $ 570,000 $ 570,000 Unsecured term loans, net 548,022 547,852 Senior unsecured notes, net 944,743 944,140 Mortgage notes payable, net 182,083 183,100 Liabilities of properties held for sale 275 — Accounts payable and other liabilities 74,623 89,440 Due to related persons 8,544 4,859 Assumed real estate lease obligations, net 12,480 13,635 Total liabilities 2,340,770 2,353,026 Commitments and contingencies Preferred units of limited partnership 20,496 20,496 Shareholders’ equity: Common shares of beneficial interest, $.01 par value: 150,000,000 shares authorized, 99,145,304 and 99,145,921 shares issued and outstanding, respectively 991 991 Additional paid in capital 1,968,205 1,968,217 Cumulative net income 174,585 108,144 Cumulative other comprehensive income 945 60,427 Cumulative common distributions (850,368 ) (807,736 ) Total shareholders’ equity 1,294,358 1,330,043 shareholders’ equity $ 3,655,624 $ 3,703,565 A Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust with transferable shares of beneficial interest listed on the Nasdaq.\nNo shareholder, Trustee or officer is personally liable for any act or obligation of the Trust.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005378/en/\nGovernment Properties Income Trust\nChristopher Ranjitkar, 617-219-1410\nDirector, Investor Relations\nSource: Government Properties Income Trust", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005378/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.govreit.com&esheet=51800286&newsitemid=20180503005378&lan=en-US&anchor=www.govreit.com&index=2&md5=3b97f1502963055e3f0f0e09456bcefc", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2FWWW.SEC.GOV&esheet=51800286&newsitemid=20180503005378&lan=en-US&anchor=WWW.SEC.GOV&index=3&md5=d22a8098c8eb0d32ba95377fb4a26b3f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.govreit.com&esheet=51800286&newsitemid=20180503005378&lan=en-US&anchor=www.govreit.com&index=1&md5=92a035b31ca5de4ce87193263c21006f"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:38:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
