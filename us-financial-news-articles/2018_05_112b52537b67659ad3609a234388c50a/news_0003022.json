(Nasdaq:PRGX), a global leader in Recovery Audit and Spend Analytics services, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“The year is off to a great start with continued momentum and our seventh straight quarter of year-over-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Revenue in the first quarter grew over 9% and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations grew over 52%. Our core recovery audit business led the way, delivering growth across each region and service line. While we continue to make strategic investments in people, processes and technology, our growth in adjusted EBITDA is a testament to our past investments and the benefits of scale in our operating model,” said Ron Stewart, president and chief executive officer.\n“We entered the second quarter with a solid sales pipeline across the business, driven by stronger technology solutions and improved go-to-market capabilities, which together have made us more competitive across the globe. Given our overall positive performance in the quarter, we remain confident in our 2018 guidance of year-over-year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 17% to 22%,\" concluded Stewart.\nConsolidated Results from Continuing Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nConsolidated revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $36.7 million, compared to $33.6 million for the same period last year, an increase of 9.4%. First quarter 2018 revenue from the Recovery Audit Services segments was $36.0 million compared to $32.2 million in the prior year, and from the Adjacent Services segment was $0.7 million compared to $1.4 million in 2017. On a constant dollar basis adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue increased by 5.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year. On a constant dollar basis, revenue from the Recovery Audit Services segments increased 8.1% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nTotal cost of revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.8 million, or 67.6% of revenue, compared to $23.0 million, or 68.5% of revenue, in the same period last year, representing a 0.9% improvement as a percentage of revenue.\nSG&A expenses from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 were $11.3 million, compared to $10.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to stock- based compensation expense and investments in our sales, marketing and product development teams.\nConsolidated net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $(2.3) million, or $(0.10) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(1.8) million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.3 million, or 9.0% of revenue, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million, or 6.4% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.1 million or 52.0%. Schedule 3 attached to this press release provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to each of EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nNet cash used in operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.0 million, compared to net cash used of $3.3 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter 2018 use of operating cash included the payout of $5.4 million related to performance based restricted stock units granted in 2016. Excluding this payout, cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 million, an improvement of $5.8 million compared to the prior year.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $15.0 million, and borrowings of $13.6 million against its $35.0 million revolving credit facility.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Call\nAs previously announced, management will hold a conference call later today at 5:00 PM (Eastern time) to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results.

Such statements include both implied and express statements regarding the Company's overall condition and growth prospects, the Company's execution of its business strategy, the benefits of past investments and scale in the Company’s operating model, the Company’s sales pipeline, and the Company's expectations regarding its 2018 financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to differ materially from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Risks that could affect the Company's future performance include revenue that does not meet expectations or justify costs incurred, the Company's ability to develop material sources of new revenue in addition to revenue from its core recovery audit services, changes in the market for the Company's services, the Company's ability to retain and attract qualified personnel, the Company's ability to integrate recent and future acquisitions, uncertainty in the credit markets, the Company's ability to maintain compliance with its financial covenants, client bankruptcies, loss of major clients, and other risks generally applicable to the Company's business.

They are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.

In addition, a measure similar to Adjusted EBITDA is used in the restrictive covenants contained in the Company's secured credit facility. However, EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. In addition, in evaluating EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, as described above, the adjustments may vary from period to period and in the future the Company will incur expenses such as those used in calculating these measures. The Company's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Schedule 3 to this press release provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to each of EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nCONTACT: PRGX Global, Inc.\ninvestor-relations@prgx.com\nPhone: 770-779-3011\nSCHEDULE 1 PRGX Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue $ 36,721 $ 33,569 Operating expenses: Cost of revenue 24,797 23,026 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11,264 10,535 Depreciation of property and equipment 1,223 1,220 Amortization of intangible assets 788 722 Total operating expenses 38,072 35,503 Operating income (loss) (1,351 ) (1,934 ) Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses on short-term intercompany balances (220 ) (552 ) Interest expense (income), net 398 37 Other (income) loss 12 (199 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (1,541 ) (1,220 ) Income tax expense 787 627 Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ (2,328 ) $ (1,847 ) Discontinued operations: Income (loss) from discontinued operations (333 ) (336 ) Other (income) loss - - Income tax expense (benefit) - - Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (333 ) (336 ) Net income (loss) $ (2,661 ) $ (2,183 ) Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Basic from continuing operations (0.10 ) (0.08 ) Basic from discontinued operations (0.01 ) (0.02 ) Total basic earnings (loss) per common share (0.11 ) (0.10 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Diluted from continuing operations (0.10 ) (0.08 ) Diluted from discontinued operations (0.01 ) (0.02 ) Total diluted earnings (loss) per common share (0.11 ) (0.10 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 22,573 21,945 Diluted 22,573 21,945\nSCHEDULE 2 PRGX Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Amounts in thousands) (Unaudited) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 14,948 $ 18,823 Restricted cash 112 51 Receivables: Contract receivables, net 32,579 38,767 Employee advances and miscellaneous receivables, net 1,748 1,665 Total receivables 34,327 40,432 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4,163 4,608 Total current assets 53,550 63,914 Property and equipment, net 18,824 17,478 Goodwill 17,691 17,648 Intangible assets, net 17,785 18,478 Deferred income taxes 1,322 1,538 Other assets 1,446 1,162 Total assets $ 110,618 $ 120,218 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 7,028 $ 8,548 Accrued payroll and related expenses 9,067 13,078 Refund liabilities 8,032 7,864 Deferred revenue 1,741 1,431 Current portion of long-term debt 48 48 Current portion of long-term incentive compensation liability 914 5,116 Current portion of business acquisition obligations 3,843 3,759 Total current liabilities 30,673 39,844 Long-term debt 13,534 13,526 Business acquisition obligations 5,263 5,135 Refund liabilities 923 957 Other long-term liabilities 424 442 Total liabilities 50,817 59,904 Shareholders' equity: Common stock 231 224 Additional paid-in capital 581,898 580,032 Accumulated deficit (522,710 ) (520,049 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 382 107 Total shareholders' equity 59,801 60,314 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 110,618 $ 120,218\nSCHEDULE 3 PRGX Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Amounts in thousands) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss $ (2,661 ) $ (2,183 ) Income tax expense 787 627 Interest expense, net 398 37 EBIT (1,476 ) (1,519 ) Depreciation of property and equipment 1,224 1,220 Amortization of intangible assets 788 722 EBITDA 536 423 Foreign currency transaction gains on short-term intercompany balances (220 ) (552 ) Transformation severance and related expenses 674 585 Other loss (income) 12 (199 ) Stock-based compensation 1,945 1,566 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,947 $ 1,823 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 3,279 $ 2,157 Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations $ (332 ) $ (334 ) EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are all \"non-GAAP financial measures\" presented as supplemental measures of our performance.
