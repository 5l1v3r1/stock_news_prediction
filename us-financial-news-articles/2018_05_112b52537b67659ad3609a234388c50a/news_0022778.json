But some of its smaller partners pushed for a meeting to discuss Dalic’s situation, to which the HDZ agreed.\nThe coalition agreed to meet again next Tuesday.\n“We will talk about how the settlement process is going. The key thing now is to save jobs and reach settlement. Political responsibility will remain the topic in the coming days and also once the settlement has been reached,” Ivan Vrdoljak, head of the junior coalition partner HNS, said after the meeting.\nDarinko Kosor from the liberal HSLS party said that Plenkovic had the support of his partners but that any allegations of graft must be looked into.\n“The parliamentary majority is not in jeopardy. I expect the settlement to be reached on schedule, but also I expect the relevant bodies to investigate if anyone has made an unlawful gain in (Agrokor’s) restructuring process,” he said.\nThe coalition’s 77 deputies give it only a small majority in the 151-seat parliament.\nThe opposition, led by the Social Democrats and the center-right Most “Bridge” party, has previously targeted Dalic over Agrokor, and she survived a no-confidence vote in parliament last month.\nAgrokor’s creditors, which include foreign and local banks, agreed on debt settlement terms last month, which they must approve in a vote before July 10 to prevent the firm from going bankrupt.\nReporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:29:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
