However, atop Ludgate Hill, in the very heart of the metropolis, stands Wren’s greatest achievement, St. Paul’s Cathedral. The seat of London’s bishop and scene of many royal celebrations, St. Paul’s has stood more than one test under fire.\nOn Dec. 29, 1940, a German air raid dropped 28 incendiary bombs on the cathedral and its precincts. At the height of the raid, Prime Minister Winston Churchill insisted that St. Paul’s take priority that night above all other burning buildings as a symbol of Britain’s will to survive. The great dome did survive that attack and a direct hit the following April, by which time it had achieved preternatural symbolism, towering above the surrounding ruins. Just as it withstood the Blitz, so had Wren’s masterpiece literally risen from the ashes of its medieval predecessor, Old St. Paul’s, completed in 1314 and seriously damaged in London’s Great Fire of 1666.\nAt least the fourth cathedral built on that site since the seventh century, Old St. Paul’s had been England’s longest cathedral and was dominated by a central tower, a traditional feature of most English Gothic cathedrals. By Wren’s time the tower, roughly 260 feet high, was thought to be in danger of collapse. Therefore, even before the fire, Wren proposed replacing it with a feature unprecedented in England—a dome. The cathedral’s west front had already been given a novel Classical-style façade by Wren’s great architectural predecessor, Inigo Jones (1573-1652). Though part of the old building was patched up after the fire, it was still considered unsafe.\nIn 1668, Wren was officially informed that Old St. Paul’s would not be salvaged but replaced. Though seven more years would pass before the foundation stone was laid, Wren’s new cathedral would be England’s first built since the Reformation and its first non-Gothic one. Moreover, as all medieval English cathedrals had been converted from Roman Catholic worship, this one was the first to be purpose-built for Protestant Anglicanism. Its construction took some three decades and exposed Wren to myriad problems and indignities.\nToday, St. Paul’s presents an architectural majesty born of Wren’s inventive approach to Classical style: For instance, while the central two-story colonnade framing the main entrance may remind the viewer of a Greco-Roman temple, with its triangular pediment and sculptural tympanum, those two stories of Corinthian columns—grouped in pairs rather than evenly spaced—represent Classicism interpreted through a Baroque sensibility. Yet this monument to Baroque Classicism is actually constructed upon a Gothic cruciform footprint—a long central nave running from west to east intersected by a transept. Inside the cathedral, the nave flanked by great stone piers and parallel side aisles, and the clerestory windows above the aisles, are, in fact, all traditional Gothic elements. Moreover, Wren’s weight-bearing walls demanded Gothic-style flying buttresses, which would have looked incongruous amid his Classicism. So he concealed them behind the high screen walls that form the building’s long north and south façades—the buttresses are visible only from above the building. From the street, the screen walls also conceal the clerestory windows that admit daylight to the nave—they are visible only from inside the church.\nCertainly St. Paul’s most conspicuous and most glorious external feature is the great dome, seated upon its colonnaded drum and topped by a soaring cupola. Declared “one of the most perfect domes in the world” by the revered architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, it is the primary symbol of Wren’s genius and encloses a shallower inner dome, whose murals by James Thornhill ( William Hogarth’s father-in-law) are what visitors see from the cathedral floor.\nAlthough the massive pillars, spreading fan vaulting and hammer beams of Gothic church interiors reveal how great Medieval buildings support themselves, Wren—generally no fan of the Gothic—wished to conceal the structural elements of his architectural scheme. When standing inside St. Paul’s, at the cathedral crossing beneath the inner dome, we are surrounded by four groups of massive Corinthian pilasters. Although these appear to support the structure, in fact structurally the continuous stone supports soar upward behind plain stone facings, beyond the gilded capitals and the glowing 19th-century mosaic spandrels executed by the Venetian glass firm of Salviati, right up to the “whispering gallery.”\n“Architecture aims at eternity,” said Wren, who by the time he died in 1723 had designed in total or in part 56 churches in and around London. But he is buried in the crypt of St. Paul’s. After World War II, a bronze roundel was set into the cathedral floor, directly below the mighty dome. It is inscribed with a simple Latin epitaph, which translates as: “Beneath lie the remains of the builder of this church and city, Christopher Wren, who lived beyond ninety years, not for his own profit but for the public good. Reader, if you seek his monument—look around you.”\n—Mr. Scherer writes about music and the fine arts for the Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T19:44:32.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
