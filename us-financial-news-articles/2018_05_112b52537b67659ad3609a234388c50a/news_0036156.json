Pope Francis speaks during the Wednesday general audience in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican, May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi\n“I express my great pain for the dead and wounded and I am close in prayer and affection to all those who are suffering,” he told tens of thousands of people at his general audience in St. Peter’s Square.\n“I repeat that the use of violence never leads to peace. War begets war and violence begets violence.”\nIsraeli forces killed 60 Palestinians near the Gaza-Israel border on Monday during demonstrations against the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, in the bloodiest day in Gaza in years.\nFrancis, who visited Israel and Palestinian territories in 2014, asked both sides and the international community to redouble efforts “so that dialogue, justice and peace prevail”.\nLast December, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced the decision to move the embassy, Francis called for Jerusalem’s “status quo” to be respected, saying new tension in the Middle East would further inflame world conflicts.\nSpeaking earlier in the audience to a group of Polish World War Two veterans, he said: “We never learn.” A Palestinian shouts slogans as others throw stones towards the Israeli embassy during a demonstration against the recent killings of Palestinian protesters on the Gaza-Israel border and the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem, in Athens, Greece, May 15, 2018.
