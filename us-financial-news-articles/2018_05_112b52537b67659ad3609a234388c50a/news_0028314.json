(NASDAQ:FCSC), a gene therapy company focused on transformational autologous cell-based therapies for skin and connective tissue diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and recent operational highlights. Fibrocell will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n“Our achievements in the first quarter of 2018 have set the stage for continued progress of Fibrocell’s gene therapy clinical programs that address rare conditions of the skin and connective tissue with high unmet needs,” said John Maslowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fibrocell. “In January, we obtained allowance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enroll pediatric patients in the Phase 2 portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007 for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. In addition, the Phase 1 portion of this trial continued to advance and we expect to report additional interim adult data in the second quarter of 2018.”\n“Furthermore, our FCX-013 program for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma made important progress. In March 2018, Fibrocell was granted allowance by the FDA of the Investigational New Drug Application for FCX-013 to proceed to clinical trials,” said Mr. Maslowski.\nRecent program highlights and new updates are as follows:\nFCX-007\nFibrocell obtained allowance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate enrollment of pediatric patients in the Phase 2 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007, based on evidence of safety and potential benefit of FCX-007 in adult patients dosed in the Phase 1 portion of the clinical trial. Fibrocell plans to enroll six patients ages seven and older in the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial. One recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) adult patient has been enrolled in Phase 2, and dosing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018. Fibrocell expects to report additional interim data on the adult patients in the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007 and provide a trial update in the second quarter of 2018, which includes an oral presentation at the 7 th International Investigative Dermatology meeting on May 19, 2018. Fibrocell expects to complete enrollment of patients in the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007 in the third quarter of 2018. Another interim data report and trial update is expected in the first quarter of 2019.\nFCX-013\nFibrocell obtained FDA allowance of the Investigational New Drug Application for FCX-013 to progress to clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. Fibrocell expects to initiate enrollment for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-013 in the third quarter of 2018.\nCorporate\nOn April 18, 2018, Fibrocell announced that its Board of Directors is conducting a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. Fibrocell has engaged Canaccord Genuity LLC as its strategic financial advisor to assist with this review process. The Board of Directors has established a Special Committee to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives which may include a sale of the Company, a business combination, a merger or reverse merger with another company, a strategic investment into the Company, a sale, license or other disposition of corporate assets of the Company or continuing with the current business plan. Fibrocell has not set a timetable for completion of the review process. No decision has been made as to whether the Company will engage in a transaction or transactions, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction, or the terms or timing of any potential transaction.\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Fibrocell reported a diluted net loss of $0.11 per share, compared to a diluted net loss of $0.60 per share for the same period in 2017.\nThe 2018 period included approximately $0.2 million of non-cash warrant revaluation income, as compared to approximately $0.1 million of non-cash warrant revaluation expense for the same period in 2017. Additionally, the 2018 period included non-cash deemed dividends on Series A preferred stock of approximately $0.1 million as compared to the approximately $3.7 million in non-cash deemed dividends included in the 2017 period, increasing the net loss attributable to common stockholders.\nResearch and development expenses decreased 54.9% to approximately $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to approximately $3.0 million for the same three-month period in 2017. This decrease was due primarily to decreased costs for our FCX-007 program of approximately $1.3 million, or 105.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. These decreased costs were primarily the result of transitioning from dosing of adult patients and analysis of data in the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial to recruitment for the Phase 2 portion of the trial, and moving our manufacturing operations in-house from a third party contractor. Costs for our FCX-013 program decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 59.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease was related primarily to decreased costs from our clinical partner Intrexon Corporation of approximately $0.4 million, as substantially all of the costs of the pre-clinical phase of the project were incurred at the end of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.7% to approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to approximately $1.5 million for the same three-month period in 2017. This increase was due primarily to the credits for stock compensation expense recorded in the 2017 period, due to the forfeiture of stock options by prior management that left the Company in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $12.2 million and working capital of approximately $10.8 million. Fibrocell used approximately $4.8 million in cash for operations during both of the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.\nConference Call and Webcast\nTo participate on the live call, please dial 866-548-4713 (domestic) or +1-323-794-2093 (international), and provide the conference code 3897293 five to ten minutes before the start of the call.
