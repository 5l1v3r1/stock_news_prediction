Anyone found guilty could be jailed for up to 10 years.\n“The companies that we have filed charges against don’t have a quota to import even a single ton of electronic waste,” Wirachai said.\nChina imposed a ban on overseas trash last year, telling the World Trade Organization (WTO) that it would stop accepting imports on 24 types of foreign waste, leading some to fear that the waste could end up in neighboring countries.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\nThe ban has upended the world’s waste handling supply chain and caused massive pile-ups of trash from Asia to Europe, as exporters struggled to find new buyers for the garbage.\nAccording to estimates in China’s state media last year, more than 70 percent of the world’s 500 million tonnes of electronic waste entered China in 2016.\nEnvironmentalists say waste once destined for China is being re-routed to Southeast Asia, and new laws are needed or existing laws better enforced to prevent illegal imports.\n“Especially after China’s ban, Thailand could become one of the biggest dumping grounds for e-waste,” said Penchom Saetang, director of Ecological Alert and Recovery Thailand (EARTH).\nThailand ratified in 1997 the Basel Convention, which aims to control trans-boundary movements of hazardous waste. But the convention does not completely prohibit these exports from more developed to less developed countries.\n“The Basel Convention cannot prevent what is happening in Thailand because it has its limitations,” Penchon said in calling for an amendment that would ban these shipments. Slideshow (8 Images)\nThai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha vowed this week to step up nationwide inspections as part of a plan to combat illegal electronic waste. But environmentalists say they have not seen the details of how it will work.\n“It isn’t clear how he will do this,” said Penchom.
