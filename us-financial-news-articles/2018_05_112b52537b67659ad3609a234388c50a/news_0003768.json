A level below 100 percent indicates an underwriting profit.\nThe average premium paid for motor insurance in Britain jumped 9 percent in 2017 to the highest level since 2012, the Association of British Insurers said.\nPremiums rose for most of last year, partly in response to new rules for personal injury claims.
