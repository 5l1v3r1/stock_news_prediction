We also completed two equity financings, increased our manufacturing capabilities, and substantially expanded our team. For the remainder of 2018, we anticipate data or milestones from many of our clinical programs and are planning to launch our first commercial product in Hong Kong. We look forward to continuing our momentum towards becoming a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, by progressing and expanding our R&D pipeline and in-house discovery efforts.”\nRecent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nZL-2306\nRecently submitted market registration application for ZL-2306 in Hong Kong, relying on approval status in the US and EU. Zai Lab plans to commercialize ZL-2306 in Hong Kong in the second half of 2018, and in Macau thereafter.\nIn September 2017, Zai Lab dosed the first patient in its Phase 3 China registration trial of ZL-2306 as a second-line maintenance therapy in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Zai Lab also expects to initiate a second Phase 3 China registration trial of ZL-2306 as a first-line maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-responsive ovarian cancer in mid-2018.\nIn November 2017, Zai Lab initiated a pharmacokinetic (PK) study to establish the PK profile of ZL-2306 in Chinese patients. Enrollment is completed, with data anticipated by mid-2018.\nFPA 144\nIn December 2017, Zai Lab in-licensed exclusive regional rights to FPA 144 from Five Prime Therapeutics. FPA 144 is a targeted immuno-therapy for tumors that overexpress FGFR2b, such as gastric and gastro-esophageal junction cancer. Zai Lab has submitted the CTA and plans to conduct the China portion of the global Phase I/III registrational program later this year.\nZL-2301\nIn the second quarter of 2017, Zai Lab initiated a Phase II trial of ZL-2301 as a second-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular cancer patients in China. To date, preliminary anti-tumor activity has been observed in patients treated with ZL-2301, and the drug appears to be generally well-tolerated. Phase II data from the trial are expected in the second half of 2018. Pending positive results, Zai Lab plans to start a Phase III registration trial thereafter.\nZL-2401\nIn April 2017, Zai Lab in-licensed exclusive regional rights to ZL-2401, a broad spectrum antibiotic, from Paratek Pharmaceuticals. Zai Lab has completed the technology transfer and is engaged in discussions with the SDA and key opinion leaders on Zai Lab’s planned China development strategy in preparation for an NDA filing. In the US, an NDA was submitted for ZL-2401 in February 2018, and the drug is under priority review with a PDUFA date in October 2018.\nETX2514\nZai Lab entered in to an exclusive licensing agreement and collaboration with Entasis Therapeutics for ETX2514 on April 25, 2018. ETX2514 is a novel broad-spectrum β-lactamases inhibitor and is expected to move into global Phase III clinical trials in the first quarter of 2019. Zai Lab will manage the China portion of the Phase III clinical trials.\nZL-3101\nZai Lab initiated a Phase II study of ZL-3101 in eczema patients in China during the second quarter of 2017. Topline results from the Phase II study are expected to be available in the second half of 2018. Pending positive results, Zai Lab plans to start a Phase III registration trial thereafter.\nInternal Discovery Programs\nWith its in-house discovery efforts over the past two years, Zai Lab continues to focus on exploring immunotherapy and targeted approaches to treating cancer.\nCorporate Development\nZai Lab continued to strengthen its financial position. In June 2017, Zai Lab completed a $30 million Series C financing and in September 2017, Zai Lab completed its upsized public offering of American depositary shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $172.5 million. This additional capital, in addition to other cash on hand, is expected to provide Zai Lab with at least a 24-month runway.\nIn anticipation of commercialization of ZL-2306 in Hong Kong and other territories, Zai Lab has built a small molecule commercial drug production facility in Suzhou, China. Zai Lab is also nearing completion of a biologic pilot plant using GE’s FlexFactory Platform that is capable of producing product at 1,000L scale.\nSince the date of the initial public offering last September, Zai Lab has doubled its personnel size, including several senior and key hires, and expects to have over 200 employees by the end of 2018.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $229.7 million.\nResearch and development expenses were $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $32.1 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher clinical and preclinical costs, and expansion of research efforts to support internal programs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses due to increased headcount as Zai Lab expanded its operations, and increased costs associated with operating as a public company.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Zai Lab reported a net loss of $50.4 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.32, compared to a net loss of $37.5 million, or basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $3.97, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nZai Lab will host a live conference call and webcast today, May 2, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to review its financial results and provide a general business update.\nThe live webcast can be accessed by visiting the Investors section of Zai Lab’s website at http://ir.zailaboratory.com .
