She was due to return to Pakistan on June 9.\n“I have no words to express my feelings,” family friend Mohammad Ali said after the coffin arrived at the family home. “It is a great loss to Pakistan. She wanted to do a lot for this country.”\nWriting by Saad Sayeed; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T10:51:05.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
