No details were provided in line with EU policy. It will decide by May 30 whether to clear the bid after getting feedback from third parties.\nThe company offered to sell its premium pay TV film channel Film1 and scrapped clauses which restrict broadcasters’ ability to sell their channels and content over the internet.\nThe Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, in October last year rejected the Commission’s ruling because it had failed to properly explain the effects of the merger on the market for pay TV sports channels.\nLiberty Global has since joined forces with Vodafone ( VOD.L ) in the Netherlands to create VodafoneZiggo.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T14:15:11.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
