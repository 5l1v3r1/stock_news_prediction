Stewart went to a federal prison for five months because of that crime.\nTechnically speaking, Stewart was not convicted of perjury, which is lying under oath.\nInstead, she was convicted of making false statements to federal investigators, as well as obstruction of justice.\nAnd federal prosecutors can charge people with making false statements during an interview even if the thing being lied about is not a crime.\n\"When you go in there, you're going to have to tell the truth,\" said John Marston, a former federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.\nThe interview stalemate The risk for Trump, who has a tendency to talk at length and to make contradictory statements, running afoul of that guidance, has been on the minds of his lawyers since Mueller's probe began last year.\nSince then, they had sought, through negotiations with Mueller, to limit what Trump would be asked about, and the duration of any interview he gives.\nGiuliani, during a meeting with Mueller about two weeks ago, discussed the possibility of Trump answering written questions submitted by the special prosecutor.\nBut Mueller rejected that offer from Trump's legal team, Giuliani told NBC News.\nTweet\nThat leaves Mueller still asking for a face-to-face interview.\nLast week, Trump said, \"I would love\" to do that interview.\n\"Nothing I want to do more,\" Trump said. But he quickly added that he first needs to \"find that we're going to be treated fairly because everybody sees it now and it's a pure witch hunt.\"\nSubpoena power through history If Trump ends up refusing to voluntarily talk to Mueller, \"this whole thing gets more interesting if Mueller's team issues a subpoena,\" which would seek to compel the president to submit to questioning, Marston said.\nGiuliani has recently said that a subpoena — which Mueller reportedly suggested was possible during a meeting with Trump's lawyers in March — would be a non-starter.\n\"We don't have to comply with a potential Mueller subpoena,\" Giuliani told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"He's the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.\"\nBut Marston said that claim is just wrong.\n\"Every time a president has been subpoenaed, it's been upheld or it's effectively served its purpose,\" Marston said.\nVice President Aaron Burr, when he was on trial for treason in 1807, issued a subpoena for a letter sent to President Thomas Jefferson related to the alleged conspiracy involving Burr.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall approved that subpoena. Jefferson refused to comply, at first, but he ended up giving Marshall some information about the letter that satisfied the justice.\nIn 1974, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ordered President Richard Nixon to turn over tape recordings and other items in response to a subpoena issued by Leon Jaworski, the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.\nAnd more than two decades later, the Supreme Court rejected President Bill Clinton 's effort to resist being subpoenaed for his testimony in a sexual-harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones.\nClinton's lie denying his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in that subsequent deposition led to him being impeached in 1998. Clinton was acquitted, however, in the Senate.\nPleading the Fifth Brennan, the former Manhattan prosecutor, said that if Trump is ultimately subpoenaed by Mueller, \"You go into it with the ability to plead the Fifth.\"\nThe Constitution's Fifth Amendment prevents an individual being compelled to give testimony against himself.\n\"I would tell Mueller, 'I'm not answering any of your questions,' \" Brennan said.\nGerald Lefcourt, a New York City criminal defense lawyer who battled against then-prosecutor Giuliani in a high-profile municipal corruption trial in the 1980s, said he believes his former adversary \"seems to be setting up a Fifth Amendment response to a subpoena.\"\nLefcourt noted Giuliani's comments about Mueller's probe, which include calling it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\"There's no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,\" Giuliani said on ABC on Sunday. \"I happen to believe it's greater than anybody realizes. Very embarrassing to my former Justice Department.\"\nLefcourt said comments like that could be used to justify having a sitting American president plead the Fifth Amendment.\n\"If the government is so bad, and out of control, asserting the Fifth is not because you fear you've done something wrong, but rather a way of protecting yourself from being set up by unfair prosecutors,\" Lefcourt said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T22:39:35.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
