The government will add 684 million reais ($195 million) to the program’s budget to cover the increase.\nThe Family Grant, a lauded welfare program that has been copied by several developing nations, currently gives impoverished families a monthly allowance of up to 336 reais ($103). It is also seen as an important tool to curry favor with poor and working class voters, especially heading into October’s general election.\nThe government said in November it planned to increase the welfare program’s budget, which around 14 million families receive.
