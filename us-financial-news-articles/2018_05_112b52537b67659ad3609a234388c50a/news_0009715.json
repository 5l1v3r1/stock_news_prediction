Adjusted net income 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006512/en/\nCRC 1Q 2018 Earnings Infographic (Graphic: Business Wire)\nAdjusted EBITDAX 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $250 million and cash provided by operating activities was $200 million. Capital investments were $139 million.\nQuarterly Highlights Include:\nProduced 123,000 BOE per day, above the midpoint of the guidance range Invested capital of $139 million Drilled 44 wells with internally funded capital and 30 wells with joint venture (JV) capital Generated adjusted EBITDAX 1 of $250 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDAX margin 1 of 41%\n2018 Outlook:\nIncreased 2018 capital budget to a range of $550 million to $600 million, with approximately $100 to $150 million funded by JV partners BSP and Macquarie Incremental capital directed to drilling, workover and facilities projects in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins Second quarter of 2018 production guidance of 131,000 to 136,000 BOE per day, reflecting a 2,000 BOE per day negative impact due to production sharing contracts (PSC) effects utilizing first quarter of 2018 price levels Second quarter of 2018 production forecast is flat with first quarter of 2018 production levels, adjusted for the PSC effect and excluding the Elk Hills acquisition production Production from Elk Hills acquired interests for second quarter of 2018 projected at approximately 11,600 BOE per day, reflecting transition mechanics. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company expects approximately 12,000 BOE per day contribution from acquired Elk Hills interests\nTodd A. Stevens, CRC's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"With our midstream joint venture and recent transaction to consolidate our interest in our flagship Elk Hills field, CRC is off to a strong start in 2018. Supported by increasing cash flow and a clear runway to execute, we are well-positioned for a mid-cycle commodity price environment. As our first quarter results and second quarter guidance show, we have confidence that we have arrested the decline in our production, excluding PSC impacts. We increased our capital program to target the next phase of development and further delineate growth areas. We will see associated production growth later this year and into 2019. Our top priorities remain centered on value-oriented growth and cash margin expansion, as we allocate capital to capture the full potential of our assets and deliver lasting value for our shareholders.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the CRC net loss was $2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and adjusted net income 1 was $8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. Adjusted net income 1 excluded $7 million of non-cash derivatives losses and a $2 million charge for severance costs.\nTotal daily production volumes averaged 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day for the first quarter of 2018. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, first quarter production was reduced by 2,400 BOE per day due to PSC effects from higher prices. Excluding PSC effects, sequential production was essentially flat. For the first quarter of 2018, oil volumes averaged 77,000 barrels per day, NGL volumes averaged 16,000 barrels per day and gas volumes averaged 182,000 thousand cubic feet (MCF) per day. First quarter results reflect a residual 400 BOE per day negative impact due to the 2017 California wildfires and subsequent mudslides. The impact of PSC effect relative to guidance was a small negative amount.\nRealized crude oil prices, including the effect of settled hedges, increased by $12.53 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018 to $62.77 per barrel from the prior year comparable period. Settled hedges decreased realized crude oil prices by $4.49 per barrel. Average realized NGL prices continued to be strong and registered $43.13 per barrel, reflecting a realized price that was 64% of Brent prices. Realized natural gas prices were $2.81 per MCF.\nProduction costs for the first quarter of 2018 were $212 million, essentially flat with the $211 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a per unit basis, first quarter production costs of $19.08 per BOE were higher than the comparable prior year period of $17.70 per BOE, due to lower production. First quarter unit production costs were lower than previously disclosed guidance levels, reflecting continued cost reductions and efficiency, as well as timing of activities, across most cost categories. The industry practice for reporting PSCs can result in higher production costs per barrel as gross field operating costs are matched with net production. Excluding the PSC effects, per unit production costs 1 for the first quarter of 2018 would have been $17.47. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $63 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and consistent with the prior year comparable period. These costs were also lower than the guidance range for the period due to the timing of certain corporate expenses.\nCRC reported taxes other than on income of $38 million, $5 million higher than the prior year period primarily due to the increase in market prices for greenhouse gas allowances, among other factors. Exploration expense of $8 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased $2 million from the prior year comparable period, demonstrating the Company's commitment to the exploration opportunities within its large asset portfolio.\nCapital investment in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $139 million, excluding JV capital. Approximately $94 million was directed to drilling and capital workovers.\nCash provided by operating activities was $200 million. CRC generated free cash flow 1 of $61 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nOperational Update\nCRC operated an average of nine rigs during the first quarter of 2018 and drilled 74 wells with CRC and JV capital, consisting of 72 development wells (55 steamflood, 10 waterflood, one primary and six unconventional) and two exploration wells. Steamfloods and waterfloods have different production profiles and longer response times than typical conventional wells and, as a result, the full production contribution may not be experienced in the same year that the well is drilled. In the San Joaquin basin, CRC operated seven rigs and produced approximately 87,000 BOE per day for the first quarter. The Los Angeles basin had one rig directed toward waterflood projects, and contributed 24,000 BOE per day of production in the first quarter of 2018. Ventura basin activity included one rig focused on conventional projects and produced approximately 6,000 BOE per day for the first quarter of 2018. The California wildfires in December 2017 and subsequent mudslides negatively impacted Ventura basin production by approximately 400 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2018, in line with expectations incorporated into the Company's previous guidance. The related production effects have been resolved and should not affect second quarter production. CRC continues to focus on oil weighted projects, with no development drilling activity in the Sacramento basin at this time.\nElk Hills Transaction\nAs previously announced, on April 9, 2018 CRC consolidated its interest in the 47,000-acre Elk Hills field by acquiring the remaining working, surface and mineral interests from its long-time partner Chevron. CRC paid cash consideration of $460 million and issued 2.85 million of common shares for the assets. The effective date of the transaction was April 1, 2018. The acquisition includes Chevron's non-operated working interests ranging between 20% and 22% in different producing horizons. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the acquired interests produced an average of 12,700 BOE per day with 46% oil and 9% natural gas liquids. CRC expects to realize the full incremental production in the third quarter of 2018 after the effect of the initial transitional mechanics abate. The Company estimates these additional interests would have added approximately 64 million BOE of proved reserves at year-end 2017 of which approximately 75% are considered proved developed. Over the next two years, CRC estimates up to $20 million of annualized savings as it streamlines production facilities, operations and processes, and leverages Elk Hills' substantial infrastructure.\n2018 Capital Budget\nIn conjunction with improved commodity prices and additional cash flow expected from the acquisition of the Elk Hills interests and synergies, CRC increased its 2018 capital program to a range from $550 million to $600 million, which includes approximately $100 to $150 million in JV capital. This is an increase from its previously stated budget range of $500 million to $550 million. The incremental investment should increase second half 2018 production over first half 2018 levels with a more meaningful effect in 2019. The additional capital will primarily be deployed to drilling, workover and facilities in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins. Further, CRC expects funding of a third tranche of the BSP capital in the second quarter of 2018.\nDebt Reduction Update\nCRC continues to show its commitment to strengthening the balance sheet. In April, CRC repurchased a total of $95 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's second lien notes for $79 million in cash.\nBorrowing Base Redetermination\nEffective May 1, 2018, CRC's borrowing base under its 2014 Credit Agreement was reaffirmed at $2.3 billion.\nHedging Update\nCRC continues to opportunistically seek hedging transactions to protect its cash flow, operating margins and capital program while maintaining adequate liquidity. In the first and second quarters of 2019, CRC hedged approximately 35,000 and 20,000 barrels per day, respectively. The hedges generally form an effective floor at around $63 Brent with a portion of the hedge volumes continuing to provide CRC upside at prices above $67. For the third quarter of 2019, the Company has hedged 10,000 barrels per day providing an effective floor at $65 Brent or Brent plus $15 at prices below $50 Brent. At prices above $65 Brent, CRC continues to receive Brent pricing. See Attachment 8 for more details.\n1 See Attachment 3 for explanations of how CRC calculates and uses the non-GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDAX, adjusted EBITDAX margin, PV-10, free cash flow, production costs (excluding the effects of production sharing-type contracts (PSC)) and adjusted net income (loss), and for reconciliations of the foregoing to their nearest GAAP measure as applicable.\nConference Call Details\nTo participate in today’s conference call scheduled for 5:00 P.M.

Attachment 3 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS Our results of operations can include the effects of unusual, out-of-period and infrequent transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably (in particular certain non-cash items such as derivatives gains and losses) in nature, timing, amount and frequency. Therefore, management uses a measure called adjusted net income (loss) which excludes those items. This measure is not meant to disassociate items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing our performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Adjusted net income (loss) is not considered to be an alternative to net income (loss) reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nWe define adjusted EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; other unusual, out-of-period and infrequent items and other non-cash items. We believe adjusted EBITDAX provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry, the investment community and our lenders. While adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure, the amounts included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. A version of this measure is a material component of certain of our financial covenants under our 2014 revolving credit facility and is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, such as our cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) attributable to common stock to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted net income (loss): First Quarter ($ millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net (loss) income attributable to common stock $ (2 ) $ 53 Unusual, infrequent and other items: Non-cash derivative losses (gains), excluding noncontrolling interest 7 (75 ) Early retirement and severance costs 2 3 Gains on asset divestitures — (21 ) Net gains on early extinguishment of debt — (4 ) Other, net 1 1 Total unusual and infrequent items 10 (96 ) Adjusted net income (loss) $ 8 $ (43 ) Net (loss) income attributable to common stock per share - basic $ (0.05 ) $ 1.23 Net (loss) income attributable to common stock per share - diluted $ (0.05 ) $ 1.22 Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share $ 0.18 $ (1.02 ) DERIVATIVES GAINS AND LOSSES First Quarter ($ millions) 2018 2017 Non-cash derivative (losses) gains, excluding noncontrolling interest $ (7 ) $ 75 Non-cash derivative losses for noncontrolling interest — (1 ) Net payments on settled derivatives (31 ) (1 ) Net derivative (losses) gains $ (38 ) $ 73 FREE CASH FLOW First Quarter ($ millions) 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 200 $ 133 Capital investment (139 ) (50 ) Free cash flow 61 83 Changes in capital accruals 5 17 Capitalized interest (1 ) — Free cash flow, after working capital 65 100 BSP funded capital investment — 15 Free cash flow, after working capital excluding BSP funded capital $ 65 $ 115 ADJUSTED EBITDAX The following tables present a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) attributable to common stock and net cash provided (used) by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDAX.

Attachment 9 2018 SECOND QUARTER GUIDANCE Anticipated Realizations Against the Prevailing Index Prices for Q2 2018 (a) Oil 94% to 98% of Brent NGLs 52% to 56% of Brent Natural Gas 81% to 85% of NYMEX 2018 Second Quarter Production, Capital and Income Statement Guidance Production at current prices (b) 131 to 136 MBOE per day Production at average Q1 2018 Brent of $67 133 to 138 MBOE per day Capital $165 million to $185 million Production costs at current prices (b) $18.10 to $19.60 per BOE Production costs at average Q1 2018 Brent of $67 $17.90 to $19.40 per BOE Adjusted general and administrative expenses (b) & (c) $6.45 to $6.75 per BOE Depreciation, depletion and amortization (b) $10.30 to $10.60 per BOE Taxes other than on income $34 million to $38 million Exploration expense $7 million to $11 million Interest expense (d) $91 million to $95 million Cash Interest (d) $150 million to $154 million Income tax expense rate 0% Cash tax rate 0% Pre-tax 2018 Second Quarter Price Sensitivities (e) $1 change in Brent index - Oil (f) $2.2 million $1 change in Brent index - NGLs $0.8 million $0.50 change in NYMEX - Gas $4.3 million (a) Realizations exclude hedge effects. (b) Based on assumed average Q2 2018 Brent price of $74. (c) Our long-term incentive compensation program for non-executive employees are stock based but payable in cash. Accounting rules require that we adjust the cumulative liability for all vested but yet unpaid awards under these programs to the amount that would be paid using our stock price as of the end of each quarter. Therefore, in addition to the normal pro-rata vesting expense associated with these programs, our quarterly G&A expense includes this cumulative adjustment. Our stock price at March 31, 2018 was $17.15 per share. Our guidance reflects what the effect of such cumulative adjustment will be assuming that our current stock price of approximately $25 per share will prevail at the end of the second quarter. Only about 1/3 of such cumulative adjustment would result in a cash liability in the same year as the adjustment because of the pro-rata three year vesting of our incentive compensation programs. (d) Interest expense includes cash interest, original issue discount and amortization of deferred financing costs as well as the deferred gain that resulted from the December 2015 debt exchange. Cash interest for the quarter is higher than interest expense due to the timing of interest payments. (e) Due to our tax position there is no difference between the impact on our income and cash flows. (f) Amount reflects the sensitivity with respect to unhedged barrels at a Brent index price exceeding $60.00 per barrel and includes the effect of production sharing type contracts at our Wilmington field operations in Long Beach.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006512/en/\nCalifornia Resources Corporation\nScott Espenshade (Investor Relations)\n818-661-6010\nScott.Espenshade@crc.com\nor\nMargita Thompson (Media)\n818-661-6005\nMargita.Thompson@crc.com\nSource: California Resources Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdpregister.com%2F10118433&esheet=51800815&newsitemid=20180503006512&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fdpregister.com%2F10118433&index=2&md5=2f6a60108243bdcfaf0caf83f617a877", "http://dpregister.com/10118433", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crc.com&esheet=51800815&newsitemid=20180503006512&lan=en-US&anchor=www.crc.com&index=3&md5=bfce283447e6edda0a3d0e77f2de0c6b", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crc.com&esheet=51800815&newsitemid=20180503006512&lan=en-US&anchor=www.crc.com&index=4&md5=53edc055047658779beed367352d0a78", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006512/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crc.com&esheet=51800815&newsitemid=20180503006512&lan=en-US&anchor=www.crc.com&index=1&md5=6b09dc1b49f039b2709df791bdc443e5"], "published": "2018-05-04T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T01:31:59.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
