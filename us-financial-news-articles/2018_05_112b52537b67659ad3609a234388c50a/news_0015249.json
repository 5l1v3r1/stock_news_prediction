(NYSE: HTZ) (\"Hertz Global\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for its first quarter 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nConsistent with the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company's U.S. operational improvement initiatives showed progress in nearly all key performance metrics including absolute and unit revenues, unit vehicle depreciation costs, vehicle utilization and time and mileage pricing Total revenue increased 8% Net loss decreased 9% Adjusted Corporate EBITDA improved by $51 million\n\"We entered 2018 a stronger company than one-year ago with positive underlying revenue momentum as our strategies to enhance fleet, customer service and brand value are gaining traction,\" said Kathryn V. Marinello, president and chief executive officer of Hertz. \"At the same time, we have fortified our leadership team and are managing our assets more effectively. The early progress is motivating for our employees and being recognized by our customers. But we still have work to do, reflecting the significant opportunities in front of us, as we position our business for sustainable, long-term growth.\"\nFor the first quarter 2018, total revenues were $2.1 billion, an 8% increase versus the first quarter 2017. Loss before income taxes for the first quarter 2018 was $231 million versus a loss of $294 million in the same period last year. First quarter 2018 net loss was $202 million, or $2.43 loss per diluted share compared with a net loss of $223 million during the first quarter 2017, or $2.69 loss per diluted share. The Company reported adjusted net loss for the first quarter 2018 of $131 million, or $1.58 per adjusted diluted loss per share, compared with adjusted net loss of $134 million, or $1.61 adjusted diluted loss per share, for the same period last year. Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for the first quarter 2018 was a negative $59 million, compared to a negative $110 million in the same period last year.\nU.S. RENTAL CAR (\"U.S. RAC\") SUMMARY\nU.S. RAC (1)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nPercent Inc/(Dec)\n($ in millions, except where noted)\n2018\n2017\nTotal Revenues\n$\n1,426\n$\n1,353\n5\n%\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net\n$\n434\n$\n499\n(13)\n%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$\n(68)\n$\n(132)\n(48)\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss)\n$\n(48)\n$\n(116)\n(59)\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax margin\n(3)\n%\n(9)\n%\n520\nbps\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA\n$\n(48)\n$\n(104)\n(54)\n%\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA margin\n(3)\n%\n(8)\n%\n430\nbps\nAverage vehicles\n478,600\n478,000\n—\n%\nTransaction days (in thousands)\n34,203\n32,312\n6\n%\nTotal RPD (in whole dollars)\n$\n40.93\n$\n41.19\n(1)\n%\nTotal RPU per month (in whole dollars)\n$\n975\n$\n928\n5\n%\nNet depreciation per unit per month (in whole dollars)\n$\n302\n$\n348\n(13)\n%\nTotal U.S. RAC revenues increased 5% versus the prior year quarter as a result of a 6% increase in transaction days and a 1% decline total RPD. Excluding revenue from value-added services and the growth in ride-hailing rentals, time and mileage pricing increased 3%.\nUtilization improved by 430 basis points to 79% on higher transaction day volume and flat vehicle capacity compared with a year ago. Vehicle capacity declined nearly 3%, excluding the growth in fleet specifically dedicated to ride-hailing rentals.\nMonthly net per unit vehicle depreciation expense decreased 13% to $302 as a result of more favorable purchase prices on like-for-like model-year 2018 vehicles, an increased penetration of remarketing vehicles through higher-yielding sales channels, and significantly decreased losses in 2018 versus 2017 that were incurred as part of the prior year quarter's rebalancing of the fleet mix and level.\nDirect vehicle operating and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues for U.S. RAC was 72% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 71% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to incremental investments related to the Company's transformation initiatives.\nRevenue growth coupled with a decrease in monthly depreciation per unit expenses supported an improvement in Adjusted Corporate EBITDA in the first quarter, despite higher expenses associated with the Company's operating turnaround initiatives, which included $10 million of incremental spending for strategic investments year over year, and increased vehicle interest expense due to rising interest rates.\nINTERNATIONAL RENTAL CAR (\"INTERNATIONAL RAC\") SUMMARY\nInternational RAC (1)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nPercent Inc/(Dec)\n($ in millions, except where noted)\n2018\n2017\nTotal Revenues\n$\n468\n$\n411\n14\n%\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net\n$\n102\n$\n85\n20\n%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$\n(12)\n$\n(5)\n140\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss)\n$\n(6)\n$\n(4)\n50\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax margin\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\n(30)\nbps\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA\n$\n—\n$\n3\n(100)\n%\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA margin\n—\n%\n1\n%\n(70)\nbps\nAverage vehicles\n148,700\n150,400\n(1)\n%\nTransaction days (in thousands)\n9,974\n10,184\n(2)\n%\nTotal RPD (in whole dollars)\n$\n45.72\n$\n43.40\n5\n%\nTotal RPU per month (in whole dollars)\n$\n1,022\n$\n980\n4\n%\nNet depreciation per unit per month (in whole dollars)\n$\n222\n$\n204\n9\n%\nThe Company's International RAC segment revenues increased 14%, or 3% excluding a favorable foreign currency impact. Total RPD increased 5%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in transaction days. Excluding the August 2017 sale of the Company's lower-RPD operations in Brazil, Total RPD and transactions days increased 2% and 4%, respectively, due to strength in higher-yielding commercial and multi-month volume. Revenue per unit increased 4% over the prior year.\nMonthly net per unit vehicle depreciation expense increased 9%, or 5% excluding Brazil, primarily as a result of residual-value declines on diesel vehicles in Europe. Vehicle utilization declined by 70 basis points primarily driven by the Company's Spain and Asia Pacific operations. The Company focused on driving higher rate in these regions which impacted overall utilization.\nDirect vehicle operating and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues for International RAC was 77% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 78% for the first quarter of 2017.\nIncreased fleet and operating costs resulted in a $3 million decrease in Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for International RAC compared with a year ago.\nALL OTHER OPERATIONS\nAll Other Operations (1)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nPercent Inc/(Dec)\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nTotal Revenues\n$\n169\n$\n152\n11\n%\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net\n$\n125\n$\n117\n7\n%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$\n19\n$\n18\n6\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss)\n$\n22\n$\n21\n5\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax margin\n13\n%\n14\n%\n(80)\nbps\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA\n$\n20\n$\n20\n—\n%\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA margin\n12\n%\n13\n%\n(130)\nbps\nAverage vehicles - Donlen\n191,600\n207,500\n(8)\n%\nAll Other Operations is primarily comprised of the Company's Donlen leasing operations. A 3% growth in units under lease, as well as a richer mix of vehicles, resulted in increased revenues and depreciation expense. Average vehicles decreased as a result of a reduction in non-lease units in Donlen's maintenance management programs which drive a lower revenue per unit when compared to lease units under these programs.\n(1)\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA margin, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures.

operating company (together, the \"Company\"). The term \"GAAP\" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nDefinitions of non-GAAP measures and key metrics are set forth below. Also set forth below is a summary of the reasons why management of the Company believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the earnings release provide useful information regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations and additional purposes for which management of the Company utilizes the non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nAdjusted Pre-Tax Income (Loss) and Adjusted Pre-tax Margin\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss) is calculated as income (loss) before income taxes plus non-cash acquisition accounting charges, debt-related charges relating to the amortization and write-off of debt financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, goodwill, intangible and tangible asset impairments and write-downs, information technology and finance transformation costs and certain other miscellaneous or non-recurring items. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) is important to management because it allows management to assess operational performance of the Company's business, exclusive of the items mentioned above. It also allows management to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as the segment measure of profitability. Management believes it is important to investors for the same reasons it is important to management and because it allows them to assess the operational performance of the Company on the same basis that management uses internally. When evaluating the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider adjusted pre-tax income (loss) in isolation of, or as a substitute for, measures of the Company's financial performance, such as net income (loss) or income (loss) before income taxes. Adjusted pre-tax margin is adjusted pre-tax income (loss) divided by total revenues.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\nAdjusted net income (loss) is calculated as adjusted pre-tax income (loss) less a provision for income taxes derived utilizing a combined statutory rate. The combined statutory rate is management's estimate of the Company's long-term tax rate. Adjusted net income (loss) is important to management and investors because it represents the Company's operational performance exclusive of the effects of purchase accounting, debt-related charges, and certain other miscellaneous or non-recurring items that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of the Company's competitors.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (\"Adjusted Diluted EPS\")\nAdjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted diluted EPS is important to management and investors because it represents a measure of the Company's operational performance exclusive of the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, debt-related charges, and certain other miscellaneous or non-recurring items that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of the Company's competitors.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, including the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents related to vehicles, net revenue earning vehicle and capital asset expenditures and the net impact of vehicle financing activities. Adjusted free cash flow is important to management and investors as it provides useful information about the amount of cash available for acquisitions and the reduction of non-vehicle debt. When evaluating the Company's liquidity, investors should not consider Adjusted free cash flow in isolation of, or as a substitute for, a measure of the Company's liquidity as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net cash provided by operating activities.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Gross EBITDA\"), Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin\nGross EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation (which includes lease charges on revenue earning vehicles) and amortization. Corporate EBITDA, as presented herein, represents Gross EBITDA as adjusted for vehicle debt interest, vehicle depreciation and vehicle debt-related charges. Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, as presented herein, represents Corporate EBITDA as adjusted for certain other miscellaneous or non-recurring items, as described in more detail in the accompanying schedules.\nManagement uses Gross EBITDA, Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA as operating performance metrics for internal monitoring and planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company's annual operating budget and monthly operating reviews, as well as to facilitate analysis of investment decisions, profitability and performance trends. Further, Gross EBITDA enables management and investors to isolate the effects on profitability of operating metrics such as revenue, direct vehicle and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, which enables management and investors to evaluate the Company's business segments that are financed differently and have different depreciation characteristics and compare the Company's performance against companies with different capital structures and depreciation policies. We also present Adjusted Corporate EBITDA as a supplemental measure because such information is utilized in the determination of certain executive compensation.\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin is calculated as the ratio of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA to total revenues and is used by the Compensation Committee to determine certain executive compensation, primarily in the form of PSUs.\nGross EBITDA, Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. When evaluating the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider Gross EBITDA, Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA in isolation of, or as a substitute for, measures of the Company's financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss) or income (loss) before income taxes.\nFleet Growth\nU.S. and International Rental Car segments fleet growth is defined as revenue earning vehicles expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals, plus vehicle depreciation and net vehicle financing which includes borrowings, repayments and the change in restricted cash associated with vehicles. Fleet growth is important as it allows the Company to assess the cash flow required to support its investment in revenue earning vehicles.\nNet Non-Vehicle Debt\nNet non-vehicle debt is calculated as non-vehicle debt as reported on the Company's balance sheet, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issue costs associated with non-vehicle debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Non-vehicle debt consists of the Company's Senior Term Loan, Senior RCF, Senior Notes, Senior Second Priority Secured Notes, Promissory Notes and certain other non-vehicle indebtedness of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Net non-vehicle debt is important to management and investors as it helps measure the Company's corporate leverage. Net non-vehicle debt also assists in the evaluation of the Company's ability to service its non-vehicle debt without reference to the expense associated with the vehicle debt, which is collateralized by assets not available to lenders under the non-vehicle debt facilities.\nNet Vehicle Debt\nNet vehicle debt is calculated as vehicle debt as reported on the Company's balance sheet, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issue costs associated with vehicle debt, less restricted cash associated with vehicles. Restricted cash associated with vehicle debt is restricted for the purchase of revenue earning vehicles and other specified uses under the Company's vehicle debt facilities and its vehicle rental like-kind exchange program. Net vehicle debt is important to management, investors and ratings agencies as it helps measure the Company's leverage with respect to its vehicle assets.\nTotal Net Debt\nTotal net debt is calculated as total debt, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issue costs, less total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash associated with vehicle debt. Unamortized debt issue costs are required to be reported as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt obligation under GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects that these costs have on debt will more accurately reflect the Company's net debt position. Total net debt is important to management, investors and ratings agencies as it helps measure the Company's gross leverage.\nKEY METRICS\nAvailable Car Days\nAvailable car days is calculated as average vehicles multiplied by the number of days in a period.\nAverage Vehicles\nAverage Vehicles, also known as \"fleet capacity\", is determined using a simple average of the number of vehicles in the fleet whether owned or leased by the Company at the beginning and end of a given period. Among other things, average vehicles is used to calculate Vehicle Utilization which represents the portion of the Company's vehicles that are being utilized to generate revenue.\nNet Depreciation Per Unit Per Month\nNet depreciation per unit per month represents the amount of average depreciation expense and lease charges, net per vehicle per month and is calculated as depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net, with all periods adjusted to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, divided by the average vehicles in each period and then dividing by the number of months in the period reported. Management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it is reflective of how the Company is managing the costs of its vehicles and facilitates in comparison with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.\nTime and Mileage Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"T&M rate\" or \"T&M pricing\")\nTime and mileage pricing is calculated as total rental revenue less revenue from value-added services, such as charges to the customer for the fueling of vehicles, loss damage waivers, insurance products, supplemental equipment and other consumables, divided by the total number of transaction days. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents a measurement of the changes in base rental fees, which comprise the majority of the Company's Total RPD.\nTotal Rental Revenue\nTotal rental revenue is calculated as total revenue less ancillary retail vehicle sales revenue, with all periods adjusted to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends.\nTotal Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"Total RPD,\" also referred to as \"pricing\")\nTotal RPD is calculated as total rental revenue divided by the total number of transaction days. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents a measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control.\nTotal Revenue Per Unit Per Month (\"Total RPU\")\nTotal RPU is calculated as total rental revenue divided by the average vehicles in each period and then dividing by the number of months in the period reported. This metric is important to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to fleet capacity, or asset efficiency.\nTransaction Days (also referred to as \"volume\")\nTransaction days, also known as volume, represent the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted as one transaction day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one transaction day in a 24-hour period. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue generating days.\nVehicle Utilization\nVehicle utilization is calculated by dividing total transaction days by available car days. This metric is important to management and investors as it is the measurement of the proportion of vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to fleet capacity.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hertz-global-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300643888.html\nSOURCE Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://ir.hertz.com/", "http://www.hertz.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hertz-global-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300643888.html"], "published": "2018-05-08T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T23:29:59.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
