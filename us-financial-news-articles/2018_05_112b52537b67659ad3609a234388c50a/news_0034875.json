The same day, FTSE Russell issued a statement announcing that Longfin would be removed from its global indices after market close on March 28, 2018, approximately 12 days after being added. Then, on March 27, 2018, CNBC published an article entitled “Longfin loses more than a third of its value after the controversial cryptocurrency stock is booted from the Russell 2000 index.” In the article, Meenavalli stated that Longfin would be taking legal action against Citron for its negative comments. Following each of these announcements, the Company’s stock dropped significantly.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation, commercial transaction, and public advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180516005345/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51807284&newsitemid=20180516005345&lan=en-US&anchor=Willie+Briscoe&index=1&md5=cf5b7bf3719783aa19e88e758de6cb8f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51807284&newsitemid=20180516005345&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Briscoe+Law+Firm%2C+PLLC&index=3&md5=b788cbb1dde1bb894f79be24c1ad2554", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51807284&newsitemid=20180516005345&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Briscoe+Law+Firm%2C+PLLC&index=2&md5=dbafedc8d3df2959f015ace00446bbdf", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180516005345/en/"], "published": "2018-05-16T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:26:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
