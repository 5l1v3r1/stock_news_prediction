More than 2,200 Palestinians were also injured by gunfire or tear gas, Palestinian medics said.\nshow chapters More than 50 dead in Gaza as US opens embassy in Jerusalem 3:03 PM ET Mon, 14 May 2018 | 01:50 Palestinian leaders have called Monday's events a massacre, and the Israeli tactic of using live fire against the protesters has drawn worldwide concern and condemnation.\nThe United Nations Security Council was due to meet to discuss the situation.\nIsrael has said it is acting in self-defense to defend its borders and communities. Its main ally the United States has backed that stance, with both saying that Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the coastal enclave, instigated the violence.\nOn Tuesday morning, mourners marched through Gaza, waving Palestinian flags and calling for revenge.\n\"With souls and blood we redeem you martyrs,\" they shouted.\nThere were fears of further bloodshed as a six-week protest campaign was due to reach its climax.\nMay 15 is traditionally the day Palestinians mark the \"Nakba\", or Catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes in violence culminating in war between the newly created Jewish state and its Arab neighbors in 1948.\nThe protests, dubbed \"The Great March of Return,\" began on March 30 and revived calls for refugees to have the right of return to their former lands, which now lie inside Israel.\nIsrael rejects any right of return, fearing that it would deprive the state of its Jewish majority.\nPalestinian medical officials say 105 Gazans have now been killed since the start of the protests and nearly 11,000 people wounded, about 3,500 of them hit by live fire. Israeli officials dispute those numbers. No Israeli casualties have been reported.\nMore than 2 million people are crammed into the narrow Gaza Strip, more than two thirds of them refugees. Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt maintain tight restrictions on the enclave, deepening economic hardship and raising humanitarian concerns.\nSharpshooters On the Israeli side of the border, Israeli sharpshooters took up positions to stop any attempted breach of the fence should demonstrations break out again. Tanks were also deployed.\nA senior Israeli commander said that of the 60 Gazans killed on Monday, 14 were carrying out attacks and 14 others were militants.\nHe also said Palestinians protesters were using hundreds of pipe bombs, grenades and fire-bombs. Militants had opened fire on Israeli troops and tried to set off bombs by the fence.\nMany casualties were caused by Palestinians carrying out devices that went off prematurely,\" he said.\n\"We approve every round fired before it is fired. Every target is spotted in advance. We know where the bullet lands and where it is aimed,\" said the commander, who spoke on condition that he not be named, in accordance with Israeli regulations.\n\"However reality on the ground is such that unintended damage is caused,\" he said.\nIn Geneva, the U.N. human rights office condemned what it called the \"appalling deadly violence\" by Israeli forces.\nU.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said Israel had a right to defend its borders according to international law, but lethal force must only be used a last resort, and was not justified by Palestinians approaching the Gaza fence.\nThe U.N. rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Michael Lynk, said Israel's use of force may amount to a war crime.\nYoung victim In Gaza City, hundreds marched in the funeral of eight-month-old Leila al-Ghandour, whose body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag.\n\"Let her stay with me, It is too early for her to go,\" her mother cried, pressing the baby's body to her chest.\nSpeaking earlier, her grandmother said the child was at one of the tented protest camps and had inhaled tear gas.\n\"When we got back home, the baby stopped crying and I thought she was asleep. I took her to the children's hospital and the doctor told me she was martyred (dead),\" Heyam Omar said.\nMany shops in East Jerusalem were shut throughout the day following a call by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for a general strike across the Palestinian Territories. A 70-second siren was sounded in the occupied West Bank in commemoration of the Nakba.\nHoly city Most Gaza protesters stay around tent camps but groups have ventured closer to the border fence, rolling burning tyres and throwing stones. Some have flown kites carrying containers of petrol that spread fires on the Israeli side.\nMonday's protests were fueled by the opening ceremony for the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem following its relocation from Tel Aviv . The move fulfilled a pledge by U.S. President Donald Trump , who in December recognized the contested city as the Israeli capital.\nPalestinians envision East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they hope to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel regards all of Jerusalem, including the eastern sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed, as its \"eternal and indivisible capital\".\nMost countries say the status of Jerusalem - a sacred city to Jews, Muslims and Christians - should be determined in a final peace settlement and that moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal.\nNetanyahu praised Trump's decisions but Palestinians have said the United States can no longer serve as an honest broker in any peace process. Talks aimed a finding a two-state solution to the conflict have been frozen since 2014.\nTrump said on Monday he remained committed to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. His administration says it has nearly completed a new Israeli-Palestinian peace plan but is undecided on how and when to roll it out.\nNetanyahu blamed Hamas for the Gaza violence. Hamas denied instigating it but the White House backed Netanyahu, saying Hamas \"intentionally and cynically provoking this response.\"\nThe United States on Monday blocked a Kuwait-drafted U.N. Security Council statement that would have expressed \"outrage and sorrow at the killing of Palestinian civilians\" and called for an independent investigation, U.N. diplomats said.\nIn the British parliament, junior foreign office minister Alistair Burt said the United States needed to show more understanding about the causes of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nHamas' role in the violence must be investigated, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T17:45:02.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
