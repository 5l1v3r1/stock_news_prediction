CERRITOS, CA, First Choice Bancorp, “First Choice” or the “Company” (NASDAQ: FCBP), the holding company of First Choice Bank (the “Bank”), a wholly-owned banking subsidiary, today announced earnings for the first quarter of 2018, and declares a second quarterly 2018 cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, payable on May 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 18, 2018.\nThe dividend is the second this year of the Company’s quarterly cash dividend program that the Bank commenced in January 2017, which is the result of the Company’s strong ongoing financial performance and significant capital strength. This quarter’s cash dividend follows a previous $0.20 per share cash dividend the Company paid on February 20, 2018; and previous quarterly cash dividends paid by the Bank on November 20, 2017, August 31, 2017; May 31, 2017; February 24, 2017; a previous special $0.11 and $0.20 per share annual cash dividends paid by the Bank in 2013 and 2014, respectively; and 4% stock dividends the Bank paid in 2015 and 2016.\nEarnings for the First Quarter of 2018\nEarnings continue to be strong year-over-year at $2.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 11.9% compared to $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, and an increase of 149.2% compared to $0.96 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 net income included $1.8 million of additional income tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, impacting quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Excluding this additional tax expense, net income for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 14.9% compared to the adjusted fourth quarter of 2017 net income of $2.8 million.\n“We are very pleased to be able to report strong year-over-year growth in income,” stated Peter Hui, the founding chairman of the Board of the Company, “and we are very pleased to be able to continue to return a portion of our net income to our shareholders in the form of our quarterly dividend.”\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $947.7 million, up $43.9 million or 4.9% from December 31, 2017. Year-over-year, total assets increased $32.9 million or 3.6%, compared to the balance at March 31, 2017.\nTotal gross loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $47.9 million, or 6.4%, during the first quarter of 2018 to $790.7 million, compared with $742.8 million at December 31, 2017. During the first three months of 2018, the Company originated in total over $97.2 million in new loan commitments. New loan commitments originated during the first quarter of 2018 occurred in the commercial and industrial (“C&I”) segment of the portfolio, at $31.2 million and commercial real estate (“CRE”) commitments, including construction, owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied CRE originated totaled $62.6 million. New originations were partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in the construction and residential mortgage loan portfolios, as a result of loan payoffs.\nAsset quality measures remained strong at March 31, 2018. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $10.0 million, and the allowance for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments was $1.0 million at March 31, 2018. The $10.0 million allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2018, decreased $0.5 million, or 4.6% from $10.5 million at December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from three loans which were charged off during the first quarter of 2018.\nThe allowance for loan losses represented 1.27% of quarter-end gross loans, and 943.5% of non-performing assets as of March 31, 2018. The comparable ratios were 1.41% of year-end gross loans, and 572.3% of non-performing assets as of December 31, 2017.\nNon-performing assets fell to $1.1 million or 0.1% of total assets as of March 31, 2018, compared to $1.8 million or 0.2% of total assets as of December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $0.8 million, or 42% from prior quarter. The decrease in nonperforming assets was due in part to the net charge-off of $0.7 million in non-accruing loans in the first quarter. Loans 30-89 days past due were $0.6 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company recorded $0.2 million of provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a negative provision of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The provision expense recorded during the first quarter of 2018 primarily took into account the three loans which were charged off in the quarter, combined with the Bank’s loan growth.\nThe loan portfolio included five non-accrual loans in the amount of $1.1 million; among the five non-accrual loans, four loans are current under their existing modified terms. All of the non-accrual loans were classified as Troubled Debt Restructured (“TDR”). There was no Other Real Estate Owned.\nSBA loan production was flat in the first quarter of 2018. The total SBA loan portfolio, net of retained discount was $89.0 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $89.4 million as of December 31, 2017. New loan commitments during the first quarter of 2018 were $3.8 million. Gain-on-sale of loans amounted to $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, primarily related to the sale of the guaranteed portions of SBA 7a loans.\nThe Company’s total investment portfolio at March 31, 2018 stood at $38.8 million, including $5.3 million in the Company’s held-to-maturity portfolio that was pledged as collateral for the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. In addition, cash and due from banks was $100.1 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to $103.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, total deposits were $758.8 million, of which $197.5 million, 26.0% of total deposits, was in non-interest bearing checking accounts. Total deposits were down $13.9 million, or 1.8% from the previous quarter. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased by $38.1 million, or 16.2 %, primarily due to deposits from real estate 1031 exchanges, which were lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. Saving accounts decreased by $16.1 million or 21.2%. On the contrary, money market accounts and certificates of deposit increased 23.0% and 26.6% respectively from the previous quarter.\nThe Company’s gross loan-to-deposit ratio was 104.2% at March 31, 2018 as compared to 96.1% as of December 31, 2017. Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco advances and other fed fund borrowings were at $57.0 million and $18.0 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2018 as compared $20 million and $0, respectively as of December 31, 2017.\nThe senior secured debt increased to $2.6 million as of March 31, 2018, as compared to $0.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase primarily related to additional borrowings by the Company for cash dividend payout in February and merger related expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2018.\nRobert M. Franko, President and CEO of the Bank further commented, “We are pleased to have started trading today on NASDAQ. This was a major achievement for our company, and it involved the efforts of many of our colleagues in the Bank. We still have a lot of work to do this year, especially as we progress toward the closing of the acquisition of Pacific Commerce Bancorp and Pacific Commerce Bank.”\nTotal common equity capital at the quarter-end was $106.5 million, a quarter-over-quarter increase of 0.7% compared to December 31, 2017. The Bank’s book value (BV) and tangible book value (TBV) per common share of stock were $14.68 and $14.68, respectively, at quarter-end, following the Bank’s quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 paid in February 2018. This compared with $14.56 (BV) and $14.56 (TBV) at December 31, 2017. The increase in common book value per share at March 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to a strong net income of $2.4 million, which was partially offset by $1.5 million in cash dividends.\nThe Bank’s capital ratios remained strong at the end of the first quarter of 2018, with Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based ratios at 13.0% and 14.3%, respectively, comparing favorably to the well-capitalized requirements of 8% and 10%, respectively.\nNet interest income and net interest margin for the current quarter were $9.6 million and 4.38%, respectively. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, net interest income decreased $0.3 million, but net interest margin increased by 3 basis points, primarily due to two fewer days in the first quarter of 2018 and certain early payoffs in the CRE loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted in the accelerated recognition of interest income from the unamortized loan discounts. The average loan portfolio balance was $774.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 0.3% increase from $772.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The cost of deposits was 0.79% for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 3 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of 0.02% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2017, net interest income and net interest margin increased by $1.9 million, and 77 basis points respectively. The increase was primarily due to organic growth in average earning assets, and some increases in yield as a result of the Fed rate increases over the year. The average loan portfolio balance was $774.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a 10.4% increase from $701.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The average yield of loans was 5.6% at March 31, 2018, compared to 4.9% at March 31, 2017. The cost of deposits at 0.79% for the first quarter of 2018 only increased 2 basis points compared to 0.77% at March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.6 million, a $0.4 million decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017. Gains on sales of SBA loans were $0.2 million for the current quarter, down $0.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 as the volume of SBA loans sold decreased to $2.7 million from $4.0 million for the preceding quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, non-interest income decreased by $0.9 million. Gains on sales of SBA loans were down $0.9 million from the first quarter of 2017 as the volume of SBA loans sold decreased to $2.7 million from $13.3 million for the same period of last year.\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.7 million, compared to $6.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in non-interest expense during the first quarter of 2018 was acquisition and professional expenses related to our Nasdaq listing and our pending acquisition of Pacific Commerce Bancorp, as well as the seasonal increase in payroll tax expense that generally occurs in the first calendar quarter of the year. Total merger expense incurred in the first quarter of 2018 was $264 thousand. These increases were offset by the decreases in the off balance sheet provision for unfunded loan commitments and the customer service costs recorded in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The efficiency ratio was 66.0% in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 60.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in operating income. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, non-interest expense increased to $6.7 million from $5.5 million. The $1.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, coupled with increases in costs related to legal and professional expenses related to the Nasdaq listing and certain acquisition costs. As a result of the increase in non-interest expense, the efficiency ratio increased to 66.0% for the first quarter of 2018 from 60.5% for the same period of last year.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, income tax expense was $0.9 million and the effective tax rate was 26.5%, which was lower than the statutory effective tax rate due to the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation. Tax expense decreased by $2.8 million and $0.6 million from the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2017, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to a decline in the federal effective tax rate to 21% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, in addition to the effect of accounting for the stock-based compensation. For the full year of 2018, First Choice is expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 29%.\nSelected Financial Highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\n● Pre-tax income of $3.2 million ● Net Income of $2.4 million ● Return on average assets annualized at 1.1% ● Return on average tangible common equity annualized at 8.8% ● Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses at 1.27% of total gross loans, and 943.5% of all non-performing assets ● Earnings per Share for the quarter at $0.33 (basic) and $0.33 (diluted) ● Annualized earnings per share at $1.33 (basic) and $1.32 (diluted) ● Earnings per Share Trailing 12 Months at $1.06 (basic) and $1.05 (diluted) ● Book Value and Tangible Book Value per Share at $14.68 (BV) and $14.68 (TBV), respectively ● Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, CET1, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital and total Risk-Based Ratios at 12.2%, 13.0%, 13.0% and 14.3%, respectively, comparing very favorably to the well-capitalized requirements of 5.0%, 6.5%, 8% and 10%, respectively, which are the respective minimum required ratios for a bank to be deemed “Well-Capitalized” by the FDIC ● The Bank’s Basel III Capital conservation buffer was 6.27%, well above the dividend payout restriction of 1.88% and 2.5% requirements in the 2018 transition period and the 2019 fully effective limit ABOUT FIRST CHOICE BANCORP\nFirst Choice Bancorp is the registered bank holding company respectively, which are the respective minimum required ratios for a bank to be deemed “Well-Capitalized” by the FDICrespectively, which are the respective minimum required ratios for a bank to be deemed “Well-Capitalized” by the FDICfor First Choice Bank.
