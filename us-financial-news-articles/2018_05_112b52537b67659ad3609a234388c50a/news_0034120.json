It reported a drop in first-quarter net profit due to ongoing problems in the oil sector, leading to impairments on loans to shipping and offshore services clients.\n“Loan losses were more than three times consensus forecast at 30 basis points in the quarter... The large increase in loan losses is likely to raise questions about the asset quality outlook,” UBS analysts said.\nHealthcare stocks were the best-performing, following a rally in U.S. pharma on Friday after investors found U.S. President Trump’s speech on drug prices less harmful than expected for pharma companies’ business models.\n“We see limited impact from Trump’s blueprint on drug pricing,” said Credit Suisse analysts. “While investors will feel a sense of relief coming out of Friday, we believe the broader overhang around drug pricing reform will persist as we approach the 2018 U.S. midterm elections.”\nThe healthcare sector index climbed 1 percent.\nEasing U.S.-China trade tensions failed to boost European markets, and Trump’s U-turn on Chinese phone company ZTE, the world’s 4th largest telecom equipment vendor, actually sent Nokia shares down 1 percent, while Ericsson fell 1.1 percent.\nInvestors had hoped the Nordic telecom equipment companies would see stronger sales and margins after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American supplies to ZTE and the firm suspended operations.\nWith three-quarters of the MSCI Europe index having reported earnings, energy stocks were leading the market by far, with year-on-year earnings growth of 10.5 percent while the overall market’s earnings growth was flat in euro terms.\nThe STOXX 600 oil & gas index rose 0.5 percent, reversing earlier as OPEC reported that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, lifting crude prices.
