First quarter 2017 GAAP net earnings were $173.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.52.\nAdjusted Net Earnings for first quarter 2018 were $193.9 million, compared to $197.8 million of Adjusted Net Earnings in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) were $0.58 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.59 of Adjusted Diluted EPS in the year-ago quarter. Analysts’ consensus estimate for first quarter 2018 Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.58.\nAdjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are not recognized terms under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be substituted for GAAP net earnings or GAAP diluted earnings per share, respectively, as measures of Cerner’s performance, but instead should be utilized as supplemental measures of financial performance in evaluating our business. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results,” where our non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nOther Highlights:\nFirst quarter operating cash flow of $409.0 million. First quarter Free Cash Flow of $255.7 million. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP cash flows from operating activities less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results.” First quarter days sales outstanding of 73 days, up from 71 days in the year-ago period. Total backlog of $14.63 billion. Backlog reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance effective for this quarter, which will be further discussed in Cerner’s Form 10-Q. Certain provisions within such guidance impact how we calculate backlog. Backlog amounts disclosed in prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, and are not comparable to, the current period presentation.\n“Our results in the first quarter included strong bookings and cash flow and in-line earnings, but our revenue was below expected levels,” said Zane Burke, President. “Our mixed results and revised outlook reflect the delay of a large contract and a less predictable end market. However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities due to our strong market position and portfolio of solutions and tech-enabled services that align with the pressures health care stakeholders are facing.”\nFuture Period Guidance\nCerner currently expects:\nSecond quarter 2018 revenue between $1.310 billion and $1.360 billion. Full year 2018 revenue between $5.325 billion and $5.450 billion, down from a range of $5.450 billion to $5.650 billion. Second quarter 2018 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share between $0.59 and $0.61. Full year 2018 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share between $2.45 and $2.55, down from a range of $2.57 to $2.73. Second quarter 2018 new business bookings between $1.350 billion and $1.550 billion.\nEarnings Conference Call\nCerner will host an earnings conference call to provide additional detail on the Company’s results and outlook at 3:30 p.m. CT on May 2, 2018. On the call, Cerner will discuss its first quarter 2018 results and answer questions from the investment community.

However, we supplement our GAAP results with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review and understanding of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to GAAP results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with Cerner's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculations. We provide the measures of Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as such measures are used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze Cerner's business, make strategic decisions, assess long-term trends on a comparable basis, and for management compensation purposes. We provide the measure of Free Cash Flow as such measure takes into account certain capital expenditures necessary to operate our business. Free Cash Flow is used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business. We calculate each of our non-GAAP financial measures as follows: Adjusted Operating Earnings - Consists of GAAP operating earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, and (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments. Adjusted Net Earnings - Consists of GAAP net earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments, (v) the income tax effect of the aforementioned items, and (vi) share-based compensation permanent tax items. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share - Consists of Adjusted Net Earnings, as defined above, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, in the applicable period. Free Cash Flow - Consists of cash flows from operating activities, less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. Adjustments included in the calculations of Adjusted Operating Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings are described below: Share-based compensation expense - Non-cash expense arising from our equity compensation and stock purchase plans available to our associates and directors. We exclude share-based compensation expense as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Share-based compensation expense is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows: (In thousands) Three Months Ended 2018 2017 Sales and client service $ 12,579 $ 9,671 Software development 5,425 4,227 General and administrative 8,453 4,957 Total share-based compensation expense $ 26,457 $ 18,855 Health Services acquisition-related amortization - Non-cash expense consisting of the amortization of customer relationships, acquired technology, and trade name intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude Health Services acquisition-related amortization as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\" Acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment - Consists of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. Accounting guidance requires that deferred revenue acquired in a business combination be written-down to an estimate of fulfillment cost, plus a normal profit margin, as a part of the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We add back the amount of the write-down applicable to the period as we believe such amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of our business operations. Other acquisition-related adjustments - Consists of acquisition, employee separation, and other costs associated with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude other acquisition-related adjustments as they are non-recurring charges, and we believe the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"General and administrative\" expense. Income tax effect of pre-tax adjustments - The GAAP effective income tax rate for the applicable quarterly period is applied to pre-tax adjustments for Adjusted Net Earnings. Share-based compensation permanent tax items - Consists of permanent items impacting the Company's income tax provision related to our share-based compensation arrangements, including net excess tax benefits recognized upon the exercise of stock options. We exclude such items as we believe the amount of such items in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"Income taxes.\" Cerner's future period guidance in this release includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, which may include without limitation share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, such as integration expenses, and may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments relating to the Company's acquired businesses, and may also be affected by nonrecurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, all of which are excluded in the calculation of non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as described above. The exact amount of these adjustments are not currently determinable, but may be significant. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nCERNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS As of March 31,
