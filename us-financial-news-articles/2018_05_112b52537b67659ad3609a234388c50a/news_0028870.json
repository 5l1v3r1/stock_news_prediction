That was above an average estimate of 235.4 billion yen from 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFor the current financial year, Takeda sees an operating profit of 201 billion yen.\nThe earnings come days after it agreed to acquire London-listed Shire for $62 billion in a deal that will propel it into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers.
