Westpac is the only one of the top four lenders that chose to fight its case in court instead of settling with the regulator.\n“In summary, I have rejected ASIC’s case,” Justice David Beach said in delivering the judgment in Melbourne. However, the judge also said Australia’s second-largest bank had engaged in unconscionable conduct.\nThe decision comes during an embarrassing public inquiry into the country’s highly-concentrated banking sector that has seen billions of dollars wiped from lenders’ collective market values and exposed them to massive fines.\nBesides Westpac, the nation’s top banks are Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Australia Bank Ltd.\nASIC had argued that communications within the bank and with external traders that included expletive-ridden exchanges between traders captured in email records and telephone recordings showed them boasting about how much money they had made from BBSW fixes.\n“But many of these communications are open to competing interpretations, particularly when understood in context ... where there has been uncertainty as to what was said or what was meant or conveyed after considering the context and all relevant circumstances, I have resolved that uncertainty in Westpac’s favour,” the judge added.\n“I have also concluded that by reason of inadequate procedures and training, Westpac contravened its financial services licensee obligations,” the judge said\nWestpac shares were almost unchanged after the verdict, down 0.5 percent by midday on Thursday.
