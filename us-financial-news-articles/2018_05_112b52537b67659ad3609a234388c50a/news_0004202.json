The pro ration factor under the Offer is preliminary and subject to verification. The Trust and the Depositary expect that the final determination of the pro ration factor will be made on or before May 7, 2018.\nThe Trust will make payment for the REIT A Units tendered and accepted for purchase by tendering the aggregate purchase price to the Depositary on or before May 8, 2018 in accordance with the Offer and applicable laws and the Depositary will effect payment to unitholders promptly thereafter. Payment for REIT A Units will be made in cash, without interest. Any REIT A Units invalidly tendered or tendered and not purchased will be returned to the tendering unitholder promptly by the Depositary.\nThe full terms and conditions of the Offer are described in detail in the offer to purchase and issuer bid circular of the Trust dated March 23, 2018, as well as the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery, which are available under the Trust’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com .\nAbout Dream Office REIT\nDream Office REIT is an unincorporated, open-ended real estate investment trust.
