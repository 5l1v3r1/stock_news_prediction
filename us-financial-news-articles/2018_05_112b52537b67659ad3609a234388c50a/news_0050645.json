There is only one other Kuwaiti investor in Basra, involved in a shopping mall, Ghasseb said.\nBut trade has picked up in recent years as foreign firms use Kuwait’s port to ship goods to Iraq due to its better security. Up to 200 vehicles cross the border at the Safwan post every day, an Iraqi officer said.\nKuwaiti visitors are also trickling back to the Shi’ite Muslim holy cities of Najaf and Kerbela. A third of Kuwaitis are Shi’ites.\nIn the other direction there is little private traffic as Kuwait rarely grants visitor visas for Iraqis for security reasons.\n“I come twice a year. There are no problems for Kuwaitis now,” said a Kuwaiti who gave his name as Mohamed after crossing the border to make a pilgrimage to Nawaf.\nReporting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T16:10:11.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
