(The company) has the capability to finance and implement its downstream processing strategy at Wodgina on its own,” Ellison added.\nThe stake sale comes amid burgeoning sector consolidation, with Australian lithium miner Galaxy Resources ( GXY.AX ) assessing options for its stake in a large lithium deposit in Argentina.\nMineral Resources said lithium processors, battery manufacturers, international trading companies and automakers had approached it over Wodgina.\n“Min Res are used to putting together a joint venture on a project,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Larry Hill, adding that contenders would be companies that could process the mineral into a battery-ready form.\nMineral Resources may also consider selling its offtake from the project to partners as part of the transaction. Appetite for Australian hard rock deposits is increasing as manufacturers look to secure high-purity supply.\nWodgina is among the world’s biggest hard rock deposits and is also located close to Port Hedland, a large bulk commodities port.\nInvestment bank Macquarie Capital (Australia) and Australian law firm Gilbert and Tobin have been appointed to assist with the sale. Mineral Resources said it was planning to announce a buyer in the second half of the year.\nShares in the firm were up about 0.6 percent, compared to a 0.5-percent rise in the broader market .\nReporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne; Additional reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T09:50:59.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
