This endeavor provides a national platform and expands KMF's twelve-year mission. Clery Center will be carrying on KMF's legacy through their shared mission for safer campuses.\nClery Center adds Kristin's Krusade ® to its National Campus Safety Awareness Month, \"We Don't Haze\" Project, Campus Fire Safety Awareness, Campus Roll Call Video Series, and OVW Campus Grant Program initiatives. In addition to continuing to educate on dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, Kristin's Krusade ® will also endow a fellowship for a student or professional in a related field to further their education and training with Clery Center.\nBill Mitchell, former president of KMF, joined the Clery Center board of directors on April 26, 2018. Like the Clery family, the Mitchells lost their daughter too soon when she was murdered by her ex-boyfriend only three weeks after she graduated from Saint Joseph's University. KMF was founded to both honor Kristin's memory and raise awareness about dating violence.\nAlison Kiss, executive director of Clery Center, said, \"The boards at Clery Center and KMF understand there is power in numbers. This partnership will result in education and awareness programs for colleges, students, and parents specifically around dating violence. This was an optimal time for this transition with the recent addition of dating violence to the Clery Act in 2013.\" Bill Mitchell added, \"Becoming an initiative within Clery Center will make the dating violence issue more national in scope. Our good work at KMF will thrive within Clery for what I expect to be a very long time.\"\nFor more information on Kristin's Krusade ® , please visit Clery Center's Initiatives page, or read our latest blog post by Bill Mitchell.\nAbout Clery Center\nClery Center is a national nonprofit organization that helps institutions of higher education understand and comply with the Clery Act via strategic consulting services, policy insight, and staff compliance training.
