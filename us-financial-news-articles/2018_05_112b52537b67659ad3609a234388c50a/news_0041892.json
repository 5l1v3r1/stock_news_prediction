Rising oil prices could also lead to a boost in capex, he said.\nStill, the Petrobras CEO said any investment boost would be at the margins, without any “structural change in investment levels.”\nParente also said the company expects to announce a new debt reduction target for 2019 by the beginning of August, while a revised business plan will be released by the end of the year.
