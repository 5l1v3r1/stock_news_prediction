See \"March 31, 2018 Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for definitions, discussions of their uses and inherent limitations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.hcpi.com/financial-reconciliation .\nSAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO OPERATING SUMMARY\nThe tables below outline the year-over-year three-month SPP Cash NOI growth and the components of our senior housing operating portfolio (\"SHOP\") SPP Cash NOI growth for the first quarter:\nThree-Month SPP Cash NOI Growth\nSenior housing triple-net\n0.5%\nSHOP\n(6.4%)\nLife science\n0.4%\nMedical office\n1.6%\nOther non-reportable segments (\"Other\")\n1.2%\nTotal Portfolio\n(0.2%)\nComponents of SHOP SPP Cash NOI Growth\nCore\nPortfolio (1)\nTransition/Sale\nPortfolio (2)\nTotal\nProperty count\n35\n34\n69\nSPP Cash NOI Growth\n(0.6%)\n(12.3%)\n(6.4%)\n(1)\nIncludes 18 properties managed by Brookdale and 17 properties managed by five operators that are not expected to undergo a transition or sale during 2018.\n(2)\nRepresents properties managed by Brookdale that have transitioned or are expected to transition to new operators or sell in 2018.\nTRANSACTION UPDATES\nU.K. PORTFOLIO TRANSACTION\nIn May, we entered into definitive agreements with an institutional investor to create a joint venture through which we will sell a 51% interest in our U.K. holdings based on a total portfolio value of £394 million. We expect to receive approximately £315 million of proceeds inclusive of the sale of our 51% interest and third party property-level debt. As part of the agreement, we have the ability to sell our remaining 49% interest in the joint venture to the institutional investor by no later than 2020.\nACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS WITH BROOKDALE\nIn November 2017, we announced a series of acquisitions and dispositions between HCP and Brookdale. To date, we have closed the following transactions:\nWe sold the first of six assets to Brookdale for $32 million in January 2018 and the remaining five assets for $243 million in April 2018. We acquired Brookdale's 10% interest in the RIDEA III joint venture for $32 million in December 2017 and Brookdale's 10% interest in the RIDEA I joint venture for $63 million in March 2018.\nOPERATOR TRANSITIONS\nIn March, we announced an agreement to transition management of a portfolio of 24 HCP-owned senior housing communities from Brookdale to Atria. We have completed transitions on 13 communities and expect the remainder of the properties to transition during the second quarter, subject to obtaining the required regulatory approvals. Additionally, we transitioned one community to another existing operator, Sonata Senior Living (\"Sonata\").\nIn addition to Atria and Sonata, we are finalizing agreements with other operators to transition additional Brookdale managed communities and anticipate completing these transitions during 2018.\nTANDEM DEBT INVESTMENT\nAs previously announced, in March, we sold our Tandem Mezzanine Loan investment for $112 million resulting in an impairment recovery of $3 million. This disposition ends our exposure to both stand-alone post-acute/skilled-nursing assets and highly-leveraged mezzanine investments.\nDEVELOPMENT UPDATES\nHAYDEN LEASING AND DEVELOPMENT\nSince acquiring the Hayden Research Campus (\"Hayden\") in December 2017, leasing velocity has been strong with the two-building life science campus now 97% leased, up from 66% at the time of acquisition. The new tenants are a combination of venture-backed early-stage and publicly-traded mid-stage biotechnology companies, both of which are expanding from their current locations in the Cambridge and suburban Boston submarkets.\nGiven strong market fundamentals, in March we acquired development rights at Hayden for $21 million. The planned 214,000 square foot Class A development will enhance our scale in a leading life science market.\nRIDGEVIEW\nIn April, we signed two leases totaling 150,000 square feet with General Atomics, a major defense contractor headquartered in San Diego, at our Ridgeview development located in the San Diego suburb of Poway, California. The $62 million, 300,000 square foot development is now 100% leased to General Atomics.\nBALANCE SHEET\nAt March 31, 2018, we had $1.0 billion of liquidity from a combination of cash and availability under our $2.0 billion credit facility. Additionally, we have no major senior notes or secured debt maturities until 2019.\nOn April 6, 2018, we repaid $290 million on our credit facility, primarily using proceeds from asset sales to Brookdale.\nEXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nScott Brinker joined HCP as Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, effective March 1, 2018.\nAs previously announced, HCP appointed Lydia Kennard and Kent Griffin as new independent directors and named Brian Cartwright Chairman of the Board. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.hcpi.com .\nDIVIDEND\nOn April 26, 2018, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 22, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 7, 2018.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nIn April, we published our 7th annual Corporate Sustainability Report highlighting the environmental, social, and governance aspects of our operations. More information about HCP's sustainability efforts, including a link to our Sustainability Report, can be found on our website at www.hcpi.com/sustainable-growth .\n2018 GUIDANCE\nFor full year 2018, we are reaffirming the following guidance ranges:\nNet income per share of $0.79 to $0.85 FFO per share of $1.73 to $1.79 FFO as adjusted per share of $1.77 to $1.83 SPP Cash NOI to increase 0.25% to 1.75%\nThese estimates do not reflect the potential impact from any unannounced future transactions other than capital recycling activities.

Further, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of any such forward-looking statement contained in this release, and such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our reliance on a concentration of a small number of tenants and operators for a significant percentage of our revenues; the financial condition of our existing and future tenants, operators and borrowers, including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses, and their legal and regulatory proceedings, which results in uncertainties regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such tenants' and operators' leases and borrowers' loans; the ability of our existing and future tenants, operators and borrowers to conduct their respective businesses in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase their revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us and our ability to recover investments made, if applicable, in their operations; competition for the acquisition and financing of suitable healthcare properties as well as competition for tenants and operators, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases; our concentration in the healthcare property sector, particularly in senior housing, life sciences and medical office buildings, which makes our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn in a specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries; our ability to identify replacement tenants and operators and the potential renovation costs and regulatory approvals associated therewith; the risks associated with property development and redevelopment, including costs above original estimates, project delays and lower occupancy rates and rents than expected; the risks associated with our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities, including our lack of sole decision making authority and our reliance on our partners' financial condition and continued cooperation; our ability to achieve the benefits of acquisitions and other investments, including those discussed above, within expected time frames or at all, or within expected cost projections; the potential impact on us and our tenants, operators and borrowers from current and future litigation matters, including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs, adverse results and related developments; operational risks associated with third party management contracts, including the additional regulation and liabilities of our RIDEA lease structures; the effect on us and our tenants and operators of legislation, executive orders and other legal requirements, including compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, fire, safety and health regulations, environmental laws, the Affordable Care Act, licensure, certification and inspection requirements, and laws addressing entitlement programs and related services, including Medicare and Medicaid, which may result in future reductions in reimbursements or fines for noncompliance; changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations, including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase the costs, or otherwise affect the operations, of our tenants and operators; our ability to foreclose on collateral securing our real estate-related loans; volatility or uncertainty in the capital markets, the availability and cost of capital as impacted by interest rates, changes in our credit ratings, and the value of our common stock, and other conditions that may adversely impact our ability to fund our obligations or consummate transactions, or reduce the earnings from potential transactions; changes in global, national and local economic or other conditions, including currency exchange rates; our ability to manage our indebtedness level and changes in the terms of such indebtedness; competition for skilled management and other key personnel; the potential impact of uninsured or underinsured losses; our reliance on information technology systems and the potential impact of system failures, disruptions or breaches; the ability to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
