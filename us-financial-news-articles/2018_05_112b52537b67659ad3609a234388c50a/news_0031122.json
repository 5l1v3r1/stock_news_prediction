(NASDAQ: CRESY, BASE: CRES), today announces results for the IIIQ FY 2018 ended March 31, 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nNet result for 9M18 registered a gain of ARS 10,604 million compared to a gain of ARS 6,516 million in 9M17 (Attributable to Cresud ARS 4,796 million in 9M18 vs. ARS 2,243 million in 9M17) mainly explained by higher agricultural operating results, higher results from changes in the fair value of investment properties coming from the Argentinean business center of our subsidiary IRSA, compensated by a non-cash loss in Israel business center due to a debt exchange at Discount Corporation Ltd. The result of the Agricultural Production segment increased ARS 681 million during the 9M compared period due to a larger planted area, better prices, controlled costs and average yields due to good weather conditions in Brazil and Paraguay, while Argentina and Bolivia presented more adverse conditions. We have increased the planted crop area in the region to 208.258 ha and we expect to transform into productive 10.662 ha in the consolidated region. In relation to Farmland sales, we'll recognize in 4Q18 the result of \"La Esmeralda\" farm sale in Argentina for USD 19 million announced during IQ18 and Brasilagro's recent partial sale of Araucaria farm for BRL 61.6 million expecting to concrete new farmland sales in the last quarter of FY2018.
