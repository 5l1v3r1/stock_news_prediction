Officers of the Washington Department of Fish and Game tracked the cat with dogs and killed it, Abbott said.\nThe survivor was taken to hospital in Seattle with serious but none-life-threatening injuries, he said.\nFatal cougar attacks are extremely rare in North America, with only about two dozen recorded in the last 100 years, most of them involving children.\nIt was only the second deadly attack by a mountain lion in Washington State in the last 100 years, Abbott said.\nCougars are the fourth largest cat species worldwide, with adult females weighing up to 141 pounds (64 kgs) and males weighing as much as 220 pounds (100 kgs). They attack prey by ambush and usually attack humans only if cornered.\nReporting By Andrew Hay in Taos, New Mexico; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T05:00:58.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
