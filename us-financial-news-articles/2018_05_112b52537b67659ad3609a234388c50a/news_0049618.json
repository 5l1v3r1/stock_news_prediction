Because compelling stories about the trailblazers need to be told,” the organisation’s co-founder Jo Bostock said.\n“They set the pace and show what’s possible. Most importantly they stimulate other brands, sport and the media to step up and take action. Building this momentum will ensure the future of women’s sport.”\nThe England women’s cricket team won the ICC World Cup last year by beating India in the final, a match watched by no less than 1.1 million TV viewers across the UK.\nFormer athlete and double Olympian Lorna Boothe was named Ambassador of Women’s Sport while the England and Wales Cricket Board was named National Governing Body of the Year.\nFormer England rugby captain and founding member of the Rugby Football Union for Women Carol Isherwood picked up the award for Outstanding Contribution to Women’s Sport.
