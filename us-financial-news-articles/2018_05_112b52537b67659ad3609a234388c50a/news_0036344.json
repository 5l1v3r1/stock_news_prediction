Efforts to locate an attorney for Goulart were unsuccessful.\nThe charges, which are under seal, accuse Goulart of leaking internal Prosecutors Office information to Batista and Assis to ease their negotiations for a plea deal.\nUnder terms of their plea deal signed a year ago, Batista, who at the time headed family holding J&F Investimentos SA, and Assis confessed to certain corruption crimes and were exempted from prosecution for their cooperation.\nSupreme Court Justice Edson Fachin is considering whether to annul the plea deal, analysing a request made by former prosecutor general Rodrigo Janot last September during his final days in office.
