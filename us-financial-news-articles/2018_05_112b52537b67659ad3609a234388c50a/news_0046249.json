They also are home to the critically endangered Saiga antelope.\nAlmost all are in Central Asia, with a vast majority in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, according to the United Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO).\nThe degradation must be addressed, warned the FAO.\n“If we do not reverse it, people will start leaving because there will be no livelihood in these areas,” said Yuriko Shoji, deputy regional representative for Europe & Central Asia for the FAO, which organized the conference.\nThe Aral Sea is an extreme example of what could happen if actions are not taken, Shoji said.\nOnce the world’s fourth biggest lake, it has shrunk by 70 percent in recent decades in what environmentalists describe as one of the worst man-made ecological disasters.\nReporting by Thin Lei Win, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
