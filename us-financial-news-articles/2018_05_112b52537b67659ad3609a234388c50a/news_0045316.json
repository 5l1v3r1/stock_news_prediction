About 70 percent of Nippon Steel’s exports goes to Asia.\nThe hefty U.S. steel tariffs could make Southeast Asia the new hunting ground for global exporters seeking buyers, industry officials and traders say, creating a glut that could depress prices and prompt some producers to close.\nFor now, Miyamoto is upbeat about Asian steel demand.\n“Japan’s demand in construction and automobiles is solid. In China, consumer spending is also strong and there are lots of infrastructure projects such as subways and apartments near the stations,” he said.\nGiven a healthy demand outlook and its increased spending to upgrade ageing facilities, Nippon Steel plans to boost its crude steel output, on parent basis, to more than 42.6 million tonnes in the current year to March 2019, from 40.67 million tonnes a year ago.\nThe company also aims to improve margins by hiking product prices to help absorb rising costs of auxiliary materials such as manganese and zinc and distribution expenses, Miyamoto said.\nThe steelmaker did not provide an earnings forecast. A Thomson Reuters survey of 13 analysts has forecast a mean recurring profit of 351 billion yen ($3.17 billion) for the current year, against 297.5 billion yen last year.\nAmong acquisition plans announced earlier this year by Nippon Steel, world’s No.4 steelmaker, include Sweden’s Ovako, India’s bankrupt Essar Steel and its subsidiaries Nisshin Steel and Sanyo Special Steel.\nAnd Miyamoto said the company is optimistic about winning the bidding race for Essar as Nippon Steel’s teamup with ArcelorMittal could help the Indian firm’s quick restructuring, upgrading of factories while also giving financial support.\n($1 = 110.8300 yen)\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi and Ritsuko Shimizu; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T20:24:32.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
