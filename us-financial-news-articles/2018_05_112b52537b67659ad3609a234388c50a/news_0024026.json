[GBP/]\nMost BoE rate-setters said they should wait for evidence that Britain’s economy was recovering from a weak start to the year before raising interest rates.\nFive-year British government bond yields GB5YT=RR, sensitive to expectations for BoE rates, slid almost seven basis points after the decision to approach a three month low, and last stood at 1.13 percent, down four basis points on the day.\n“(Policymakers) seem to have back-pedalled on their hawkishness from February. The market was priced for that anyway but the fact they seemed so uncertain about the data - they clearly have low levels of confidence about it,” Jason Simpson, fixed income strategist at Societe Generale said.\nOvernight interest swaps now price in a chance of just over 10 percent that the BoE will not raise interest rates at all this year - with a rate hike delayed until early 2019 - compared with a near-certainty of a 2018 rate rise earlier.
