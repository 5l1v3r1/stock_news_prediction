It also aids the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to estimate future medical need for controlled substances.\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has asked the company to have a third-party auditor review the quality control measures on IQVIA drug sales data as well as all other products of the company used by the regulator.\nThe agency also said it will brief members of Congress on IQVIA’s data quality issues and their potential impact on public health.\nIQVIA did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
