The new framework takes effect on June 1.\nThe gains were greatest at the long end of the curve according to Tradeweb data, with the May 2040 issue up 1 cent to 95 cents in the dollar, a two-week high.\nThe February 2045 eurobond gained 1.3 cents to trade at 92.8 cents in the dollar, also a two-week high.\nFor years the central bank has relied on multiple rates to set borrowing costs, creating a complex system that many economists say has made policy less predictable.\nReporting by Claire Milhench; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:08:52.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
