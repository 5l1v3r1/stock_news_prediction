But that may not be enough to withstand the next recession, Malloy noted.\n“Despite these concerns, this budget contains many things to be proud of, it was adopted on time, and I am hopeful that its problems can be addressed,” he wrote in a letter to the General Assembly posted online alongside notification that he had signed the bill.\nLawmakers adjust the spending plan during their legislative session before the start of the second year in the state’s biennial budget process.\nLast year, the two-year budget for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was four months late, leading to chaos for some school districts and social service providers in particular.\nMalloy, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election this year after serving two terms in office.\nReporting by Hilary Russ in New York Editing by Matthew Lewis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
