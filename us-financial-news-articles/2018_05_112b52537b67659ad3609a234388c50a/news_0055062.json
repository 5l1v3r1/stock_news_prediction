And in the middle of the race you’re going to think I’m awesome, and then it’s going to get three degrees hotter, and you’re going to go, where did that car go?\n“Everybody is really worried. Everybody is on the edge.”\nThe sizzling conditions will also present challenges for fans and workers.\nWith 300,000-plus spectators expected to fill the sprawling speedway, police and emergency personnel are bracing themselves for a long day.\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway officials have repeatedly warned spectators of heat dangers and to take precautions.\nOfficials also warned that security, on heightened alert following a shooting at a nearby middle school on Friday, will again be tight and fans should be prepared for queues.
