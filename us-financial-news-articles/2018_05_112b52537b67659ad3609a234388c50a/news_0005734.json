As a result, the judge did not render a decision on the merits of our case,” John Ryan, president and CEO of CSBS, said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe fintech community has been watching closely to see if Joseph Otting, appointed Comptroller of the Currency in November, would push ahead with a charter to allow fintech firms to do business nationwide that was first announced in 2016 by his predecessor, Thomas Curry.\nOtting said at a conference in Washington last month that the regulator was aiming to publish its position on the charter within the next 60 to 90 days.\nA spokesman for the OCC declined to comment on the decision. But he said in a statement on Tuesday that if the agency does push ahead with such a charter, fintech firms would be supervised in line with similar, traditional banks “with appropriate requirements for capital, liquidity, and meeting the financial needs of its customers.”\nReporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T21:12:21.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
