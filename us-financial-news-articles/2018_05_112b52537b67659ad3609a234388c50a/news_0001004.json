Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive a fixed ratio of 0.10256 of a TMUS share for each Sprint share they own; representing consideration of $5.14 based on TMUS' May 1 closing price.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether Sprint's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $7.00 per Sprint share. Additionally, the Company's shares traded for $8.55, or nearly $2.00 above the per-share consideration, as recently as September of 2017.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether Sprint's Board acted in the best interests of Sprint's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own Sprint shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.
