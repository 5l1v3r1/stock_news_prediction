He called on people to remain calm.\nStreets around the bombed churches were blocked by checkpoints and heavily armed police stood guard as forensic and bomb squad officers combed the area for clues.\nTelevision footage showed one church where the yard in front was engulfed in fire with thick, black smoke billowing up. A large blast was heard hours after the attacks, which Mangera said was a bomb disposal squad dealing with a device.\nJAIL STANDOFF The attacks are the deadliest in Indonesia linked to Islamic State and the worst since October 2005, when three suicide bombers blew themselves up in Bali restaurants killing 20.\nThey came days after militant Islamist prisoners killed five members of an elite counter-terrorism force during a 36-hour standoff at a high-security jail near Jakarta.\nPolice Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters that because many militant leaders had been captured “these groups are starting to ... retaliate.”\nWawan Purwanto, communication director at Indonesia’s intelligence agency, said the main target of militants remained the security forces, but “there are alternative (targets) if the main targets are blocked”.\nPolice stand guard near the site of a blast at the Pentecost Church Central Surabaya (GPPS), in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia May 13, 2018 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Moch Asim / via REUTERS At St Mary’s catholic church, the first place of worship to be attacked, the bombing happened after an earlier mass was over and when the church was getting ready to hold another service.\nSeparately, an internal police report reviewed by Reuters said a suspected bomb exploded in a car in the parking lot of a Pentacostal church, setting alight dozens of motorbikes.\nIn the third location, the Indonesian Christian Church, veiled women entered the church’s yard where they were stopped by a security guard before an explosion occurred at the same spot, according to the police report.\nPOPE OFFERS PRAYERS Jeirry Sumampow, a spokesman for Indonesia’s church association (PGI), called on the government for more help for security at churches.\nPope Francis offered his prayers for the victims.\n“I am particularly close to the dear people of Indonesia, especially to the communities of Christians of the city of Surabaya, which were hit hard by the serious attack on places of worship,” he said during his Sunday prayer in Rome.\n“Together we invoke the God of peace (asking him) to cease these violent actions and (to make sure) that in the heart of all there could be a space not feelings of hatred and violence, but of reconciliation and fraternity.”\nNearly 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but the country is also home to sizeable communities of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and people who adhere to traditional beliefs.\nIndonesia has had some major successes tackling militancy inspired by al Qaeda’s attacks on the United States in 2001. But there has been a resurgence of Islamist attacks in recent years, including in January 2016 when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in central Jakarta.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Churches have also been targeted previously, including near-simultaneous attacks over Christmas in 2000 that killed about 20 people.\nGRAPHIC: here\nAdditional reporting by Fransiska Nangoy, Agustinus Beo Da Costa, Gayatri Suroyo, Francesca Landini and Sami Aboudi; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Lincoln Feast.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T08:02:50.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
