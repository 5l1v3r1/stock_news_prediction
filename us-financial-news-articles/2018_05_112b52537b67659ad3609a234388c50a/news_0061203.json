REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo In its periodic “Beige Book” summary of contacts with businesses in its 12 regional districts, the U.S. central bank pointed to strong output in fabricated metals, heavy machinery and electronics equipment.\nThe assessment of growth across the economy represented a slight upgrade from the Fed’s prior Beige Book report, which said economic activity was expanding at a “modest to moderate pace.”\n“Manufacturing shifted into higher gear,” the Fed said in its latest report.\nMore than half of the Fed’s districts reported a pickup in industrial activity, and a third of them reported the activity as “strong.”\nStill, manufacturers worried that tensions between the United States and its trading partners, notably China, could lead to higher tariffs across the world.\n“The major concern manufacturers expressed was trade policy,” the Fed said, referring to comments from business contacts in its Boston district, where a maker of testing equipment said it might move some production to Europe to avoid Chinese retaliation for increases in U.S. tariffs.\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s contacts said they were worried about how recent tariff announcements on steel and aluminum could affect supply chains. The Trump administration has announced tariffs on steel imports from many countries including China while Beijing has targeted U.S. aluminum and other goods.\nOnly the Dallas Fed found overall economic activity had “sped up to a solid pace,” according to the report. Across the country, growth in auto sales was flat and retail sales excluding autos eased.\nThe Fed’s districts reported modest-to-moderate growth in employment while contacts said the labor market remained tight. Wage increases, however, were reported to be modest.\nThe Beige Book was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on information collected on or before May 21.\nReporting by Jason Lange Editing by Paul Simao\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
