It counts Home Depot as its biggest merchant.\nIn 2016, the company began expanding into elective healthcare to target creditworthy consumers who make large purchases. Elective healthcare includes clinics providing cosmetic and aesthetic surgeries, reproductive medicine, dentistry and veterinary medicine.\nGreenSky's 2017 revenue jumped 23.5 percent year-over-year to $325.9 million, while profit rose 11.4 percent to $138.7 million as transaction volumes surged 31 percent.\nFollowing the IPO, CEO David Zalik will hold 47.68 percent of voting power at the company, GreenSky said in its IPO filing https://bit.ly/2J5J49Q .\nGoldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are among the main underwriting banks on GreenSky's IPO.
