The information board is seen at the gate to the migrants home in Ellwangen, Germany May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Ayhan Uyanik\nMore than 1.6 million migrants, many from the Middle East, have arrived in Germany since 2014, prompting concerns about social cohesion and security, and boosting support for the far-right Alternative for Germany, which entered the national parliament for the first time in last year’s election.\nIn April, prosecutors said they were investigating the former head of BAMF’s Bremen office, who is suspected of granting asylum to some 1,200 people who did not qualify for it, the majority of them members of the Yazidi ethnic group.\nSeveral German media on Sunday said the BAMF was now reviewing 10 out of its 70 outposts and cited an Interior Ministry spokeswoman as saying 8,500 asylum decisions from 2017 were being checked.\nBild am Sonntag (BamS) newspaper said, without citing its sources, that 13 outposts were being reviewed.\nNeither the BAMF nor Interior Ministry were immediately available for comment.\nDeputy Interior Minister Stephan Mayer has said certificates of recognition will be annulled where necessary if legally possible.
