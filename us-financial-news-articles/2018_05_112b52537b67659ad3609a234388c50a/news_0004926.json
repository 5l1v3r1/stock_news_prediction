And, through Readiness, we are enhancing our agility, streamlining and standardizing our processes, and implementing innovative technologies for our business and our customers.\n“The consistent execution of our strategic plan, combined with our first quarter results, improving market conditions for many of our businesses, and the benefits of U.S. tax reform, lead us to be even more confident about 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\n2018 2017 (Amounts in millions except per share data) Earnings per share (as reported) $ 0.70 $ 0.59 Adjusted earnings per share 1 $ 0.68 $ 0.60 Segment operating profit $ 704 $ 676 Adjusted segment operating profit 1 $ 717 $ 678 Origination 45 47 Oilseeds 350 313 Carbohydrate Solutions 213 211 Nutrition 96 77 Other 13 30 EPS as reported of $0.70 includes a $0.02 per share charge related to asset impairment and restructuring activities, a positive $0.03 per share tax adjustment related to U.S. tax reform, and a positive $0.01 per share adjustment related to LIFO. Adjusted EPS, which excludes these items, was $0.68. 1 Reported and adjusted earnings include negative mark-to-market timing effects in Oilseeds and Origination, largely offset by approximately $120 million of income from the 2017 U.S. biodiesel tax credit.\n1 Non-GAAP financial measures; see pages 4, 9 and 10 for explanations and reconciliations, including after-tax amounts.\nResults of Operations\nOrigination results were in line with the prior year. Negative timing effects that impacted the quarter’s performance are expected to reverse in future quarters as contracted agreements are executed.\nMerchandising and Handling was up significantly year-over-year. Global Trade had higher margins and increased volumes, resulting in a significant turnaround compared to the year-ago period. North American Grain was down compared to the first quarter of 2017 on lower U.S. export volumes and approximately $40 million of mark-to-market effects on existing contracts due to improvements in forward export margins and barge freight rates; those impacts are expected to reverse in future quarters as contracts are executed.\nTransportation was down due to high river levels, resulting in increased operating costs.\nOilseeds results were up over the first quarter of 2017.\nGlobal market dynamics continued to push soybean crush margins higher, and the company set crush volume records in North and South America. Improving crush margins resulted in negative timing effects of more than $100 million on forward hedges, which led to Crushing and Origination results that were lower than the year-ago period; the majority of those impacts are expected to reverse over the course of 2018. South America saw strong origination volumes and improving margins as farmer selling accelerated. Softseeds were down on lower margins.\nRefining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other results were substantially higher on approximately $120 million of income due to the passage of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit.\nAsia was lower on Wilmar results.\nCarbohydrate Solutions results were in line with the year-ago quarter.\nStarches and Sweeteners was up over the prior year on increasing contributions from the Chamtor acquisition and solid results from joint ventures in North America, as well as improved results from starches and dry sweeteners. Wheat Milling was up, benefiting from stronger margins.\nBioproducts results were down versus the year-ago quarter in a pressured ethanol industry margin environment.\nNutrition was up versus the year-ago period.\nWFSI results were in line with the first quarter of 2017. WILD had another quarter of double-digit profit increases versus the prior-year period, offset by some weakness in Specialty Ingredients.\nAnimal Nutrition was up significantly over the first quarter of 2017 with strong trade sales, and a good product mix with strong margins.\nOther results decreased due to lower underwriting performance in captive insurance operations and lower results at ADM Investor Services.\nOther Items of Note\nADM made changes to its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2018 to reflect the company’s new operating structure. To assist in reconciling the new segment results to the prior presentation, the table on page 11 provides financial information under the historical segmentation for the first quarter of 2018.\nAs additional information to help clarify underlying business performance, the table on page 9 includes reported earnings and EPS as well as adjusted earnings and EPS.\nSegment operating profit of $704 million for the quarter includes charges of $13 million ($0.02 per share) related to asset impairment and restructuring charges.\nIn Corporate results, unallocated corporate costs for the quarter increased due to a $19 million expenditure with an offsetting benefit in income taxes.\nOther charges for the quarter in Corporate include several individually insignificant restructuring charges totaling $3 million, compared with last year’s restructuring charges of $1 million.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 15 percent, down from approximately 26 percent in the prior year, due mainly to U.S. tax reform, which reduced the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. In addition, there were favorable changes in the forecasted mix of pre-tax earnings; the effects of the biodiesel credit; and certain discrete tax items.\nConference Call Information\nADM will host a webcast on May 1, 2018, at 8 a.m. Central Time to discuss financial results and provide a company update.

Adjusted segment operating profit, a non-GAAP measure, is segment operating profit excluding specified items and timing effects.

Management believes that segment operating profit and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of ADM’s performance because they provide investors information about ADM’s business unit performance excluding corporate overhead costs as well as specified items and significant timing effects. Segment operating profit and adjusted segment operating profit are not measures of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to income before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings (unaudited)\nQuarter ended March 31 2018 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues $ 15,526 $ 14,988 Cost of products sold 14,637 14,116 Gross profit 889 872 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 513 516 Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs 16 10 Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates (147 ) (172 ) Interest income (33 ) (23 ) Interest expense 91 81 Other (income) expense - net (15 ) 2 Earnings before income taxes 464 458 Income tax expense (68 ) (118 ) Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 396 340 Less: Net earnings (losses) attributable to noncontrolling interests 3 1 Net earnings attributable to ADM $ 393 $ 339 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.70 $ 0.59 Average number of shares outstanding 565 579 Quarter ended March 31 2018 2017 (in millions) Other (income) expense - net consists of:\nGains on sales of assets (a) $ (6 ) $ (16 ) Other - net (b) (9 ) 18 $ (15 ) $ 2 (a) Current quarter net gains include individually insignificant disposals in Carbohydrate Solutions ($2 million), Oilseeds ($1 million), and Origination ($4 million) partially offset by a loss in Corporate ($1 million) .

(b) Current quarter charges of $16 million pretax ($12 million after tax) primarily related to the impairment of an equity investment and restructuring charges, tax effected using the applicable tax rates. Prior quarter charges of $10 million pretax ($8 million after tax) related to impairment of certain long-lived assets and restructuring charges, tax effected using the applicable tax rates.

Adjusted net earnings reflects ADM’s reported net earnings after removal of the effect on net earnings of certain specified items as more fully described above. Adjusted EPS reflects ADM’s fully diluted EPS after removal of the effect on EPS as reported of certain specified items as more fully described above. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted EPS are useful measures of ADM’s performance because they provide investors additional information about ADM’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace or be alternatives to net earnings and EPS as reported, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, or any other measures of operating results under GAAP. Earnings amounts described above have been divided by the company’s diluted shares outstanding for each respective period in order to arrive at an adjusted EPS amount for each specified item.\nAdjusted Return on Invested Capital A non-GAAP financial measure (unaudited)\nAdjusted ROIC Earnings (in millions) Four Quarters Quarter Ended Ended June 30, 2017 Sep. 30, 2017 Dec. 31, 2017 Mar. 31, 2018 Mar. 31, 2018 Net earnings attributable to ADM $ 276 $ 192 $ 788 $ 393 $ 1,649 Adjustments: Interest expense 86 79 84 91 340 LIFO 9 — 2 (8 ) 3 Other adjustments (3) 20 106 (303 ) 2 (175 ) Total adjustments 115 185 (217 ) 85 168 Tax on adjustments (13 ) (70 ) (55 ) (35 ) (173 ) Net adjustments 102 115 (272 ) 50 (5 ) Total Adjusted ROIC Earnings $ 378 $ 307 $ 516 $ 443 $ 1,644 Adjusted Invested Capital (in millions) Quarter Ended Trailing Four June 30, 2017 Sep. 30, 2017 Dec. 31, 2017 Mar. 31, 2018 Quarter Average Equity (1) $ 17,411 $ 17,570 $ 18,313 $ 18,732 $ 18,007 + Interest-bearing liabilities (2) 6,980 7,336 7,493 9,000 7,702 + LIFO adjustment (net of tax) 44 44 46 49 46 Other adjustments (3) 43 66 (326 ) (2 ) (55 ) Total Adjusted Invested Capital $ 24,478 $ 25,016 $ 25,526 $ 27,779 $ 25,700 Adjusted Return on Invested Capital 6.4 % (1) Excludes noncontrolling interests\n(2) Includes short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt\n(3) Includes the impact of U.S. tax reform\nAdjusted ROIC is Adjusted ROIC earnings divided by adjusted invested capital. Adjusted ROIC earnings is ADM’s net earnings adjusted for the after tax effects of interest expense, changes in the LIFO reserve and other specified items. Adjusted invested capital is the sum of ADM’s equity (excluding noncontrolling interests) and interest-bearing liabilities adjusted for the after tax effect of the LIFO reserve, and other specified items. Management believes Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure because it provides investors information about ADM’s returns excluding the impacts of LIFO inventory reserves and other specified items and increases period-to-period comparability of underlying business performance. Management uses Adjusted ROIC to measure ADM’s performance by comparing Adjusted ROIC to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Adjusted ROIC, Adjusted ROIC earnings and Adjusted invested capital are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace or be alternatives to GAAP financial measures.\nSegment Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit (a non-GAAP measure) as Currently Reported vs Previous Segments (unaudited)\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 As Currently As Currently Reported Pro Forma Reported Pro Forma (In millions) Segment Operating Profit Segment Operating Profit $ 704 $ 704 Less specified items: Less specified items: Impairment and restructuring charges Impairment and restructuring charges 13 13 Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Adjusted Segment Operating Profit $ 717 $ 717 Origination Agricultural Services $ 45 $ 89 Merchandising and handling Merchandising and handling 42 40 Transportation Transportation 3 3 Milling and Other — 46 Oilseeds Oilseeds $ 350 $ 352 Crushing and origination Crushing and origination 68 67 Refining, packaging, biodiesel, & other Refining, packaging, biodiesel, & other 173 175 Asia Asia 109 110 Carbohydrate Solutions Corn Processing $ 213 $ 190 Starches and sweeteners Sweeteners and Starches 216 172 Bioproducts Bioproducts (3 ) 18 Nutrition Wild Flavors & Specialty Ingredients $ 96 $ 73 WFSI Wild Flavors & Specialty Ingredients 73 73 Animal Nutrition 23 — Other Other $ 13 $ 13 Segment operating profit is ADM’s consolidated income from operations before income tax excluding corporate items.
