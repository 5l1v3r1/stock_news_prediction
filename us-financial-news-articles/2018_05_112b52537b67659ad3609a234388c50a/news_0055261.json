Colorado rallied to take a 2-1 lead in the third on Dahl’s double off the wall in center.\nCruz gave Cincinnati the lead right back in the fourth with his first homer of the season, a two-run shot to left that went an estimated 449 feet.\nThe Rockies took a 4-3 lead in the fifth when Charlie Blackmon had an RBI triple and scored on Dahl’s sacrifice fly.\nCincinnati got to Colorado’s usually reliable bullpen in the seventh. Scott Schebler led off with a single and Billy Hamilton tripled to center off Rusin.\nBryan Shaw relieved Rusin and allowed an RBI single to Jose Peraza to put the Reds ahead 5-4. Gennett’s single put runners on the corners, and Peraza scored on a wild pitch to make it a two-run game.\nNolan Arenado led off the eighth with a double off David Hernandez, moved to third on a wild pitch and scored on Gerardo Parra’s groundout.\n—Field Level Media\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-27T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:29:35.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
