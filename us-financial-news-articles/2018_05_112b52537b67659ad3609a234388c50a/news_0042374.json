But this is not a game-changing decision, say some industry observers.\n\"Reducing the import duty from 25 percent to 15 percent looks big on paper,\" said Michael Dunne, president of China-based auto consultancy Dunne Automotive. \"But the domestic auto industry will continue to enjoy considerable protection.\"\nIn 2017, 97 percent of vehicles sold in China were built in China, he added. \"The lower tariff might move that a few percentage points south, but that's all,\" Dunne said. \"This is no breakthrough event.\"\nFormer GM Chairman Bob Lutz also called the move a \"good start\" but said he did not think it was going to have a big impact on U.S. exports. This in part because many major automakers, such as Ford and GM, already make vehicles in China through partnerships with local companies.\n\"I think it is a good halfway step, when you consider that our automotive tariffs in the United States for imports are 2Â½ percent,\" Lutz said Tuesday morning on CNBC's \" Squawk Alley .\" \"I would say they have got a way to go.\"\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to place tariffs on imports from China, which far outweigh U.S. exports in to the country. China has retaliated by announcing tariffs on some U.S. products. The moves have stoked fears of a trade war between the two countries.
