In May, it estimated its full-year net loss to be about 1.2 billion zlotys.\nThe court has opened an accelerated restructuring procedure over GetBack, while the financial market regulator has submitted to the prosecutor’s office a notice of offence in relation to the company’s activities.\n$1 = 3.7600 zlotys Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
