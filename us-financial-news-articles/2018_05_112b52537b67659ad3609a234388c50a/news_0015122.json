The government now aims to change that, partly because it wants to use the leisure sector to create jobs and diversify the economy beyond oil exports.\nAlthough DIEC, with initial funding of 10 billion riyals ($2.7 billion) provided by the deep-pocketed Public Investment Fund, will take the lead in major entertainment industry projects, Dawood stressed that it intended all of its projects to be commercially viable.\nLast month, DIEC and U.S. theater operator AMC Entertainment Holding staged the first public showing of a commercial movie in almost 40 years as a ban on cinemas was lifted.\nA few days later, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attended the ground-breaking ceremony for a huge resort area near Riyadh that is to feature a Six Flags theme park, water parks, motor sports and cultural events.\nDawood, also chief executive of Al Tayyar Travel Group, one of Saudi Arabia’s top travel companies, said on Sunday that DIEC also planned to establish two other clusters of theme parks: one in the Jeddah area and one on the other side of the country in Eastern Province.\nReporting by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T23:48:00.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
