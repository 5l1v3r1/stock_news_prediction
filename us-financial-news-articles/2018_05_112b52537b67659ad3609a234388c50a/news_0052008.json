She can help us with that.”\nThe Black Ferns sevens team, who compete at the Olympics, have received national contracts for a number of years, but the new deal for 15s players has been seen as pivotal for women’s sport in New Zealand.\n“It’s an exciting time for women’s rugby and I’m very proud we’ve taken the step forward to contract our female 15s players along with our sevens squad,” NZR’s head of women’s rugby Cate Sexton said.\nThe Black Ferns face Australia in two matches in August, both as curtain-raisers to the first two Rugby Championship tests between the two nations’ men’s sides, the All Blacks and the Wallabies.\nThe Black Ferns will also play the United States in Chicago in November, with further matches to be confirmed.
