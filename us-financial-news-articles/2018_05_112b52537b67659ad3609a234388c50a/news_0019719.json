With fully-funded plans for 970,000 sq. ft. of production, the company could produce upwards of 116,000 kilograms of premium organic cannabis per year, making it among the largest licensed producers. Investors may want to take a closer look at the company following its successful IPO.\nSuccessful IPO\nThe Green Organic Dutchman successfully completed its initial public offering of 31,510,000 units at a price of $3.65 per unit for gross proceeds of $115,011,500. Each unit consists of a common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant, with the warrant being exercisable at a price of $7.00 per common share for a period of two years. The company also has an acceleration right if the stock price exceeds $9.00 for any ten day period.\nEnormous Footprint & Production\nThe Green Organic Dutchman has one of the largest land packages in the industry and is building a laboratory dedicated to oil extraction in Ontario, a genetics and breeding center in Quebec, and a cultivation facility in each province.\nThe two production facilities include:\nQuebec Project - A 75-acre property located near Montreal, Quebec, with an 820,000 sq. ft. high tech hybrid facility capable of producing 102,000 kilograms of high-quality organic cannabis per year. With access to $0.04 kWh electricity, the facility will be one of the lowest cost producers in the entire country. The company secured initial construction permits in December 2017 and began construction in January 2018.\nOntario Project - The company’s existing facility in Ontario will be expanded to 150,000 sq. ft., which will boost production capacity to 14,000 kilograms per year. In addition, its agreement with Hamilton Utility will lower its electricity costs from 13 cents per kWh to just five cents per kWh. Construction of an oil extraction facility is also well underway.\nThese world-class projects could make the company a leading licensed producer of medical - and soon recreational - cannabis over the coming year. Unlike many cannabis projects, both of these facilities are fully funded to 116,000 kilograms of annual production, which limits dilution for existing shareholders and execution risk for new investors. The agri-park style developments also open the door for joint ventures, licensing, and distribution agreements in the future.\nHigh Quality, Low Cost, Organic Product\nOrganic foods are a growing market subset, evidenced last year when Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. That trend transfers to the cannabis market as well. More than 60 percent of Canadian consumers considering recreational cannabis believe that consuming organically-grown and processed product is important, according to Hill+Knowlton Strategies. The company estimates that organic products sell at a nearly 30 percent premium to non-organic products, but only about five percent of licensed producers provide organic products, which creates an enormous market opportunity.\nThe Green Organic Dutchman is focused exclusively on organic production that avoids synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, and/or irradiated products. While several licensed producers have experienced product recalls, the company believes that its products will set a new standard for quality while remaining competitive in terms of price, due to its low electricity rates, efficient use of water, and its focus on sustainability and operational efficiency.\nThe company’s facilities are setting the industry standard for sustainability. The buildings are LEED certified, equipped with high-efficiency LEDs to reduce energy consumption and heat as well as in-house power generation with natural gas. Management is also working with the Grand River Conservation Authority for habitat creation and protecting species at risk, while collecting and reusing ~90 percent of its water and drawing the rest from natural on-site wells.\nStrong Management & Partnerships\nThe Green Organic Dutchman’s management team has decades of experience in finance, plant cultivation, and consumer products. Chairman & CEO Rob Anderson has 22 years of experience in the capital markets, having raised $400 million for cannabis companies over the past 2 years.\nVP of Growing Operations David Perron led the first Canadian certified organic licensed producer, at Whistler Medical Marijuana Corporation, before joining the company.\nIn addition, Head Grower Amer Cheema has 20+ years of experience in greenhouse vegetable production and won several awards for high production and best quality of greenhouse produce.\nStrength in Consumer Packaged Goods\nThe Green Organic Dutchman’s latest round of staff additions highlight the company’s commitment to the emerging retail market for cannabis-based consumer products. Brian Athaide, new CFO, comes most recently from Andrew Peller Limited, one of Canada’s leading consumer alcohol companies. He also served as Finance Director and CFO for Procter & Gamble, involved with multi-billion dollar international consumer products. Other key hires in sales, marketing and operations draw heavily from the beverage and consumer packaged goods sectors.\n“We are very proud to introduce these new additions to the TGOD team. These individuals bring a vast amount of experience and proven success in their respective fields. TGOD’s ability to attract this outstanding talent is a testament to our vision and strategic plan. With our President Csaba Reider, TGOD now has over 125 years of combined consumer packaged goods experience from industry leading companies. The breadth and depth of experience on our management team will enable the Company to execute on its goal of becoming the world’s largest organic cannabis producer,” said Robert Anderson, TGOD’s Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chairman.\nThe Green Organic Dutchman is 17.62 percent owned by Aurora Cannabis Inc., one of the largest licensed producers in the country. The $55 million cornerstone investment includes an immediate purchase order for 20 percent of The Green Organic Dutchman’s future production while the company also has immediate access to international markets. When it comes time to raise more capital, Aurora may also exercise options to acquire additional shares.\nPlease follow the link to read the full article: http://www.cannabisfn.com/green-organic-dutchman-largest-cannabis-ipo-date/\nAbout CFN Media\nCFN Media (CannabisFN) is the leading agency and financial media network dedicated to the global cannabis industry, helps companies operating in the space attract investors, capital, and publicity.
