(NASDAQ:CSTE), a manufacturer of high quality engineered quartz surfaces, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $136.1 million, approximately flat to the prior year’s first quarter result of $136.4 million; on a constant currency basis, first quarter revenue decreased by 3.7%.\nYair Averbuch, Interim Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our first quarter results fell short of our expectations. We are working with urgency and purpose to improve execution and resume growth. We plan to enhance our execution, particularly in the U.S. market, with a focus on growth and margins. We believe that we have significant opportunities to leverage our global operating platform, powerful global brand, innovative and leading products and our considerable financial strength to return to compelling levels of value creation for our shareholders.”\nGross margin in the first quarter was 25.2% compared to 36.1% in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin primarily reflects: increased product complexity and related manufacturing challenges in Israel; inventory and logistical inefficiencies primarily related to the U.S. distribution operation, the majority of which the company does not expect will continue in the remainder of the year; and higher raw material prices.\nOperating expenses in the first quarter were $32.8 million, or 24.1% of revenue, as compared to $34.1 million, or 25.0% of revenue, in the same quarter last year. Excluding legal settlements and loss contingency expenses, operating expenses would have been 22.3% of revenue as compared to 24.5% in the same quarter last year.\nOperating income in the first quarter was $1.4 million, a margin of 1.0% compared to $15.1 million, a margin of 11.1%, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes expenses for share-based compensation as well as legal settlements and loss contingencies, was $11.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, a margin of 8.2%. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $24.3 million in the prior year’s first quarter, a margin of 17.8%. This year-over-year margin comparison primarily reflects the decline in gross margin, as described above.\nFinance income in the first quarter was $0.5 million compared to finance expense of $1.5 million during the same period in the prior year. The change primarily reflects the benefit of currency in certain financial instruments.\nThe Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest for the first quarter of 2018 of $1.5 million compared to income of $11.1 million in the same quarter in the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the first quarter was $0.05 compared to $0.31 in the prior year's first quarter, both on 34.4 million shares. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the first quarter was $0.10 compared to the prior year’s first quarter level of $0.36.\nThe Company's balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 remained strong, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of $112.1 million as compared to a total of $138.7 million on December 31, 2017 and to $121.0 million on March 31, 2017. The Company noted that during the quarter, it used approximately $14.2 million in cash, as previously announced, to conclude long-standing arbitration as well as $10.5 million in cash for the payment of a previously authorized dividend paid during the first quarter.\nWith regard to the previously announced dividend policy - the Company noted that considering the quarter’s results, it will not pay dividend in the second quarter.\nGuidance\nThe Company today reduced its full-year 2018 guidance to reflect the first quarter results reported today as well as its outlook for the remainder of 2018. The Company now expects full year 2018 revenues in a range of $590 million to $610 million and expects full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $74 million to $82 million.\nConference Call Details\nYair Averbuch, the Company’s interim chief executive officer, and Ophir Yakovian, the Company’s chief financial officer, will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.
