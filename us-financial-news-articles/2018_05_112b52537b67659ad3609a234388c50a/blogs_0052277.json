Last Wednesday, Brazil's central bank unexpectedly kept the benchmark Selic rate at 6.50 percent, defying market expectations of a 25-basis-point cut. In the minutes of that meeting released early on Tuesday, the bank said it had considered a rate cut and acknowledged that the decision came as a surprise to the market. But the bank also indicated that the recent strength of the U.S. dollar had reduced the likelihood of Brazilian inflation remaining below the official target for the foreseeable future. The body also indicated it would likely keep the rate steady in the near future and called Wednesday's rate hold \"the best possible decision.\" \"In the central bank's argument, they say that inflation expectations have become unanchored toward the upside, which is to say that it's no longer necessary to cut the Selic rate,\" said José Francisco Gonçalves, head economist at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo. The real had climbed 0.98 percent by late morning, following a 1.35 percent gain on Monday, after the central bank almost quadrupled the value of its currency swap program. That followed a rough streak for the real, which reached its lowest level in two years on Friday. Elsewhere in Latin America, Chile's peso shot up some 1.27 percent, following global copper prices, which had jumped 1.45 percent by mid-day. Colombia's peso jumped 0.78 percent, boosted by prices for oil, which climbed back over $80 per barrel amid supply constraints.\nEquities markets were relatively flat across the region. Among the major winners on Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index was state electricity utility Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais SA. Its shares rose 4 percent after the nation's electricity regulator approved a power tariff hike.\nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 1446 GMT:\nStock indexes daily % YTD % Latest change change MSCI Emerging Markets 1143.56 0.62 -1.9 MSCI LatAm 2721.91 1.22 -4.92 Brazil Bovespa 81972.79 0.19 7.29 Mexico IPC 45231.07 -0.16 -8.35 Chile IPSA 5664.87 -0.05 1.80 Chile IGPA 28671.63 -0.03 2.47 Argentina MerVal 31588.50 -0.14 5.07 Colombia IGBC 12109.14 0.2 6.49 Venezuela IBC 22940.52 0.63 1716.15 Currencies daily % YTD % change change\nLatest\nBrazil real 3.6525 0.98 -9.29 Mexico peso 19.7655 0.25 -0.34 Chile peso 628.5 1.27 -2.20 Colombia peso 2852.75 0.78 4.53 Peru sol 3.274 0.27 -1.13 Argentina peso 24.3200 0.29 -23.52\n(interbank)\nArgentina peso 25.3 0.40 -23.99\n(parallel)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:16:27.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
