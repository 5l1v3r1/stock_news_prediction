This investment enables Wellist to expand in several key geographic markets and enhance its proprietary digital health platform that connects patients to non-medical support services. Brant Heise, co-head of Summation Health Ventures and Mark Neaman, Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors at NorthShore University Health System, have joined Chuck Farkas and Ashley Reid on Wellist's Board of Directors.\nThe Series A funding builds on an exceptional year for Wellist during which the company added to its roster of hospital system clients, recruited several outstanding executives to the team, and further established its thought leadership in the patient experience market. In addition to Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Wellist recently launched at MemorialCare Health System.\n\"Our investment in Wellist is a reflection of a growing urgency to address patient needs, both inside and outside the hospital, in a more innovative and personalized way,\" said Brant Heise of Summation Health Ventures.\nThe patient experience market has grown increasingly important over the past several years as health care systems shift toward consumer-centric, value-based care models. Driven by the mandate of providing quality care and improved health outcomes, providers are investing in initiatives that address a broader range of patient needs.\n\"Given that less than 20% of outcomes are tied to clinical care, hospitals are increasingly called upon to address the full spectrum of patient support. We are thrilled that this new funding will enable Wellist to help even more clients efficiently and compassionately address the social needs of their patient population,\" said Ashley Reid, Founder and CEO of Wellist.\nAbout Wellist\nWellist is a leading patient experience solutions company that empowers health system leaders to address social determinants of health across their entire patient population. The company's digital marketplace enables hospitals to connect patients and caregivers to vetted non-medical services and crucial information at a time when access to trusted services has a critical impact on the patient and their loved ones. The platform marries proprietary technology, unique data and services to reduce operational costs and improve the experience of patients and staff. Today, Wellist programs span Oncology, OB/Gynecology, NICU, Gerontology, Transplant, Surgery, Primary Care and Cardiology.\nWellist's outstanding contributions have been recognized by organizations including MassTLC (Most Innovative Technology of the Year – Healthcare), Rock Health (Top 50 in Digital Health honoree, Diversity Leadership), American Business Awards (Company of the Year, Silver Stevie – Health Products and Service) and BostInno (50onFire, Health and Medicine winner).\nhttp:/www.wellist.com\nAbout Summation Health Ventures\nSummation Health Ventures is a strategic health care investment fund focused on early- to mid-stage companies offering innovative products, services and technologies which help health care systems significantly improve performance and outcomes.
