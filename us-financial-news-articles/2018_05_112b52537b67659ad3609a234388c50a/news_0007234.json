The change is effective on May 3, Cisco said in a statement .\nThe announcement of Trollope's departure was buried in the fifth paragraph of a press release that was focused on Cisco's $270 million acquisition of Accompany, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence to help companies find new prospects. Accompany founder and CEO Amy Chang is replacing Trollope as head of the collaboration technology group.\ntweet\nTrollope joined Cisco in 2012 after over two decades at Symantec and has been a senior vice president ever since. At Five9, which went public in 2014, Trollope will replace Mike Burkland, who switched from Five9's CEO to its executive chairman in December for health reasons, Five9 said in a statement .\nAbout Trollope, Five9 said, \"During his tenure, his team reinvented Cisco's Collaboration business, pivoting to a SaaS model and making design, simplicity and exponential improvement the guiding principles of product development.\"\nFive9's shares have gained 60 percent in the past year giving it a market value of $1.7 billion.\nâ€” Ari Levy contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T00:13:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
