A small-particle haze hangs above the skyline, with the Eiffel Tower that is seen in the distance, in Paris, France, December 29, 2016. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\nThe High Council for Financial Stability, headed by the finance minister and which also includes the central bank governor, has been concerned about surging corporate debt levels.\nIn December, it announced banks would have to cap their exposure to the most indebted companies at five percent of their capital, once details had been hammered out.\nOn Friday, the council said BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ), Credit Mutuel, BPCE [BPCE.UL] and La Banque Postale [LAPSTE.UL] would be subject to the new limit from July for two years, which could then be renewed.\nIt added that other EU countries were expected to impose the limit on French companies, a move aimed at preventing firms from simply turning to other European banks for credit.\nFrench corporate debt has hit record levels as big firms with easy access to bond markets have binged on cheap credit to finance investments and foreign takeovers.\nCentral bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has repeatedly warned that if borrowing did not slow the council would consider additional credit curbs at its next meeting in June.\nThe central bank said on Friday its latest data showed growth in corporate borrowing picked up in March to 5.2 percent over one year from 5.0 percent in February.\nBond issuance in particular surged 7.3 percent as pharmaceuticals group Sanofi and insurer AXA tapped markets to finance acquisitions.
