That’s a saving for the future - almost all players,” he said.\nHowever, heavy equipment shortages are limiting expansion, particularly for smaller miners, Sjahrir said.\n“In general, getting equipment parts is difficult (and) up to the middle of 2019 it will be difficult to increase production, but for smaller players it will be more difficult because of shortages of financing.”\nSuppliers remain wary of providing equipment to contractors as purchases of costly heavy equipment are often repaid over a period of up to five years, Sjahrir said.\nAccording to Andy Coles, president director of mining services contractor BIS Industries, waiting times for 200-tonne excavators are currently around 12 months.\n“Everyone is looking for equipment,” he said.\nShortages of equipment like trucks, rollers and graders made by Caterpillar Inc, Komatsu and Volvo mean it is harder for miners to ramp up output and take advantage of recent improvements in coal prices, he said.\nThe shortages also threatened to disrupt mining operations, Coles added.\n“When you get rain combined with no maintenance you get a significant deterioration of roads (and) that impacts your hauling equipment, destroys the springs. Engines, everything falls apart.”\nAccording to Indika Energy Group Managing Director Azis Armand, wet weather hit operations of many Indonesian miners in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, but conditions are now improving.\nReporting by Fergus Jensen; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Richard Pullin and Mark Potter\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:31:38.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
