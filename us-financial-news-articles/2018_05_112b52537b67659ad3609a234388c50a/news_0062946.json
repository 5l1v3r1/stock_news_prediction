We are pleased with the start of the second quarter, and based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2018, we are reiterating our full-year guidance. We offer a unique value and convenience proposition that continues to resonate with customers, and we are excited about the initiatives we have in place.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet sales increased 9.0% to $6.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The net sales increase in the first quarter of 2018 was positively affected by the sales contribution from new stores, modestly offset by the impact of store closures. Same-store sales increased 2.1% from the first quarter of 2017 due to an increase in average transaction amount, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. Growth in same-store sales was driven by robust sales of consumables, partially offset by sales declines in the apparel, seasonal and home categories. The Company believes that the effect of unseasonably cold and damp weather on certain product categories negatively impacted same-store sales in the quarter.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 30.5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 17 basis points. The first quarter of 2018 gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups on inventory purchases and an improved rate of inventory shrink. These factors were partially offset by a greater proportion of sales coming from consumables that generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, and increased transportation costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) as a percentage of net sales were 22.4% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 21.8% in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 60 basis points. The first quarter of 2018 SG&A increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, due in part to the investment in store manager compensation, and increases in occupancy costs, utilities, and property taxes on leased stores, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.\nThe effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 21.6% compared to 37.2% in the first quarter of 2017. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was lower than the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the federal tax law changes contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), including the change in the federal income tax rate to 21% in the 2018 period compared to 35% in the 2017 period.\nThe Company reported net income of $365 million, or diluted EPS of $1.36, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $279 million, or diluted EPS of $1.02, in the first quarter of 2017, an increase in diluted EPS of 33.3%.\nMerchandise Inventories\nAs of May 4, 2018, total merchandise inventories, at cost, were $3.59 billion compared to $3.30 billion as of May 5, 2017, an increase of approximately 0.4% on a per store basis.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal additions to property and equipment in the first quarter of 2018 were $165 million, including approximately: $70 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $41 million for new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; $39 million for distribution and transportation related projects; and $12 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company opened 241 new stores, remodeled 322 stores and relocated 31 stores.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company repurchased $150 million of its common stock, or 1.6 million shares, under its share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2018, at an average price of $94.41 per share. From the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011 through the end of the first quarter of 2018, the Company has repurchased 83.0 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $63.80 per share, for a total cost of $5.3 billion. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Under the authorization, purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other conditions. The authorization has no expiration date.\nDividend\nOn May 29, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share on the Company’s common stock, payable on or before July 24, 2018 to shareholders of record on July 10, 2018. While the Board of Directors intends to continue regular cash dividends, the declaration and amount of future dividends are subject to the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon, among other things, the Company’s results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors the Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion.\nReiterating Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance and Store Growth Outlook\nFor the 52-week fiscal year ending February 1, 2019 (“fiscal year 2018”), the Company is reiterating its financial guidance and store growth outlook issued on March 15, 2018.\nThe Company expects net sales to increase approximately 9%, with same-store sales growth estimated to be in the mid-two percent range. The Company expects the fiscal year 2018 operating margin rate to be relatively unchanged as compared to the fiscal year 2017 operating margin rate.\nThe Company expects fiscal year 2018 diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. This diluted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of 22% to 23%.\nThe Company currently anticipates a cash benefit of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2018 as a result of the TCJA.\nShare repurchases for fiscal year 2018 are expected to be approximately $850 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 are expected to be in the range of $725 million to $800 million.\nThe Company plans to open approximately 900 new stores, remodel 1,000 stores and relocate 100 stores in fiscal year 2018.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 31, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. CT/10:00 a.m. ET, hosted by Todd Vasos, chief executive officer, and John Garratt, chief financial officer.
