REUTERS/Stephane Mahe Asked why the cold war made a good backdrop for a romance drama, Pawlikowski said: “There were a lot of obstacles around at the time, and love is, to a large degree, a matter of overcoming obstacles.”\nThe movie is also inspired by personal experience.\nPawlikowski, 60, lived in exile from Poland from the age of 14 when his ballerina mother escaped with him to the West. The protagonists of “Cold War” are named after his late parents.\nSlideshow (8 Images) “There are a lot of things in common between this couple and my parents,” he said.\n“They were kind of a disastrous couple who fell in love, separated, fell in love again, married other people, got together again, changed countries, fell apart, came together again and so on.\n“It’s not their portrait but there are quite similar mechanics to their relationship.”\nCritics praised the film’s black and white cinematography, musical score and sense of humor, with IndieWire comparing Joanna Kulig’s performance as Zula to a young Jeanne Moreau: “an alcoholic hellcat who thrusts herself into the embraces of other men – quite literally, in a reckless spree around the dance-floor of a rock’n’roll club.\n“It’s a terrific, high-showmanship sequence, as if Pawlikowski had the urge to unleash his inner Scorsese.”\nThe Cannes Film Festival runs from May 8 to May 19.\nReporting by Robin Pomeroy; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:24:59.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
