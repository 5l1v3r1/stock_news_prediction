It has been a great ride with many wonderful people. At the same time, there are other adventures that I’d like to pursue in my personal interests and in business,” Revington said.\n“George’s strategic vision, and his ability to develop ground-breaking strategies and successfully implement them, is as good as I have ever experienced,” said Paul Toms, chairman and chief executive officer of Hooker Furniture. “We appreciate his contributions and service, and have enjoyed working with him for the past two-and-a-half years.”\n“I want to thank all of the smart, determined people who built HMI from humble beginnings in Phoenix, Arizona, and who lived the HMI culture,” Revington said. “I also thank the trusted partners in Asia for their incredible hard work and willingness to adapt. And I thank our retail partners, whose openness created truly collaborative relationships that are the basis for sustainable competitive advantage for both parties.\n“Hooker Furniture and HMI have the strategies and people in place to continue to grow, and are extremely well-positioned to be a major force in the industry. I wish everyone the very best.”\nSeparately, HFC is announcing appointments in the HMI President’s role.\nIncorporated in 1924, Hooker Furniture is one of the most respected furniture brands in the world.
