Management will discuss the Company's results summarized below on a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 10:00 a.m.(Eastern Time).\nSummary results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nTotal investment income: $2.3 million, or $0.11 per share\nNet investment loss: $(0.1) million, or $(0.01) per share\nNet realized and unrealized gains: $1.8 million, or $0.09 per share\nNet asset value: $49.1 million, or $2.43 per share\nNew portfolio investments added during the quarter: $10.9 million (par value)\nFair value of portfolio investments: $65.0 million\nPortfolio Activity\nThe fair value of our investment portfolio was $65.0 million at March 31, 2018, increasing 0.2% compared to December 31, 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company added investments in six new portfolio companies, investing $10.8 million, and had realizations totaling $13.6 million. During the quarter, our energy exposure in our investment portfolio was reduced to 0% as of the result of the redemption of our $11.5 million investment in the Talos senior unsecured notes at par in February. The current weighted average yield of our portfolio based on the cost and fair value of our yielding investments was 13.6% and 14.1%, respectively, as of March 31, 2018.\nIn January 2018, we purchased $0.7 million of second lien term loan in Safe Fleet, a provider of safety products for fleet vehicles worldwide. The Safe Fleet second lien term loan was purchased at a 0.50% discount to par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+6.75% with a 1% floor, and matures in February 2026.\nAlso in January 2018, we purchased $0.5 million of second lien term loan in MedRisk LLC., or MedRisk, a leading provider of managed care services for the workers' compensation industry and related market sectors. The MedRisk second lien term loan was purchased at a 0.50% discount to par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+6.75%, and matures in December 2025.\nIn February 2018, our remaining position in Talos of $11.5 million was redeemed at par. This legacy energy investment was initiated in February 2013, generated a gross unlevered internal rate of return of 9.95%, and a return on investment of 1.30x.\nAlso in February 2018, we added $5.0 million of second lien term loan in CVS Holdings, I, LP., or MyEyeDr., a provider of vision care services, prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses, and contact lenses. The MyEyeDr. second lien term loan was purchased at a 0.50% discount to par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+6.75% with a 1% floor, and matures in February 2026.\nAlso in February 2018, we purchased $0.3 million of second lien term loan in EaglePicher Technologies LLC., or EaglePicher, a leading provider of mission-critical power solutions for high-value applications within the defense, aerospace, and medical end-markets. The EaglePicher second lien term loan was purchased at a 0.75% discount to par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+7.25%, and matures in March 2026.\nIn March 2018, we purchased $1.25 million of second lien term loan in AlliedUniversal HoldCo LLC., or AlliedUniversal, a provider of contract security services in the United States. The AlliedUniversal second lien term loan was purchased at par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+8.50% with a 1% floor and matures in July 2023.\nAlso in March 2018, we purchased $1.6 million of first lien last out revolver and $0.5 million of first lien last out term loan to CC Dental Implants Intermediate, or ClearChoice, a provider of full-mouth dental restoration and dental implant services throughout the United States. The ClearChoice first lien last out revolver and term loan were purchased at a 1% discount to par, earn interest of LIBOR+6.50% with 1% floor, and mature in January 2023. At March 31, 2018, the funded portion balance of the ClearChoice revolver was $0.6 million. Both the first lien last out revolver and term loan are entitled to skim interest on the first lien first out term loan which will initially increase the interest rate spread by approximately 28 basis points.\nOperating Results\nInvestment income totaled $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, decreasing 7.0% compared to $2.5 million in the corresponding quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investment income due to a lower average portfolio balance partially offset by a higher weighted average yield on our investments 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.4 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 5.1%, compared to operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017. Interest expense and bank fees decreased by 15.5% to $0.8 million from $1.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to lower principal balance due to a partial repayment in December 2017. Management fees decreased by 29.8% to $0.4 million from $0.6 million due to lower base management fees as a result of lower average asset base subject to the base management fee. Professional fees increased by 137.3% to $0.6 million from $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in legal fees. Other general and administrative expenses decreased by 3.1% to $0.4 million from $0.4 million primarily due to a decrease in employee related expenses compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe resulting net investment loss was $(0.1) million or $(0.01) per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net investment income was driven by lower investment income and an increase in legal fees.\nWe recorded net realized and unrealized gain on investments totaling $1.8 million or $0.09 per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $19.3 million loss, or $(0.96) per share, for the first quarter of 2017. A significant portion of the loss recognized in the first quarter of 2017 was the $21.2 million write-down in Castex, a legacy energy portfolio investment.\nOverall, we experienced a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $1.7 million, or $0.08 per share, for the first quarter of 2018. After declaring a quarterly dividend during the period of $0.02 per share, our net asset value increased 2.5% from $2.37 per share as of December 31, 2017 to $2.43 per share as of March 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $22.2 million. The total amount outstanding under our credit facility at March 31, 2018 was $36.0 million with $0.0 million available to draw.\nOn February 2, 2018, we exercised the option to extend the Credit Facility to September 9, 2018, as permitted in our existing Credit Agreement.\nOn May 7, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.02 per share, payable on July 9, 2018 to holders of record as of June 30, 2018.\nAdditional Disclosure\nInvestments are considered to be fully realized when the original investment at the security level has been fully exited. Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from the investments. Our IRR calculations are unaudited. Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing. Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to an investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, administrative fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions. Gross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of management fees, expenses, incentive fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\nWebcast / Conference Call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 15, 2018\nWe invite all interested persons to participate in our conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).
