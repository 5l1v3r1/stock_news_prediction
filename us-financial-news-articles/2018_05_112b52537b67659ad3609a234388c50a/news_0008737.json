Nearly 430,000 people, including opposition politicians, have fled the East African nation of 10.5 million people since President Pierre Nkurunziza won a third term in a 2015 election that led to violent clashes.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert, Susan Heavey and Makini Brice; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T16:11:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
