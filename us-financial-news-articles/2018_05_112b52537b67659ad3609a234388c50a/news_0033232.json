North Korea will not accept CVID that does not ensure the security of the regime,” Mr. Thae said.\nPresident Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un both say they want denuclearization, but they may have different definitions of the word.

Last year, he told reporters in Seoul that Mr. Kim’s “days are numbered” and vowed to help bring him down.\nHis remarks come at a delicate time. Mr. Kim met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month at the inter-Korean demilitarized zone and is set to meet with Mr. Trump in Singapore on June 12.\nMr. Trump said last week that he believed Mr. Kim wanted to strike a big deal to give up his nuclear program in exchange for economic inducements.\n“I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world. I really believe that,” he said.\nMr. Thae, speaking to reporters at the release of a 542-page memoir, said North Korea had described its nuclear program as its “spear and shield” just a week before last month’s inter-Korean summit—language that underscored Mr. Kim’s commitment to holding on to such a strategic asset.\n‘ What Kim Jong Un means by a security guarantee is a promise to keep his hereditary political system intact, and his absolute authority intact. ’\n—Thae Yong Ho Instead, Mr. Thae said, the North Korean leader is more likely to seek increased South Korean investment in his country by initially reopening it to South Korean tourists. He reasoned that Mr. Kim’s youth in Switzerland had made him open to the idea of earning cash through tourism, unlike his father, Kim Jong Il.\nThe former Pyongyang diplomat further asserted tourism would be a way to earn trust with South Korean investors, who remain wary of spending cash in North Korea due to the political risk stemming from the regime’s nuclear-weapons program.\nMr. Kim is likely to pursue tourism ventures for two to three years in coastal areas, before seeking to widen South Korean investment to joint industrial parks similar to one at Kaesong that was built with South Korean cash and employed cheap North Korean labor. That park was closed in 2016 after North Korea’s fourth nuclear test.\nWrite to Andrew Jeong at andrew.jeong@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:31:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
