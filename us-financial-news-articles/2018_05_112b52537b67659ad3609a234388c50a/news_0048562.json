Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the timing and completion of the Placement, and the availability of regulatory approvals for the Placement. Except for statements of historical fact relating to the Company, certain information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as “plan,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “believe,” “anticipate”, “estimate” and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made and are based on several assumptions and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of the Company and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.\nFactors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such forward-looking statements include the inability to obtain regulatory approvals required in relation to the Placement. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Investors and others who rely on forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. The Company believes that the expectations reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this press release should not be unduly relied upon. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s estimates or opinions should change except as required by applicable securities laws.\nAlthough the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. Statements concerning mineral reserve and resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements to the extent they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if the property is developed.\nStatements about the Company's future expectations and all other statements in this press release other than historical facts are \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as that term defined in the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbours created thereby. Since these statements involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change at any time, the Company's actual results may differ materially from the expected results.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nMark Fedikow\nPresident\nNorth American Nickel Inc.\nFor more information contact:\nNorth American Nickel Inc.\nJaclyn Ruptash\nCorporate Communications\n604-770-4334\nToll free: 1-866-816-0118\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource: North American Nickel Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/228d6861-9e89-4277-87d8-248bda7f5a3c"], "published": "2018-05-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:29:01.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
