Tom Garrett (R., Va.) said Monday he was struggling with alcoholism and wouldn’t run for re-election this fall.\n“There’s one area where I haven’t been honest,” Mr. Garrett, a first-term member of Congress, said in an emotional video statement Monday announcing his decision to retire. “Any person, Republican, Democrat or independent, who’s known me for any period of time and has any integrity, knows two things: I am a good man and I am an alcoholic,” he said.\nThe announcement ended a period of speculation surrounding the political fate of Mr. Garrett, 46 years old and a member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the House’s most conservative Republicans.\nThe lawmaker had said last week in a Facebook livestream that he planned to run again in November, rejecting reports he was expected to retire.\nMr. Garrett faced a competitive race for re-election in November against Democratic nominee Leslie Cockburn, a former journalist and the mother of actress Olivia Wilde. Ms. Cockburn had significantly outraised Mr. Garrett in a district that President Donald Trump won in 2016 with 53% of the vote.\n“This must be a very difficult time for him, his family and staff,” Ms. Cockburn said on Twitter Monday. “It is important that he has recognized his alcohol addiction and I wish him well.”\nThe Republican Party of Virginia said on Twitter Monday that the Fifth District Committee would immediately begin the process of choosing a replacement nominee.\nBefore being elected to the House, Mr. Garrett served in the Virginia state senate and in the U.S. Army.\nMr. Garrett disputed a Politico report saying he and his wife had asked his employees to run errands for them, including caring for their dog and driving his daughters to and from his district west of Richmond, Va.\n“The recent attacks on my family and myself are a series of half truths and whole lies,” Mr. Garrett said in his statement. “They’re driven more by Republicans than Democrats.”\nWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:43:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
