Operating cash flow (net income for the period adjusted for items not involving cash) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $84,000 compares to operating cash flow of $85,000 for the same three-month period of 2017.\nWhile parts and service sales to the Company’s traditional food and beverage customers increased during the period, overall parts and service revenues decreased compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
