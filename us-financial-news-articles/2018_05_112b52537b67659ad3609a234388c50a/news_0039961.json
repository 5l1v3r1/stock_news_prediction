It said that first quarter EBITDA of its U.S. division totalled $26 million, up from $9 million a year ago but down from $39 million in the last quarter of 2017 due to an increase in raw materials prices and lower sales prices.\nIt said its European division expects stronger financial results in 2018 due to higher demand and a more favourable product mix, but did not elaborate.
