Cole (1-0) fanned four in two scoreless innings after starting his outing with two walks. It also occurred after left fielder Brett Gardner and catcher Sanchez teamed up to complete an inning-ending double play in the ninth in a play the Yankees successfully challenged.\nBefore the Yankees won for the 18th time in 21 games, Sanchez and Hicks hit back-to-back solo homers off Andrew Triggs in the second inning and Judge hit a two-run drive in the sixth off Triggs.
