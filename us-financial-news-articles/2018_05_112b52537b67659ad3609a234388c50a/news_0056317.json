Instead, he claimed that “they [Mueller’s team] are giving us the material to do it.”\n“Of course, we have to do it in defending the president. We are defending, to a large extent, remember, Dana, we are defending here, it is for public opinion, because eventually the decision here is going to be impeach or not impeach.”\n“Members of Congress, Democrat and Republican, are going to be informed a lot by their constituents,” Giuliani continued. “So, our jury is the American—as it should be—is the American people.”\nDue to the possibility of FBI infiltration and other revelations, Giuliani therefore claimed that Mueller’s investigation is no longer legitimate . But he didn’t take a Trump/Mueller interview off the table.", "external_links": ["https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/27/politics/rudy-giuliani-sotu/index.html"], "published": "2018-05-28T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T14:37:14.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
