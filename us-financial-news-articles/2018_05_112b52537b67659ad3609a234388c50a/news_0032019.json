Growth in 2017 was 6.81 percent.\nVietnam will “remain among the fastest-growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region, and fastest among ‘BB’ rated peers,” Fitch said.\nIt also said Vietnam’s foreign exchange reserves are expected to reach $66 billion by the end-2018, providing a cushion against external shocks.\nForeign exchange reserves rose to $49 billion at the end of 2017 from $37 billion one year earlier, backed by large capital inflows and a current account surplus, Fitch said.\nTuesday’s upgrade “is very positive as it shows macroeconomic stability is further improving,” said Can Van Luc, an economist with the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam.\nLuc said the upgrade will lift foreign investment inflows and that Vietnam will be able to have access to lower-cost funds.\n“The country needs cheaper loans from international lenders to support its growth,” he said. PRIVATISATION DRIVE\nThe government said last month Vietnam plans to borrow 108.03 trillion dong ($4.74 billion) from foreign sources this year.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) inflows remained strong in 2017, with the manufacturing sector seeing a 40 percent increase from the previous year to $21.3 billion, Fitch said.\nVietnam’s public debt has been well contained, Fitch said, falling to 61.4 percent of GDP at the end of last year from 63.6 percent at end-2016, supported by inflows from privatisation proceeds.\nIn recent years, the Vietnamese government has stepped up efforts to divest state-owned enterprises, through initial public offerings and stake sales.\nThe government in December raised $4.48 billion from selling a controlling 53.59-percent stake in the country’s largest brewer, Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp, to Thai Beverage PCL.\nThis month, the State Bank of Vietnam said non-performing loans in the banking system had been reduced to below 3 percent of outstanding loans.\nBut Fitch said it believed non-performing loans remain under-reported and true asset quality is likely to be weaker than stated.
