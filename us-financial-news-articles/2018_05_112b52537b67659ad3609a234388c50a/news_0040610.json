Both passengers and drivers now will have the option of pursuing their claims in open courtrooms and to share their experiences.\nLyft announced its new stance Tuesday, a few hours after Uber announced the same shift as part of its efforts to turn over a new leaf after a wave of revelations and allegations about its bad behavior.\nIn a statement, Lyft applauded Uber for its \"good decision.\"\n3 a.m.\nUber's ride-hailing service will give its U.S. passengers and drivers more leeway to pursue claims of sexual misconduct, its latest attempt to reverse its reputation for brushing aside bad behavior.\nThe shift announced Tuesday will allow riders and drivers to file allegations of rape and other sexual misconduct in courts and mediation instead of being locked into an arbitration hearing.\nThe San Francisco company is also scrapping a policy requiring all settlements of sexual misconduct to be kept confidential.\nThe new rules mark another conciliatory move made by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi (kahs-row-SHAH'-hee).
