But they were not part of the study, which was outlined in a research letter.\n“We were more concerned about hearts and lungs because they’re the most vulnerable organs if deprived of oxygen for a period of time,” he said.\nA similar trend has not been seen in Europe, according to Mehra, who is medical director of Brigham and Women’s Heart and Vascular Center.\n“That’s the most interesting finding in this. The trend in Europe is absolutely flat,” he said, because “in Europe, the laws protect against opioid prescriptions, so the rate of medical prescriptions for opioid drugs in Europe is really low.”\nA few years ago, he added, “there were approximately 52,000 deaths per year in the United States from drug abuse and in Europe there were only about 7,000.” That makes the U.S. rate much higher, even adjusting for population size, he noted.\n“And when you look at the type of drug abuse in Europe, 81 percent of all the deaths that occur are from heroin, while opioid and prescription drug deaths are almost nothing,” Mehra said. “Here it’s the opposite.”\nThe research team is continuing to analyze this phenomenon, now “going regionally and state-by-state to see what the effect of this is in the U.S.,” Mehra said. “We’re even looking at states with different political leanings and seeing what effect that has on transplantation rates.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2rFKC0p The New England Journal of Medicine, online May 16, 2018.", "external_links": ["https://bit.ly/2rFKC0p"], "published": "2018-05-17T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:04:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
