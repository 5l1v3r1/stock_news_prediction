REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 1.4 percent to 1.058 billion Swiss francs ($1.06 billion) versus the 1.050 billion forecast by analysts polled by Reuters.\nShareholders’ net profit rose 2.1 percent to 381 million francs.\nRevenue increased by 1.9 percent to 2.885 billion francs versus the 2.829 billion forecast by analysts, the government-controlled company said.\n“The demands of our customers are growing, as is the volume of data on the networks. Consequently, the need for investment remains high,” CEO Schaeppi said.\n“At the same time, prices are falling and promotions are intensifying the competition.”\nSwisscom has reduced its staff by 4.4 percent in the last year and reduced spending on property, facilities and equipment.\nIn February it increased its cost-cutting target to fight competition from more agile rivals.\nIt aims to keep capital expenditure below 2.4 billion this year and reduce costs in Switzerland by 100 million francs a year through 2020, in part by eliminating 700 jobs.\nThe company kept it guidance for 2018 EBITDA of around 4.2 billion on revenue of around 11.6 billion.\nIt proposed an unchanged dividend of 22 francs per share, the level it also targets for next year should it hit its goals.\n($1 = 0.9955 Swiss francs)\nFILE PHOTO: CEO Urs Schaeppi of Swiss telecom company Swisscom speaks to media during their annual news conference in Zurich, Switzerland February 4, 2016.
