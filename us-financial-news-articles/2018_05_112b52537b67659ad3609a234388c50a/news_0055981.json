Industry bellwether Zhangzhou Pientzehuang Pharmaceutical plunged the maximum allowed 10 percent, after having gained more than 80 percent so far this year. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.58 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 0.55 percent. ** At 07:02 GMT, the yuan was Quote: d at 6.4151 per U.S. dollar, 0.28 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.3969. ** The largest percentage gainers on the main Shanghai Composite index were Henan Taloph Pharmaceutical Stock Co Ltd up 10.1 percent, followed by Jiangsu Lianhuan Pharmaceutical Co Ltd gaining 10.06 percent and CCS Supply Chain Management Co Ltd up by 10.05 percent. ** The largest percentage losers on the Shanghai index were Hubei Mailyard Share Co Ltd down 10.03 percent, followed by GuangDong GenSho Logistics Co Ltd losing 10.01 percent and Shanghai Wondertek Software Co Ltd down by 10.01 percent. ** So far this year, the Shanghai stock index is down 5.6 percent, the CSI300 also has fallen 5.6 percent while China’s H-share index listed in Hong Kong is up 2.1 percent. Shanghai stocks have risen 1.24 percent this month. ** As of 07:03 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 20.54 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
