REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\nIn the first conviction in a series of lawsuits against Ma since he left office in 2016, Taiwan’s High Court overturned a lower court’s judgment of not guilty.\n“Ma Ying-jeou violated the Communication and Surveillance Act,” it said in its judgment, adding that the punishment for the sections infringed was four months’ imprisonment.\nThe court found that Ma had leaked information related to national security, and an opposition lawmaker Ker Chien-ming, that should have been confidential.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\nMa’s sentence could, however, be avoided on payment of a fine of T$120,000 ($4,019), the court said in a statement, in line with Taiwan law that allows such payments for lighter sentences, instead of going to jail.\nMa told Taiwan media he planned to appeal.
