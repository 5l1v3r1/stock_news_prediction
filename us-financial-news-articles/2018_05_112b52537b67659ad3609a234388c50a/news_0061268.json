They have developed two leading B2B sales and growth offerings, SalesAmp and SalesXsell, that use proven outbound marketing approaches combined with inside sales support to drive sales for individual salespeople.\n“Over the past 21 years, I have focused on getting marketing and sales departments aligned to make marketing work for sales. Joining with Figmints is the exciting next step for that mission. Bringing developers, designers, and digital marketing to our SalesAmp process will allow us to scale and support marketing and sales teams with even greater results,” said April Williams, President and Visionary of North Star.\nSince 1999, Figmints has become known as one of the premier brand and digital agencies in New England, with an exceptional talent to awaken company’s stories that needed to be told. As HubSpot’s ambassador partner in RI, they have differentiated themselves from the crowd through innovative online strategies with streamlined, consistent creative execution of digital marketing, web design and development, branding, and video.\n“We get really excited when we get to help companies and organizations tell stories worth sharing,” said James Kwon, CEO of Figmints. “We craft these stories visually through branding, establishing them on the web, and driving the right audience to listen carefully. The biggest impact is when we connect these stories in a way that it improves the bottom line, and shows how a predictable funnel can change the way a business views marketing. It’s been incredible to watch what God is doing in our companies, and having April and her team with us is an exciting next step towards how we get to serve our clients together.”\nBoth companies will be located at the current Figmints address:\nLocation: 163 Exchange St, #101, Pawtucket, RI 02860\nWebsites: www.figmints.com and www.fortheloveofmarketing.com\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005858/en/\nFigmints/North Star\nApril Williams, 401-484-1344\nSource: Figmints and North Star", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.figmints.com&esheet=51813878&newsitemid=20180530005858&lan=en-US&anchor=www.figmints.com&index=1&md5=fdb9b24a6609e2062132a43bd85ec4a8", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fortheloveofmarketing.com&esheet=51813878&newsitemid=20180530005858&lan=en-US&anchor=www.fortheloveofmarketing.com&index=2&md5=a3a023c8a467e6e852f1a68b6ff13073", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005858/en/"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T19:39:05.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
