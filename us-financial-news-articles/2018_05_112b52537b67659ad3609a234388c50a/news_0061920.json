Its only cargo plane on order is a 777 Freighter.\nIt was not immediately clear how many aircraft deliveries Etihad was seeking to finance via the debt it is looking to raise in the current round of talks with lenders.\nOne or two Abu Dhabi-based banks placed tight bids for the proposed financing and are likely to either provide it on a bilateral basis or through club loans, the sources said.\nEarlier this month, sources told Reuters Etihad could cancel some aircraft on order as part of a company-wide strategy review that has been underway since 2016 when it lost nearly $2 billion.\nEtihad is considering its options for more than 160 aircraft it has ordered, ranging from swapping modes to delaying deliveries to outright cancellations, said the sources in the May 6 reporter.\nThe requests for proposals to finance 787 deliveries could suggest the airline is sticking with the Dreamliner which it has operated since 2015.\nEtihad also has 88 Airbus jets on order, including 62 A350s that are yet to enter the fleet.
