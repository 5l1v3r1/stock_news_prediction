The spokesman told Reuters that normal operations were restored on Wednesday. I\nKGHM took control of Sierra Gorda in 2011 when it bought the Canadian company Quadra FNX for $2.1 billion. The remaining 45 percent of the deposit belongs to Japan’s Sumitomo.\nSierra Gorda produced 101,700 tonnes of Chile’s 5.5 million-tonne total copper output last year.
