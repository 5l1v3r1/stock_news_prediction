It collected an additional $176 million in overseas markets.\n“Deadpool 2” couldn’t match the original “Deadpool,” which broke records and shattered expectations when it took in $132 million in its opening weekend two years ago. But the movie’s relatively inexpensive budget and strong reaction from fans still give its studio, 21st Century Fox’s FOX, -0.03% Twentieth Century Fox, a hit.\n“Deadpool 2” begins an unusually busy summer movie season, with Disney’s “Solo: A Star Wars Story” coming next week and major releases like “Jurassic World” following soon behind. Industry analysts expect the summer box office to rise about 20% compared with last year’s disappointing showing. Another superhero sequel, Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, -0.39% “Avengers: Infinity War,” followed in second place. It added $28.7 million to its blockbuster haul of $595 million. “Infinity War” has grossed $1.8 billion world-wide so far.
