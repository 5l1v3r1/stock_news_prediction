The distribution primarily represents oil production during the month of February 2018 and natural gas production during January 2018.\nThe following table displays underlying oil and natural gas sales volumes and average received wellhead prices attributable to the current and prior month net profits interest calculations.\nUnderlying Sales Volumes Average Price Oil Natural Gas Oil Natural Gas Bbls Bbls/D Mcf Mcf/D (per Bbl) (per Mcf) Current Month 52,534 1,876 359,703 11,603 $ 60.77 $ 2.92 Prior Month 59,699 1,926 397,208\n12,813 $ 60.77 $ 2.87 Oil cash receipts for the properties underlying the Trust totaled $3.2 million for the current month, a decrease of $0.4 million from the prior month distribution period as a result of a reduction in sales volumes compared to the prior month. The reduction in sales volumes was primarily attributable to three fewer days of production in February compared to January.\nNatural gas cash receipts decreased slightly from $1.1 million in the prior distribution period to $1.0 million in the current month due to a decrease in natural gas volumes, driven by payment timing differences, partially offset by an increase in the realized natural gas price.\nTotal direct operating expenses, including lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, and gathering and transportation expenses, were $2.6 million, an increase of $0.3 million from the prior month. The increase in direct operating expenses is primarily due to lower than normal lease operating expenses in the prior distribution period. Capital expenditures were $0.1 million in the current month.\nAlso included in the current month distribution is a reduction of approximately $53,000 from the net profits attributable to the underlying properties due to the inclusion in prior period distribution calculations of certain expenses and revenue that related to properties sold as part of the divestitures completed in September 2017. As a result of the sale of these properties, the net amounts previously paid to the Trust have been adjusted in the current distribution period.\nBankruptcy of Enduro Resource Partners\nEnduro Resource Partners, the sponsor of the Trust, has informed The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”) of the Trust, that on May 15, 2018 Enduro Resource Partners and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for a court-supervised proceeding under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Court”). Enduro Resource Partners has also informed the Trustee that it has entered into a stalking horse purchase agreement with Evolution Petroleum Corporation (“Evolution”) relating to the sale of the properties in which the Trust holds a net profits interest and all of the outstanding trust units owned by Enduro Resource Partners. The stalking horse purchase agreement and sale contemplated by the purchase agreement are subject to higher and better bids and Court approval. The Trust has not filed a Chapter 11 petition and expects to continue in the normal course without disruption to the unitholders.\nAbout Enduro Royalty Trust\nEnduro Royalty Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed by Enduro Resource Partners to own a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain of Enduro Resource Partners’ properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the amount of the periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, and the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis.
