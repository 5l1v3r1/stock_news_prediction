Hall’s method entailed applying a strong electrical current to aluminum oxide, or alumina, the raw material required for producing aluminum. But this method involves burning carbon, and therefore producing carbon dioxide.\nApple said the new process was discovered by three of its engineers, Brian Lynch, Jim Yurko and Katie Sassaman, at Alcoa. Apple, Alcao and Rio Tinto hope to launch the patent-pending technology for commercial release by 2024.\nApple has been ramping up its efforts towards sustainability recently. Last month, the firm claimed that its global facilities were now powered entirely by renewable energy . It also has a recycling robot called Daisy that disassembles iPhones to recover valuable materials.
