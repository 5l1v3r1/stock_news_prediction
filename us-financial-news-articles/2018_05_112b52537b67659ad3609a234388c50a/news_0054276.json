The proceeds were transferred to dozens of jurisdictions and thousands of companies for various goods and services,” the FIU said in its annual report.\nIn that year, Estonia’s economy was worth just 17.9 billion euros.\nThe Estonian police also warned more attempts to launder funds via could be expected as more bank closures are expected in Russia in 2018.\nLatvian authorities warned on Thursday that an increased flow of questionable and illegally sourced money into other EU states was expected as Baltic authorities crack down on non-residents accounts.
