Putting the trade war on hold creates a much more positive backdrop for everything.\"\nWATCH: Cramer unpacks the trade-related rally show chapters Cramer: This trade-led rally makes sense—just look at the retail sector 20 Hours Ago | 12:18 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
