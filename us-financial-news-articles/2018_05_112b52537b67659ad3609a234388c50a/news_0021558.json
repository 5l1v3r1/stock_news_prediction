Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nHowever, Stovall doesn't share that sentiment in his note: \"A Peak Is No Reason To Panic.\"\n\"EPS [earnings per share] growth for Q1 2018 is nearly 600 basis points higher than end-of-quarter estimates, but history implies that a peak in EPS growth does not translate to panic that this bull will soon come to a screeching halt,\" Stovall wrote. \"Indeed in more than 70% of observations since WWII, the S&P 500 rose in price nine months after a peak in 12-month GAAP EPS growth.\"\nDespite a maturing bull market, Stovall contends the odds are against a pivot into bear territory even if another deep sell-off wipes out more value.\n\"Essentially, what we're saying is stay the course. This correction might not be over quite yet, but we don't see it morphing into a new bear market,\" he said.\nStovall's forecast calls for the S&P 500 to end 2018 at 2,900, an 8 percent rise from current levels. He expects most of the year's gains to happen later in the year, citing uncertainty related to the November midterm elections.\n\"I call myself a bull with a lower case 'b,'\" Stovall said.
