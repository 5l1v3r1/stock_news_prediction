So it appears that trade is holding up for now,” he added.\nFor more details, see (Reporting by Tom Daly and Muyu Xu; additional reporting by Melanie Burton in MELBOURNE; editing by Richard Pullin)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:45:58.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
