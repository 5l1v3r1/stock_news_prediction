Tyson, Avara's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"It comes with a world-class development center and a dedicated team of experts that will support us in delivering high-quality pharmaceuticals that meet or exceed customer expectations and regulatory requirements.\"\nThe proposed acquisition of Novartis Technical Operations' sterile manufacturing facility and the adjacent Sandoz Development Center located on the Sandoz Canada campus in Boucherville, Quebec, is expected to be finalized in the next few months, following the completion of a number of closing conditions including receipt of anti-trust approvals. It follows Avara's acquisition of another sterile facility in the past year, one from Pfizer Inc. in Liscate, Italy, and one solid dose manufacturing facility from GlaxoSmithKline in Aiken, South Carolina. It will bring the number of manufacturing and development sites operated by Avara worldwide to ten: two in Canada; three in the United States, including corporate headquarters; one in Puerto Rico; one in the UK; one in Ireland; one in Italy; and one in France.\nThe Boucherville site is the biggest injectables production facility in Canada and provides a number of strategic and lifesaving medicines to the Canadian healthcare system, mostly hospitals. As part of the asset purchase agreement, the parties have committed to sign a long-term supply contract to guarantee continuous supply of products manufactured in Boucherville. No impact on jobs is anticipated at the moment and Avara intends to invest in the site and pursue business development opportunities to optimize the plant's utilization and expand its customer base.\n\"We look forward to a seamless transition for employees, patients, customers, partners and other stakeholders,\" added Mr. Tyson. \"We are impressed by the know-how at the Boucherville plant and Sandoz Development Center team and intend to leverage their expertise to develop new opportunities in the contract pharmaceutical market, in Canada and elsewhere.\"\nAbout Avara\nAvara Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., based in Norwalk, Connecticut is an international pharmaceutical services company that delivers world-class contract manufacturing and technical services to the pharmaceutical industry.
