Its goal is to encourage investments in these companies by removing the barrier of lacking understanding in the market.\nIn order to maintain professional, independent and unbiased analysis, the companies signed an agreement with the TASE to receive the analysis services for an obligatory period of two years. The companies cannot withdraw from the project during this period. The analysis is funded by the companies surveyed with funding from the Chief Scientist and the TASE.\nSummary of Highlights\nSafe-T released its annual report on 25 March, 2018 detailing the following:\nThe company developed and is now promoting, in partnership with its distributors, a dedicated certification program.\nThe company believes that further measures taken during 2017, such as replacing distributors, recruiting a team in the US, appointing a CMO and so on, have laid strong foundations that will soon materialize into more contracts and increased revenues.\nGoing forward, Safe-T's growth strategy comprises;\nMonetization on its extensive distribution and partner network Boosting marketing and sales activities, focusing on enhancing their brand and reputation Continued investment in R&D, improving existing products and developing new ones\nSafe-T's patented technology is recognized by experts and has been the recipient of prestigious awards such as the Fortress Cyber Security Award for Compliance and Authentication & Identity (April 2018) and a 2018 InfoSec Award (March 2018).\nWe view the company as an attractive one, but believe that it entails the typical risks for a small-cap company in the rapidly growing cybersecurity space.\nMajor clients in each of the company's target industrial verticals, indicate market confidence. If the company successfully penetrates the North American and European markets, it may be acquired in the coming years, as the consolidation trend surges.\nWe maintain Safe-T's equity value at $53M / NIS 188M corresponding to a target price ranging between NIS 8.91 and NIS 9.88; a mean of NIS 9.38.\nNet Revenues (Gross Profit) in 2017 increased to $513K from $331K in 2016, an increase of 55%.
