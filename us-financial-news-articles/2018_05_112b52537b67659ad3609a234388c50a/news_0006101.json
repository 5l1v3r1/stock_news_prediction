Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion in cash and stock.\nWhatsApp, a pun on the phrase \"What's up?,\" grew in popularity in part because its messages are stored on users' smartphones and not on the company's servers, making the service more private and difficult to hack.\nConcerns about Facebook's handling of personal information have grown since the social network's admission in March that the data of millions of users was wrongly harvested by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\nFacebook has taken steps in recent months to generate revenue from WhatsApp, which unlike Facebook's flagship social network does not have advertising. Koum and Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg ruled out advertising on WhatsApp. (Reporting by Anirban Paul and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and David Ingram in San Francisco; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T01:41:00.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
