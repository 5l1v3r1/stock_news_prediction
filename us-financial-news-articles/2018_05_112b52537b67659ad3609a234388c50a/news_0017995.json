In a statement, the police appealed for calm and said that for now the situation was under control.\nNajib’s United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party postponed an evening news conference and said Najib, who has ruled the country for nearly 10 years, would address the media at 9:45 a.m. (0145 GMT) on Thursday.\nMalaysia’s currency weakened in offshore trading on the election result, with the ringgit one-month non-deliverable forward falling 2.4 percent to 4.07 against the dollar.

REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin “HISTORY IN THE MAKING”\nThe reverse for UMNO, the dominant partner in BN, takes Malaysia into uncharted political terrain, said Keith Leong, head of research at the KRA Group consultancy. “We are witnessing history being made in this country,” he said.\nEthnic-Malay Muslims have long tended to support BN for affirmative-action policies that give them government contracts, cheap housing and guaranteed university admissions.\nMahathir’s alliance, which counts on urban votes and support from the minority ethnic-Chinese and Indian communities, had hoped the veteran Malay leader would win over voters usually loyal to BN. That strategy appeared to have paid off.\n“There has been a significant shift in the Malay vote,” said Rashaad Ali, an analyst with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\nMahathir is a polarising figure and many voters are suspicious of him because of his iron-fist rule as prime minister from 1981 to 2003.\nBut 64-year-old Najib’s popularity dropped sharply over the past three years, partly due to a scandal over 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund from which billions of dollars were allegedly siphoned off.\nMahathir was once Najib’s mentor, but he left UMNO over the 1MDB affair and joined the opposition. Najib, who was chairman of 1MDB’s advisory board, has denied any wrongdoing and he has been cleared of any offence by Malaysia’s attorney general.\nIn an even more unlikely change of heart, Mahathir last year buried a feud with Anwar, 70, and the two agreed to join forces to topple Najib.

Anwar then started a movement known as ‘Reformasi’ - reform - to end UMNO’s race- and patronage-based governance, but he was stopped in his tracks by charges of sodomy and graft, which he denied, but for which he was jailed.\nAnwar was imprisoned again in 2015, when Najib was prime minister, after another sodomy charge, which he described as a politically motivated attempt to end his career.
