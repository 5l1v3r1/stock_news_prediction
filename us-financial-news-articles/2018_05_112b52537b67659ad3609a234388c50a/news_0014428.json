The 56 percent decline was just enough to top the record previously held by fellow Marvel title \"Black Panther,\" which made $111.6 million in its second weekend. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" holds the prize for biggest second weekend, with a mighty $149 million in 2015. Only five films have ever hit the $100 million-mark in their second weekends.\nIn just North America, the superhero mashup has made $450.8 million. Among \"Infinity War's\" numerous accomplishments is being the fastest film to gross $1 billion, in just 11 days. And the film has yet to open in China.\nOne of three weekend releases opening in \"Infinity War's\" almighty wake is \"Overboard,\" anchoring in the second spot with a solid $14 million in 1,623 theaters. The MGM and Lionsgate Pantelion remake of Goldie Hawn-Kurt Russell's classic romcom of the same name now stars Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez. That three-day estimate washes in slightly ahead of Derbez's last leading role, \"How to be a Latin Lover,\" which bowed with $12 million in 2017. \"Overboard\" is currently averaging a bleak 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. The audience score, however, is faring better with a 76 percent.\nSlipping to No. 3 in its fifth weekend is Paramount Picture's \"A Quiet Place.\" John Krasinski's horror thriller made $7.5 million in 3,413 locations, bringing its domestic total to an impressive $159.8 million. The third weekend of Amy Schumer's \"I Feel Pretty\" secured the fourth slot with $4.9 million from 3,232 theaters. Its North American tally currently sits at $37.8 million. Rounding out the top five is Dwayne Johnson's \"Rampage.\" The Warner Bros. film grossed $4.6 million in 3,151 locations. In four weeks, its domestic total is $84.7 million.\n\"Black Panther\" likely saw another boost from \"Infinity War.\" The Chadwick Boseman-starrer landed in sixth place, taking in $3.2 million from 1,641 locations in its 12th weekend. To date, \"Black Panther\" has made $693 million in North America.\nFocus Features' \"Tully,\" with Charlize Theron, Mackenzie Davis, Mark Duplass, and Ron Livingston, debuted with $3 million in 1,353 theaters. The comedy-drama directed by Jason Reitman and written by Diablo Cody has garnered a solid 89% certified rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nThe final weekend opener, Electric Entertainment's \"Bad Samaritan\" launched with $1.6 million from 2,007 locations. Dean Delvin's thriller starring David Tennant, Robert Sheehan, and Kerry Condon has a B- CinemaScore, along with a 56% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nThanks primarily to \"Infinity War,\" the year to date box office is up 5.2 percent, according to comScore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T09:35:25.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
