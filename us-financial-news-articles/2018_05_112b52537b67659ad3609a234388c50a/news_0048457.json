But the SNB — mindful of recent populist uprisings against executive pay and tax reforms — is taking no chances.\nJordan has fired several broadsides against the initiative, which he has branded a” dangerous cocktail” for Switzerland.\nPolls have got big decisions wrong in the past, as evidenced by Britain’s Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s U.S. election win.\nBut Lukas Golder, co-leader of pollsters GFS Bern, said chances for a sovereign money victory were remote.\nRelated Coverage Factbox: What you need to know about the Swiss sovereign money vote “A ‘no’ result is the probable outcome,” he said. “Unlike globalisation or migration issues, there has been no great mobilisation of voters.”\nInterest in sovereign money rose following the 2008 financial crisis after the Swiss government had to bail out UBS.\nSupporters say that allowing customers sovereign money accounts with the SNB would reduce the risk that bank runs will wreck Switzerland’s financial system.\n“When you ask most people where their money comes from, they will say it is the SNB, but that’s not true,” said Maurizio Degiacomi, a leader of the campaign by academics and ex-bankers.\n“When they learn that the money they use in their daily lives is actually produced by commercial banks, they want this changed.”\nThe Swiss banking establishment disagrees, saying great strides have been made to improve stability via regulations that make banks hold more capital.\nThe changes would also lead to an increase in the price of credit and higher banking charges, Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) Chief Economist Martin Hess said. Lenders would have to go to the money markets, other banks or the SNB for funding because they could no longer use customers’ current account deposits to finance loans.\nIn a study commissioned by the SBA, University of Lausanne economist Philippe Bacchetta reckoned a switch to sovereign money could cut Swiss gross domestic product by 0.4 percent.\n“This plan has never been attempted anywhere else, and if Switzerland was the only place to do this, it would be really risky,” said Jean-Charles Rochet, a University of Geneva economist.\nThe initiative would cause massive disruption to the Swiss banking system. Big banks could move their activities abroad so the regulations don’t apply, or might offer only accounts in euro or dollars to get around it, he said.\n“It’s good to have a discussion, but this is too technical an issue to be decided in a simple yes-no referendum,” said Rochet.\nStill, Freie Gemeinschaftbank’s Decressonnière thinks the time is right for a change.\n“The other banks have their own interests to defend. Creating money is a privilege the banks have and the big banks profit to a greater extent from this,” he said.\n“It would be painful for them to lose this, so it’s understandable why they are against it. But it is very surprising we are the only bank that supports the initiative.”\nReporting by John Revill, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:55:19.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
