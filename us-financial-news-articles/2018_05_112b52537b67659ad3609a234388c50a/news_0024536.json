(NASDAQ:CHUBA) (NASDAQ:CHUBK) (“CommerceHub,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), a leading distributed commerce network for retailers and brands, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We continued our track record of consistent revenue growth in the quarter,” said Frank Poore, CommerceHub’s Founder, President and CEO, “and we are excited to be joining GTCR and Sycamore Partners to continue executing as a strategic partner to many of the world’s leading retailers and brands.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $26.3 million, a 7% increase from $24.6 million in 2017.

Drop-ship order volume grew 13% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017. As announced in February 2018, we expanded our CommerceHub for Retailers network with the signing of Macy’s, a top 10 online retailer, as a new drop-ship customer.\nThe Merger\nA special meeting of our stockholders will take place at 12:00 p.m. local time, on May 18, 2018, at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112. At the special meeting, holders of our Series A and Series B common stock will be asked to vote on a proposal to adopt the agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) among CommerceHub, Great Dane Parent, LLC (“Parent”) and Great Dane Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger\") with and into CommerceHub, with CommerceHub continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by affiliates of GTCR LLC (\"GTCR\") and affiliates of Sycamore Partners Management, L.P. (\"Sycamore\") to facilitate the participation of investment funds advised by GTCR and Sycamore in the transaction. The closing of the Merger is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, but we cannot predict the exact timing of the completion of the Merger or whether the Merger will be completed. The closing of the Merger remains subject to, among other things, the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of our Series A and Series B common stock, and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. Further information is available in our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2018.\nNo Conference Call\nIn light of the pending Merger, the Company will not be hosting a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nAbout CommerceHub :\nCommerceHub is a distributed commerce network connecting supply, demand and delivery that helps retailers and brands increase sales by expanding product assortments, promoting products on the channels that perform, and enabling rapid, on-time customer delivery. With its robust platform and proven scalability, CommerceHub helped over 11,500 retailers, brands, and distributors achieve an estimated $16 billion in Gross Merchandise Value in 2017.\nImportant Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about future business strategies, future financial performance, cost savings, market conditions and potential, future growth of ecommerce, customer growth and performance, sales channel expansion, international expansion, the Merger (including the expected timetable for its completion) and other matters that are not historical facts. These statements involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, market acceptance and performance of our products and services, competitive issues, general market conditions, shareholder approval of the Merger Agreement, regulatory matters and changes in law affecting our business and the risk factors described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1A \"Risk Factors.” Further, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all potential risks or assess their potential effects on our business. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any such statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. There can be no assurance that any expectation or belief expressed in a forward-looking statement will occur, and you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and proxy statement, for additional information about us and the risks and uncertainties we face that may affect the forward-looking statements made in this press release.\nStatement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide non-GAAP financial measures that management considers in reviewing our financial performance because we feel they are relevant measures of the overall efficiency of our business model. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for, or superior to, and should be considered only in addition to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are subject to inherent limitations and exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. Certain of these adjustments are based on estimates and assumptions of management and do not purport to reflect actual historical results. In addition, you should be aware that our computation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate these measures in the same fashion. We define “adjusted gross profit” as gross profit plus share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization and restructuring charges. We define “adjusted gross margin” as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. We define “adjusted operating expenses” as total operating expenses less share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization and restructuring charges. We define “adjusted EBITDA” as net income or loss plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of capitalized software costs and intangible assets, share-based compensation, restructuring charges and Merger-related charges, less interest income and income tax benefit. We define “adjusted net income” as net income or loss plus share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization, restructuring charges and the tax effects of these adjustments, federal tax reform and other deferred charges. We define “adjusted earnings per diluted share” or “adjusted EPS” as earnings per diluted share plus the diluted per share effects of share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization, restructuring charges and the tax effects of these adjustments, federal tax reform and other deferred charges. We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by, or used in, operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring charges, the elimination of which does not result in a reduction of operating expenses necessary to conduct our business. By excluding these charges, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information that enables us and investors to better analyze our operating performance and the sustainability of our results and to compare our performance on a more consistent basis from period to period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest comparable GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial tables included at the end of this press release.\nCommerceHub Investor Relations Contact\nErik Morton\ninvestor@commercehub.com\nCommerceHub, Inc.
