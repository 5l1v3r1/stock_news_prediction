Trump denies collusion and has called congressional probes and an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller politically motivated witch hunts.\nThe committee found that Russia undertook a wide variety of intelligence-related activities targeting the U.S. voting process, beginning at least as early as 2014 and continuing through Election Day 2016.\n“The committee has not seen any evidence that vote tallies were manipulated or that voter registration information was deleted or modified,” the committee said in a statement.\nThe report said the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation alerted states to the threat during 2016, but the warnings “were limited in substance and distribution.”\nAs a result, it said, state officials understood there was a threat, but did not understand its scope or seriousness. It said DHS is engaging state election officials more seriously now.\nThe report’s recommendations included that states should continue to run elections and the U.S. government should “clearly communicate” that it will respond to attacks on election infrastructure as a hostile act, and respond accordingly.\nIt also said the United States should build a stronger defense, including quickly determining who is behind cyber attacks and improve communications.
