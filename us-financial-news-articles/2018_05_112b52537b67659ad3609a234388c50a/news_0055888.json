He gave no further details.\nA government official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said Zimbabwean authorities had contacted the South African but he was not forthcoming with information.\nA statement by the U.S. Department of Justice in Colorado dated May 21 said the South African conspired with the unidentified Colorado hunter to export the tusks by falsely saying in official documents the hunter was a South African resident and that the elephant was shot outside Gonarezhou.\nIt is illegal under Zimbabwean law for hunters to shoot animals inside a state game park.\nIn 2015, a U.S. dentist touched off a global storm when he killed a rare black-maned lion named Cecil with a bow and arrow outside Hwange National Park in western Zimbabwe, forcing the United States to suspend importation of elephant trophies from Africa.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T20:07:08.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
