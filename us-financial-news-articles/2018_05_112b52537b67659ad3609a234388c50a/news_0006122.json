The conversion into an O&M structure is a continuation of our strategy to build an asset-light operating model in markets where we do not have a significant concentration of assets, which should ultimately result in improved consolidated returns on capital.\n\"In our Rental Tools Services business, we experienced a slight decline in revenues and gross margin, but we see opportunities for growth in certain markets. We are also experiencing additional tendering activity for our Drilling Services business as oil prices have stabilized above $60 per barrel; however, the pricing environment remains challenging. We continue focusing on costs, enhancing efficiency, and maximizing financial flexibility, while remaining resilient and competitive in an evolving market,\" concluded Mr. Rich.\nFirst Quarter Review\nParker Drilling's revenues for the 2018 first quarter, compared with the 2017 fourth quarter, decreased 5.7 percent to $109.7 million from $116.3 million. Operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization expense (gross margin) decreased 25.8 percent to $18.1 million from $24.4 million and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 16.5 percent, compared with 21.0 percent for the 2017 fourth quarter.\nDrilling Services\nFor the Company's Drilling Services business, which is comprised of the U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling and International & Alaska Drilling segments, first quarter revenues decreased 7.6 percent to $57.5 million from $62.2 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. Gross margin decreased 63.0 percent to $2.0 million from $5.4 million, and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 3.5 percent, compared with 8.7 percent for the prior period. Contracted backlog was $246 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $241 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\nU.S. (Lower 48) Drilling\nU.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment revenues were $1.4 million, down from $1.5 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. Gross margin was a $2.7 million loss, unchanged from the 2017 fourth quarter. Results were similar to the prior quarter as market activity continues to be subdued in the inland waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\nInternational & Alaska Drilling\nInternational & Alaska Drilling segment revenues decreased 7.4 percent to $56.1 million from $60.6 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. Gross margin was $4.7 million, a 41.3 percent decrease from 2017 fourth quarter gross margin of $8.0 million. Revenues decreased primarily due to the reduced rig activity in Alaska, Sakhalin Island, Russia, and Kazakhstan, partially offset by increased reimbursable revenues. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the aforementioned inactive rigs and increased expenses in Kurdistan associated with a rig start-up. These negative gross margin impacts were partially offset by $3.0 million of inventory and asset related write-offs in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the first quarter.\nRental Tools Services\nFor the Company's Rental Tools Services business, which is comprised of the U.S. Rental Tools and International Rental Tools segments, first quarter revenues decreased 3.5 percent to $52.2 million from $54.1 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. Gross margin decreased 14.7 percent to $16.2 million from $19.0 million, and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 31.0 percent compared with 35.1 percent for the prior period.\nU.S. Rental Tools\nU.S. Rental Tools segment revenues decreased 4.4 percent to $34.7 million, from $36.3 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. Gross margin decreased 16.8 percent to $15.8 million from $19.0 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. The decline in revenues was due to decreased offshore rental activity partially offset by increased land activity. Gross margin declined primarily as a result of the change in revenue mix with lower offshore and increased land activity as well as increased inspection and repair expenses associated with the return of offshore rental equipment.\nInternational Rental Tools\nInternational Rental Tools segment revenues decreased 1.7 percent to $17.5 million from $17.8 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. Gross margin improved to $360 thousand from $11 thousand for the 2017 fourth quarter. Revenues were slightly down due to the timing of projects and gross margin was up, largely due to lower operating costs.\nConsolidated\nGeneral and Administrative expenses were $6.2 million for the 2018 first quarter, up from $5.1 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. The increase was primarily due to incentive compensation adjustments during the 2017 fourth quarter. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $170.2 million, consisting of $118.3 million cash and $51.9 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our cash balance decreased $23.2 million during the quarter, predominantly due to the semiannual interest payments of $20.6 million on our long-term debt.\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter were $8.9 million, with 94% dedicated to our Rental Tools Services business.\nConference Call\nParker Drilling has scheduled a conference call for 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, to review first quarter results.

evaluate and compare our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest expense from our outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), remeasurement of foreign currency transactions, tax consequences, impairment and other special items. Special items include items impacting operating expenses that management believes detract from an understanding of normal operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review current period operating performance and period to period comparisons. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(2) Special items include:\n- For the three months ended December 31, 2017, special items include a $3.0 million write-off of inventory associated with select international drilling assets.
