Sometimes it can feel like their only option is to run away,” she said.\nLocal authorities often have little choice about where to place children as private care providers are expensive and care homes unevenly distributed throughout the country, Coffey said.\nA spokesman said the Department for Education was working to improve responses to children going missing, and now required all care homes to have a clear policy for preventing this from happening.\nAt least 13,000 people across the country are estimated by the government to be living in modern slavery but police say the true figure is likely to be in the tens of thousands.\nThe number of British children referred as potential victims of trafficking more than doubled last year, said Jakub Sobik of anti-trafficking group Anti-Slavery International.\n“It’s difficult to escape the conclusion that the UK is failing its most vulnerable children,” he said.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Claire Cozens.
