Edited excerpts below:\nHow are companies dealing with the pressure to make diverse business apps and data work together?\nIf you talk to any CIO, they’re feeling this across every sector of the economy. Companies are increasingly defined by the software that they run. The value that we provide to these organizations is by giving them a way to plug these things into each other in a way that gives them leverage over the capabilities in those apps. This is a massive challenge.\nBig organizations are struggling, because in the past ten to 15 years, software practices have greatly improved and what we’re doing is helping enterprises retrofit their legacy tools with a much more modern architecture and approach.\nWhat is the impact of juggling old and new IT tools on businesses or their customers?\nMost IT organizations are in this loop where they’ve got to move faster, and do more projects, because there’s more software in the business. So the pressure is greater to move quickly and do things, like find a band-aid solution. And that’s starting to fail pretty significantly, which is why we have these big outages.\nEvery increment in efficiency, or providing better services and products to consumers, or having better employee services, hinges on being able to unlock data and capabilities around the enterprise.\nWhat’s an application network and how does it help?\nScale and reuse is really important. Before us, you would do integration and it would serve its purpose but serve no other purpose, and that’s actually really expensive.\nThe capability that we define as reusable is this idea of an application network. The concept is pretty simple. Everything on the application network is pluggable. That means you can plug things in and plug them back out again. It’s a bit like a Cisco network, but for applications. So it’s not just about bringing new technology in, but connecting it to the old stuff so that you get the most value out of it.\nWhat is the impact of the acquisition by Salesforce?\nThings haven’t changed too much for us. The company is still being run by our CEO [Greg Schott]. We’re running the same vision and product strategy, before and after. The reason being is because what we’re doing is working. We connect everything, and one reason our customers like us is that we have strong neutrality to any applications or any platform.\nWe’re very focused on maintaining that neutrality. That makes a ton of sense for Salesforce and a ton of sense for us, because the data lives everywhere. You don’t want to be just about the piece of a sales cloud. You want to be able to reach everything, everywhere.\nShare this: API DATA MULESOFT ROSS MASON SALESFORCE.COM Previous The Morning Download: H&M, on Losing Streak, Turns to AI for Growth Next ThoughtSpot Raises $145 Million to Expand AI-Driven Analytics Platform", "external_links": ["http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mulesoft-announces-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2017-1015937361"], "published": "2018-05-08T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T08:03:13.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
