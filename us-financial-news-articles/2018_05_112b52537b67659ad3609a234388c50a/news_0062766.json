It strengthened 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc , bouncing sharply from near 3-month lows.\nItalian 10-year government bond yields dropped 10 basis points to 2.35 percent in early trade while two-year yields dropped as much as 14 bps and was set for its biggest daily drop in three years.\nThe closely-watched Italian/German 10-year bond yield spread tightens nearly 15 bps from Friday’s close.\nEuropean stock futures rose on Monday, indicating a stronger open across euro zone benchmarks as an anti-establishment government failed to materialise in Italy and the U.S. showed signs of progressing towards a summit with North Korea.
