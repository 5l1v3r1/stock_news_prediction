Copper was likely to find some price support after an Indian state on Monday ordered the permanent closure of a copper smelter controlled by London-listed Vedanta Resources following the deaths of 13 protesters last week. \"That's not minor to the market, if it is a shutdown that persists,\" said analyst Vivek Dhar of Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \"I am surprised it hasn't resulted in more of an impact. It could be the result of the holidays, and we may see it later this week.\" In Shanghai, nickel, used in stainless steel, rose 2.8 percent to the highest in three years, while galvanising metal zinc rallied 1.5 percent, spurring gains in London, which returned from a long holiday weekend. The price of rebar has risen 15 percent from late March, buoyed by a seasonal recovery in China's construction activity that pushed mills to ramp up output after winter production curbs aimed at fighting smog were lifted in mid-March.
