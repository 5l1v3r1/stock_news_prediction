We are capitalizing on the strong industrial fundamentals in our Ontario and Quebec markets which positions the Trust well for continued stability and growth. Our focus on active asset management continues to yield positive results and we recently completed significant lease deals on two properties in the Greater Toronto Area that we had previously considered selling. With higher rents that increase the value of these properties by over 25%, we are retaining these assets for the long-term, demonstrating our ability to generate organic growth in our strongest markets and increase our net asset value.\nWith 2.8 million square feet of Class A industrial properties in the Southeastern U.S. acquired in the past six months, we will continue to capitalize on unique and attractive industrial opportunities in both Canada and the U.S., including identifying new development projects and increasing the scope of the asset recycling program to improve the overall quality of our portfolio. ”\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet income – Net income increased by $31.7 million compared to Q1 2017 due to positive fair value adjustment to investment properties due to higher investment properties valuations, slightly offset by negative fair value adjustment on the Trust’s subsidiary redeemable units as the Trust’s unit price increased. These fair value adjustments are excluded from the calculation of FFO. The investment property acquisitions completed during the last quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018 contributed an additional $3.2 million in net rental income. Diluted FFO (1) per unit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 22.4 cents, relatively stable compared to 22.2 cents for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Comparative properties NOI growth was offset by lower leverage during the quarter. Total first quarter NOI (1) increased 14.4% over the first quarter of 2017 – Total NOI for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $32.5 million or $4.1 million higher compared to Q1 2017. The increase in NOI compared to the same quarter last year was mainly due to higher comparative properties NOI and acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2018 and fourth quarter of 2017. Comparative properties NOI (1) for the quarter increased by 2.8% over the first quarter of 2017. Comparative properties NOI for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $29.4 million or $0.8 million higher when compared to Q1 2017. The increase in comparative properties NOI compared to Q1 2017 was as a result of higher NOI from Ontario and Eastern Canada where the average occupancies were higher, slightly offset by lower NOI from the Western Canada and Quebec regions where the average occupancies were lower. Leasing profile – Strong leasing momentum has continued for a sixth straight quarter with occupancy over 95%. Leasing activity during the first quarter included 240,000 square feet of new leases, 990,000 square feet of renewals, and lease commitments of 221,000 square feet, compared to 1,271,000 square feet of expiries and early terminations for the same quarter. The average remaining lease term at March 31, 2018 is 4.1 years. Portfolio occupancy up 50 bps in first quarter and retention ratio of 82.7% – Overall occupancy (including committed space) was 97.1%, an increase from 96.6% at December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, comparative portfolio occupancy is 96.7% compared to 96.5% at December 31, 2017. Positive rental spreads on Ontario renewals – During the quarter, the Trust completed 990,000 square feet of renewals at rates $0.04 or 0.6% higher than expiring rates. Of these deals, renewals totaling 695,000 square feet were in the Trust’s Ontario portfolio at rates 2.0% higher than expiring rents. Two single-tenants representing almost half of these renewals were transacted over a year ago at 6.3% negative renewal spreads as the focus was on retention and occupancy. Excluding these two deals, our renewal spread in Ontario would have been 8.0% higher than expiry. With our recent focus on increased rents in the Ontario region, we have transacted 682,000 square feet of deals at rates $0.66 or 11.3% above expiry or prior in-place rents which take occupancy in 2018. Increasing market rents – Market rents increased to 4.1% above the in-place rents for our Canadian portfolio primarily reflecting the strong demand for industrial space in Ontario. Investment properties – The Trust’s investment property portfolio consists of 219 properties with a value of $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2017. U.S. acquisitions totalling $115 million were completed in the quarter, and the Trust’s Ontario and Quebec properties increased by $57 million reflecting higher underlying cash flows, market rents and lower capitalization and discount rates. Net Assets Value (“NAV”) (1),(7) per unit – The Trust’s NAV per unit increased by $0.50 or 5.4% to $9.85 this quarter, largely from higher investment properties values in Ontario and Quebec.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nKey performance indicators March 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017 Level of debt (debt-­to-­total assets) (1) 49.5 % 49.5 % Interest coverage ratio (1) 3.4 times\n3.3 times Weighted average face interest rate on all debt (5) 3.77 % 3.75 % Debt – weighted average term to maturity (years) 3.9 3.8 Unencumbered assets (6) $ 222,808 $ 113,191 Undrawn lines of credit 89,639 123,000 See footnotes .
