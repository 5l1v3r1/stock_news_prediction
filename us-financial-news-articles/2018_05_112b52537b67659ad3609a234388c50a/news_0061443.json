(NASDAQ: KTOV; TASE: KTOV), an innovative biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Consensi™ (amlodipine and celecoxib) oral tablets for marketing.\nConsensi™ is a patent-protected combination of celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and amlodipine besylate, an antihypertensive calcium channel blocker. Consensi™ was approved for once daily use in three dosage forms, corresponding to the current approved dosages of amlodipine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg) for hypertension and a 200 mg dose of celecoxib for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain.\n“We are very pleased with Consensi™’s approval and would like to thank the members of Kitov’s team, consultants and investigators, as well as the FDA’s Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products, for all of their support and assistance,” said Dr. J. Paul Waymack, Chairman of Kitov's Board and Chief Medical Officer. “Consensi™ provides a safe and effective combination treatment option for the millions of Americans who suffer from osteoarthritis pain and hypertension.\n“Now that Consensi™ has been approved for marketing, our clinical and regulatory teams will focus on leveraging their drug development expertise to advance NT219, an exciting investigational new drug candidate currently in development for various oncology indications.”\nIsaac Israel, Kitov’s CEO, added: “This approval demonstrates the Kitov team’s ability and experience in expertly guiding Consensi™ through clinical trials and regulatory review, from Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to FDA approval in less than four years.\n“Over 50 million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis. About 1 of 3 U.S. adults or about 75 million people have high blood pressure*, known as the “silent killer” due to the absence of noticeable symptoms. As a result, patients’ adherence to the hypertension treatment regimen is low. We believe that Consensi™, as a single pill combination treatment for osteoarthritis and hypertension, presents a unique value proposition of potentially increasing treatment adherence.\n“We recently expanded our commercialization network for Consensi™ by securing a second licensing agreement in Asia with a major Chinese pharmaceutical company. The FDA approval of Consensi™ puts us in a stronger position towards securing commercial partnerships for the U.S. and other key territories.”\nThe FDA-approved Consensi™ New Drug Application included the positive results from the Company’s Phase III clinical trial. These data demonstrated that the study met its primary endpoint of showing that the drug lowers daytime systolic blood pressure by at least 50% of the reduction in blood pressure achieved in patients treated with amlodipine besylate only, with statistical significance of p=0.001. Kitov also submitted the positive results from its randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled renal function Phase III/IV clinical trial of Consensi™. Data from this study validated the primary efficacy endpoint achieved in the completed Phase III clinical trial. This study also demonstrated that treatment with Consensi™ led to a statistically significant reduction of serum creatinine, a marker of renal function, from its baseline value (p=0.0005), demonstrating improved renal function in patients treated with the combination. In contrast, neither amlodipine besylate nor placebo lowered creatinine to a statistically significant level.\n* According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/index.htm )\nAbout Consensi™\nFull US Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING and Medication Guide is available at: www.consensi.com .\nIndications and Usage:\nConsensi™ is a combination of amlodipine besylate, a calcium channel blocker, and celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indicated for patients for whom treatment with amlodipine for hypertension and celecoxib for osteoarthritis are appropriate. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal CV events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\nLimitations of Use:\nConsensi™ is only available in a celecoxib strength of 200 mg and is only to be taken once daily.\nImportant Safety Information (ISI) for Consensi™\nThe following ISI is based on the Highlights section of the U.S. Prescribing Information for Consensi™. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all of the labelled safety information for Consensi™.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in the treatment and may increase with duration of use.\nConsensi™ is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass\ngraft (CABG) surgery.\nNSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events.\nConsensi™ is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to amlodipine, celecoxib or any of its inactive ingredients.\nConsensi™ is contraindicated in patients with a known history of asthma, urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs and in the setting of CABG surgery.\nConsensi™ is contraindicated in patients with known demonstrated allergic-type reactions to sulfonamides.\nSignificant warnings and precautions related to Consensi™ include the following:\nPatients should be warned about the potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure. Physicians should discontinue Consensi™ if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.\nPatients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Physicians should carefully monitor blood pressure.\nSymptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\nWorsening angina and acute myocardial infarction, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, is possible.\nPhysicians should avoid use of Consensi™ in patients with severe heart failure.\nPhysicians should monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia, and avoid the use of Consensi™ in patients with advanced renal disease.\nPatients should seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.\nConsensi™ is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity).\nPhysicians should discontinue Consensi™ at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity.\nNSAIDs such as Consensi™ can cause premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus.\nAvoid use in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation.\nPhysicians should monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia.\nConsensi™ is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment or severe renal insufficiency.\nConsensi™ is not recommended in Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates.\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Kitov Pharma at 1-800-651-6606 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch\nAbout Kitov Pharma\nKitov Pharma (Kitov Pharma Ltd.; NASDAQ/TASE: KTOV) is an innovative biopharmaceutical drug development group of companies.
