REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File photo State-owned banks Caixa Econômica Federal and Banco do Brasil SA and pension funds including Petros, Previ and Funcef also took part in the action, Brazilian newspaper Valor Econômico said, citing sources familiar with the matter.\nThe move seeks to replicate a January settlement inked by U.S. investors who received nearly $3 billion from Petrobras for claims stemming from a massive corruption scandal, in which contractors bribed company officials and politicians to win inflated contracts from the company.\nValor said foreign funds were also involved in the arbitration, which is being conducted in the Market Arbitration Chamber of the B3 segment of the São Paulo Stock Exchange.\nRepresentatives for Petrobras, Itaú, Bradesco, Santander, Caixa Econômica Federal, Banco do Brasil, Petros and Funcef did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Previ declined to comment.\nReporting by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Paul Simao\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:47:07.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
