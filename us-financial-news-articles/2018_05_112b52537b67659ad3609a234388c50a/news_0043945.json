Brazil's central bank on Friday had said it would triple the currency swap contracts - equivalent to operations to sell dollars in futures markets - offered daily, after the real fell to its lowest level in more than two years. The real on Monday rose 1.35 percent, although traders said the currency might have risen more had it not been for market caution ahead of the scheduled release on Tuesday of the Brazilian central bank minutes. Mexico's peso briefly blew past 20 per dollar, touching its weakest level since March 2017, before slightly rebounding. The peso is likely to trade weaker than 20 to the dollar as talks drag out to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, analysts at Mexico's Banco Base said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday said major issues remained among the United States, Canada and Mexico to rework the treaty, and that there was no specific deadline. In Argentina, the volatile peso strengthened 0.23 percent amid optimism over ongoing efforts by the government to obtain a financing line from the International Monetary Fund. Stocks suffered across Latin America, led by Brazil's Bovespa index, down 1.28 percent, and Mexico's IPC index , down about 0.80 percent. In Brazil, shares of iron ore producer Vale S.A. fell more than 3 percent, in line with the drop in China's iron ore futures to their weakest level in two weeks.
