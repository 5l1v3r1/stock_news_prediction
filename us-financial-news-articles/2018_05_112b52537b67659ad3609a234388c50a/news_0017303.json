Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday she had offered to step aside for fear the hearing would damage the CIA.\nThe Washington Post first reported her offer to withdraw.\n“My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists ... Win Gina!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.\nTrump nominated Haspel, who would be the first woman to lead the intelligence agency, to succeed Mike Pompeo, who has become secretary of state.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\nCritics of Haspel’s nomination have taken issue with her role in a defunct program in which the CIA detained and interrogated al Qaeda suspects in secret prisons abroad using techniques, including waterboarding, widely condemned as torture.\nFormer President George W. Bush authorized the Rendition, Detention and Interrogation Program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nMany details of Haspel’s work remain classified. Sources familiar with her career who requested anonymity said she was at one point the chief of the CIA station in a country where harsh interrogations were used on at least one terrorism suspect.
