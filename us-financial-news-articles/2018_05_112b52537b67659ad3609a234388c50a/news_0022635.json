(\"IDT\") of 7.7x in April 2018 (as set out below). Similar to Horizon, IDT utilizes technologies such as next generation sequencing, CRISPR genome editing, qPCR, and RNAi to manufacture custom nucleic acid products for the life sciences industry including in the areas of academic research, biotechnology, molecular diagnostics and pharmaceutical development. However, relative to IDT, the Board believes that Horizon has a broader and more innovative product portfolio, which provides the Company with the opportunity to realise superior growth.\nThe Board has made it clear that it believes that the Unsolicited Proposal fundamentally undervalues Horizon and that it sees little strategic merit in the proposed combination.\nEnterprise Value (\"EV\") / Consensus Estimated Revenue Multiples for Calendar Year (\"CY\") 2018 For Selected Horizon Peer group\nCompany EV / CY 18E Revenue Multiple Illumina, Inc. 10.9x Abcam plc. 10.1x Intrexon Corp. 8.9x Bio-Techne Corp. 8.6x Repligen Corp. 8.1x Evotec AG 6.2x Qiagen NV 5.5x Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. 4.3x Median 8.4x Source: FactSet consensus as of 4 May 2018 (the latest practicable date before this announcement)\nAcquisition of IDT by Danaher\n(EV / Last Twelve Months (\"LTM\") Revenue Multiple) 7.7x Implied EV / CY18 Consensus Estimated Revenue Multiple for Abcam's Unsolicited Proposal 4.0x Enquiries:\nHorizon Discovery Group plc\nIan Gilham, Executive Chairman\nTerry Pizzie, Chief Executive Officer\nRichard Vellacott, Chief Financial Officer +44 (0) 1223 655 580 Evercore (Lead Financial Adviser to Horizon Discovery Group plc)\nSimon Elliott\nEdward Banks +44 (0) 20 7653 6000 Numis (Joint Financial Adviser, Broker and NOMAD to Horizon Discovery Group plc)\nMichael Meade\nFreddie Barnfield +44 (0) 20 7260 1000 Consilium Strategic Communications (Financial Media and Investor Relations to Horizon Discovery Group plc)\nMary-Jane Elliott\nMatthew Neal\nMelissa Gardiner +44 (0) 20 3709 5701 Sources of Information\nThe Enterprise Value / Consensus estimated revenue for Calendar Year 2018 trading multiples referenced above are based on the following data, which is entirely sourced from FactSet as of 4 May 2018, the latest practicable date before this announcement.\nCompany Enterprise Value (EV) (£m) CY18E Revenue (£m) EV / CY18E Revenue Multiple Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. 75,611 17,609 4.3x Illumina, Inc. 25,606 2,359 10.9x Qiagen NV 6,261 1,140 5.5x Bio-Techne Corp. 4,224 491 8.6x Abcam plc 2,498 247 10.1x Evotec AG 2,068 296 6.2x Intrexon Corp. 1,691 191 8.9x Repligen Corp. 1,104 136 8.1x The CY18E revenue used represents estimated revenues for the twelve months ending 31 December 2018.\nAbcam's 2018 fiscal year ends on 30 June 2018 and the CY18E revenue used for Abcam is an average of consensus estimated revenue for the fiscal years ending 30 June 2018 (£235m) and 30 June 2019 (£259m).\nBio-Techne's 2018 fiscal year ends on 30 June 2018 and the CY18E revenue used for Bio-Techne is an average of consensus estimated revenue for the fiscal years ending 30 June 2018 (US$636m) and 30 June 2019 (US$692m).\nWhere required, all financials have been converted to British Pounds using the following exchange rates, US$:£ 0.73978 and €:£ 0.88260.\nThe Enterprise Value / Last Twelve Months revenue multiple for Danaher's acquisition of IDT is sourced from financial information disclosed on page 12 of Danaher's 10-Q filing with the SEC for the quarter ended 30 March 2018.
