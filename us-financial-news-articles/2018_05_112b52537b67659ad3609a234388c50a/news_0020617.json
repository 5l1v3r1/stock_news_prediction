It’s about being controlled and relaxed and not worrying too much. Goffin is a top player so I’m very pleased.\n“My new trick is to try and continue that momentum and not just have a good win and not back it up.”\nEdmund will next face Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who achieved a 6-4 6-4 win over compatriot Milos Raonic.\n“It was definitely one of my best days on clay,” said 19-year-old Shapovalov, who is ranked 43rd in the world, 19 places below Raonic. “To be on the court against such a legend for me, and for my country, it was an honor.\n“What (Raonic) does for our country, for tennis, for these past couple years, it’s incredible. To beat him, it was a huge confidence booster for me.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru,; Editing by Neville Dalton and Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T22:57:10.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
