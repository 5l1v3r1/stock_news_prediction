REUTERS/Rodolfo Buhrer Abcam said in a written statement that it still encouraged drivers to protest, but to do so peacefully and without blocking roads. The blockades have crippled several key sectors of Latin America’s biggest economy.\nAbcam said it was “lamentable” that President Michel Temer had authorized Brazil’s military to use force if needed to clear roadways, but that given the threat, it urged truckers to open highways.\nReporting by Jose Roberto Gomes; Writing by Brad Brooks; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T09:17:31.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
