GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.39 per diluted share over 10.9 million shares, an increase of 86% from $0.21 per diluted share over 10.7 million shares in the first quarter of 2017. Backlog was $309 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $225 million as of April 1, 2017.\n“We are pleased to report excellent 2018 first quarter results across the board, evidenced by increases in revenues, organic growth, EBITDA, net income, EPS and backlog,” said Dickerson Wright, PE, Chairman and CEO of NV5. “These results were achieved through disciplined cross-selling within our existing offices, an optimized integration process for acquisitions, and a focus on the scalability of our growing platform.”\nOperating Results\nTotal Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $95.5 million, a 47% increase from the first quarter of 2017. Total Revenues includes intercompany revenues where the Company internally provided services in lieu of using a third-party sub-consultant. Gross Revenues - GAAP for the first quarter of 2018 were $94.5 million, a 48% increase from the first quarter of 2017. Net Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $77.2 million, an increase of 45% from the first quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $10.1 million, or 13% of Net Revenues, an increase of 101% from $5.0 million or 9% of Net Revenues for the first quarter of last year.\nAdjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.59 per diluted share compared to $0.39 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.3 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.39 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP EPS and Adjusted EPS reflect weighted-average shares outstanding of 10,913,315 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to weighted-average shares outstanding of 10,719,331 for the first quarter of 2017.\nCash flows from operating activities for first quarter of 2018 were $3.6 million compared to cash flows of $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $17.2 million compared to $18.8 million as of December 30, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company reported a twelve-month backlog of $309 million, compared to $225 million as of April 1, 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is raising its guidance for Full Year 2018 Gross Revenues, Net Revenues, Adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS, including the impact of acquisitions closed through April 30, 2018. The Company expects Gross Revenues will range from $380 million to $415 million, which represents an increase of 14% to 25% from 2017 Gross Revenues of $333 million. Net Revenues is expected to range from $304 million to $332 million, which represents an increase of 13% to 24% from 2017 Net Revenues of $268 million. The Company expects that Full Year 2018 Adjusted EPS will range from $3.00 per share to $3.30 per share, an increase of 26% to 39%. Furthermore, the Company expects that Full Year 2018 GAAP EPS will range from $2.26 per share to $2.54 per share. This guidance for Gross Revenues, Net Revenues, Adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS excludes anticipated acquisitions for the remainder of 2018.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal Revenues and Net Revenues are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Gross Revenues – GAAP include sub-consultant costs and other direct costs which are generally pass-through costs. Furthermore, Gross Revenues – GAAP eliminates intercompany revenues where the Company performed the service in lieu of using a third-party sub-consultant. Therefore, the Company believes that Total Revenues and Net Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry, provide a meaningful perspective on its business results. A reconciliation of gross revenues as reported in accordance with GAAP to Total Revenues and Net Revenues is provided at the end of this news release.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management believes EBITDA, in addition to operating profit, net income and other GAAP measures, is a useful indicator of NV5’s financial and operating performance and its ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes, capital expenditures and debt service. A reconciliation of net income as reported in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA is provided at the end of this news release.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share data (“Adjusted EPS”) is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted EPS reflects adjustments to reported diluted earnings per share (“GAAP EPS”) data to eliminate amortization expense of intangible assets from acquisitions, net of tax benefits. As the Company continues its acquisition strategy, the growth in Adjusted EPS will likely increase at a greater rate than GAAP EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EPS is provided at the end of this news release.\nNV5’s definition of Total Revenues, Net Revenues, EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as contract revenues, net income and diluted earnings per share.\nConference Call\nNV5 will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on May 3, 2018.\nDate: Thursday, May 3, 2018 Time: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Toll-free dial-in number: +1 844-348-6875 International dial-in number: +1 509-844-0152 Conference ID: 6669269 Webcast: http://ir.nv5.com The conference call will be webcast live and available for replay via the “Investors” section of the NV5 website.\nAbout NV5\nNV5 Global, Inc.
