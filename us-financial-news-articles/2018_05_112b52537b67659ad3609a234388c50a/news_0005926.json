REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge filed charges at the Supreme Court, according to a written statement from the federal prosecutor’s office.\nMaggi denies any wrongdoing, said the press office of the agriculture minister in a written statement.\nUnder Brazilian law, Maggi, as a government minister, can only face a trial if the Supreme Court approves it. There was no indication on Wednesday as to when the court would make a decision.\nDodge accused Maggi of participating in a scheme to pay a judge on the Mato Grosso state audit court 12 million reais ($3.4 million) in public funds to retire, so that Sergio Ricardo de Almeida, who was a Mato Grosso state lawmaker, could take the post, which he did.\nAlmeida was removed from the court last year and faces a trial in a lower-level federal court in connection with the supposed scheme.\nAlmeida could not be reached for comment.\n($1 = 3.5515 Brazilian reais)\nReporting by Ricardo Brito in Brasilia and Eduardo Simoes in Sao Paulo; writing by Ana Mano, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T02:44:25.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
