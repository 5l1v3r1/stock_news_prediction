It's now valued at $100,000.\nThey take the La Femme out for a ride in Allen's hometown of Detroit. There, the comedian tells stories about his early years on stage, drag racing on Woodward Avenue, and his brief stint in prison for drug violations, before landing his iconic role on the ABC sitcom \"Home Improvement.\"\nEager to please his guest and entertain his viewers at the same time, Leno tells Allen, \"I'm going to make your dream come true. We're going to relive the past. I talked to the police. They're going to set up a drag race for you and I on Woodward.\"\nCNBC | Jay Leno's Garage Tim Allen in the seat of a 1916 Ford Model T Runabout next to Jay Leno \"I'm cautiously optimistic that this will be fun,\" says Allen. They arrive on Woodward to find two 1916 Ford Model T Runabouts with 20 horsepower engines and top speeds of 45 mph.\n\"I can't trust you,\" Allen says when he sees the cars. But he exacts his vengeance by winning their race even after giving up an early lead. \"You had a weight disadvantage,\" he tells Leno.\nLeno, a good loser, at last gives The Tool Man what he came for: A chance behind the wheel of the Dodge Demon.\nCNBC | Jay Leno's Garage 2018 Dodge SRT Demon The car sells for $89,062 and is powered by a 840-horsepower Supercharged Hemi V8 engine. Its top speed is 168 mph, and it is capable of going 0 to 60 in just 2.3 seconds. (Later in the episode, Leno hits 200 mph in a 2019 Chevy Corvette ZR1.)\n\"Yeah baby,\" Allen yells, as spots the Demon coming in the distance. \"Hell yeah!\"\nHe hops in and blasts off down Woodward, churning up a cloud of burnt rubber. Then, after Leno looks at the camera and says, \"I got another surprise for Tim,\" a police car takes off in pursuit.\nCNBC's \" Jay Leno's Garage \" airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET.\nLike this story?
