Ligand management will host a conference call today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time to discuss this announcement and answer questions.\n\"Our financial and business results were excellent, highlighted by significant progress with several of our leading partnered assets. Melinta Therapeutics launched newly-approved intravenous Baxdela in the U.S. and their partners made regulatory filings in new geographies. Sage Therapeutics filed a new drug application for intravenous brexanolone for the treatment of postpartum depression and Retrophin initiated a Phase 3 trial with sparsentan for treating focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. We also out-licensed our GRA program, previously our main internal development program, and initiated a new R&D program to address unmet needs in the diagnostic imaging market,\" said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer of Ligand. \"Ligand’s Shots-on-Goal business model, with its focus on diversification and expense minimization, is continuing to generate increasing cash flow, and we expect this momentum to build throughout the remainder of 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues of 2018 were $56.2 million, compared with $29.3 million for the same period in 2017. Royalties were $20.8 million, compared with $24.2 million of 2017 and $14.2 million for the second quarter of 2017. Under the new accounting standard ASC 606, adopted as of the start of 2018, first quarter 2018 royalties should be compared with second quarter 2017 royalties due to the timing of revenue recognition. First quarter 2018 royalties primarily consisted of royalties from Promacta ® , Kyprolis ® and EVOMELA ® . Material sales were $4.4 million, compared with $1.1 million for the same period in 2017 due to the timing of Captisol purchases for use in clinical trials and commercial products. License fees, milestones and other revenues were $30.9 million, compared with $3.9 million for the same period in 2017, primarily due to a $20 million upfront payment received upon the licensing of Ligand’s GRA program and other milestones received.\nCost of goods sold was $0.8 million of 2018, compared with $0.3 million for the same period in 2017. Amortization of intangibles was $3.3 million, compared with $2.7 million for the same period in 2017. Research and development expense was $7.4 million, compared with $8.7 million for the same period of 2017 due primarily to lower spending on the GRA program partnered in the first quarter 2018. General and administrative expense was $7.6 million, compared with $7.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nGAAP net income of 2018 was $45.3 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, compared with $5.1 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the same period in 2017. First quarter of 2018 included a one-time, non-cash gain due to a change in the accounting for our investment in Viking Therapeutics, which resulted in marking the investment to market. Adjusted net income of 2018 was $35.7 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $12.6 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Ligand had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $264.4 million in addition to our $27.5 million investment in Viking Therapeutics. Cash generated from operations was $60.8 million of 2018.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nLigand affirms previous guidance for 2018 revenue to be approximately $184 million, including royalties of approximately $116 million, material sales of approximately $23 million and license fees and milestones of approximately $45 million, with the potential for up to an additional $20 million in license fees and milestones. Ligand notes that with revenue of $184 million, adjusted earnings per diluted share would be approximately $4.85.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Business Highlights\nPromacta ® /Revolade ®\nNovartis reported first quarter 2018 net sales of Promacta/Revolade (eltrombopag) of $257 million, an $82 million or 47% increase over the same period in 2017. Novartis announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Promacta for use in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of patients with severe aplastic anemia as a first-line therapy.\nKyprolis ® (carfilzomib), an Amgen Product Utilizing Captisol\nOn April 24, 2018, Amgen reported first quarter net sales of Kyprolis of $222 million, a $32 million or 17% increase over the same period in 2017. On May 9, 2018, Ono Pharmaceutical Company is expected to report Kyprolis sales in Japan for the most recent quarter. On January 17, 2018, Amgen announced that the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application to add overall survival (OS) data from the Phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR trial to the Prescribing Information for Kyprolis. On January 30, 2018, Amgen announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for Kyprolis to include updated OS data from the Phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR trial in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ligand received a $20 million upfront license fee, and is eligible to receive up to an additional $528.8 million of milestone payments and tiered royalties ranging from low double digits to the mid-teens, with the top tier applying to annual net sales above $3 billion. Roivant is responsible for all costs related to the program. Ligand announced worldwide license agreements with venBio Partners, Ferring Pharmaceuticals and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals to use the OmniAb platform technologies to discover fully human antibodies.

The Company’s financial measures under GAAP include stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt-related costs, amortization related to acquisitions and intangible assets, changes in contingent liabilities, net losses of Viking Therapeutics, mark-to-market adjustment for amounts owed to licensors, fair value adjustments to Viking Therapeutics convertible note receivable and warrants, unissued shares relating to the Senior Convertible Notes and others that are listed in the itemized reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted financial measures included at the end of this press release. However, other than with respect to total revenue, the Company only provides guidance on an adjusted basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking adjusted measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for changes in contingent liabilities, net losses of Viking Therapeutics, stock-based compensation expense, mark-to-market adjustments for amounts owed to licensors, effects of any discrete income tax items and fair value adjustments to Viking Therapeutics convertible note receivable. Management has excluded the effects of these items in its adjusted measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing the Company’s past and future core operating performance. Additionally, adjusted earnings per diluted share is a key component of the financial metrics utilized by the Company’s board of directors to measure, in part, management’s performance and determine significant elements of management’s compensation.\nConference Call\nLigand management will host a conference call today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss this announcement and answer questions.
