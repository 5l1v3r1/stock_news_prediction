Holders of the sukuk contest its position and are demanding to be paid back.\nWhile legal proceedings are continuing in British and United Arab Emirates courts, talks to find an out-of-court settlement have so far failed to find a resolution.\nBut the company and a committee of creditors are now very close to an agreement, the sources said.\nBoth a Dana Gas spokesperson and a spokesperson for the creditors’ committee declined to comment.\nThe proposed restructuring terms would see Dana pay 20 percent of the bonds and roll the rest of the security amount into three-year bonds with a 4 percent profit rate.\nThe new bonds would have no convertible option, which was a feature of part of the contested $700 million sukuk.\nThe new terms are still being discussed and no agreement has been signed, said one of the sources close to the matter, adding the parties could still walk away from the potential deal.\nIn a previous proposal, Dana offered to redeem 10 percent of the sukuk in cash and to roll over the remaining 90 percent over four years at an annual profit rate of 4 percent. It also offered to buy back up to half of the bonds at a 15 percent discount, sources told Reuters in February.\nThat proposal was rejected by the creditors’ committee, advised by investment bank Moelis.
