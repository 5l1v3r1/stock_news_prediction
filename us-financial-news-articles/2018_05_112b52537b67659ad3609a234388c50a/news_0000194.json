The economy should return to growth this year, but industry margins remain under pressure.\nSaudi Arabia is seeking to tempt foreign entrants across industries as it embarks on a massive overhaul of its economy to diversify away from a reliance on oil revenues.\nAt the moment, international players including Bupa, MetLife, Allianz and AXA all operate in the kingdom through partnerships with local ventures. These foreign companies often have management control of the business, although limited ownership levels.\nThe draft rules made clear that licences from the central bank for specific insurance lines would be dependent on foreign applicants having approval from regulators in their home countries for the same activities for at least the past five years.\nThey also specified that in order to open a branch, insurers would have to place a deposit, ranging from 60 million riyals ($16 million) for the highest-rated insurers to 200 million riyals for the lowest, in a local bank. The deposit requirement was higher for reinsurers.
