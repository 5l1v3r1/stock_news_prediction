But its forecast for oil GDP was cut marginally because of lower than expected oil output in the first quarter of this year.\nFor next year the central bank expects overall GDP to expand 3.1 percent on the back of 4.3 percent growth in the non-oil economy and a 0.1 percent uptick in oil GDP.\nThe UAE’s residential real estate market continued to decline in the first quarter of this year, with prices dropping 4.2 percent from a year earlier in Dubai and 7.8 percent in Abu Dhabi, the central bank said.\nReporting by Andrew Torchia; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:08:48.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
