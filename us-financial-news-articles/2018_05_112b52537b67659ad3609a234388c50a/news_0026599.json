Positive cash flows from operating activities of $549,172. Entered into a loan agreement with Barak Fund SPC Limited with respect to a US$5,000,000 secured loan facility to fund the restart of Galaxy. Signed an earn-in option agreement with B2Gold Corp. (BTO:TSX) with regards to our exploration tenements at Mupane.\nDuring April 2018, the Company produced 4,004 ounces of gold which represents its best monthly output since February 2014.

The main contributor to this was production from Tau of 34,898 tonnes at 3.80 grams per tonne.\nGalane Gold CEO, Nick Brodie commented: “The first quarter of 2018 was slightly behind our internal targets due to the failure of the ball mill motor at the beginning of the year. The motor was fixed by the end of March 2018 and we were able to recommence full production in April 2018 with additional Tau ore contributing to the exceptional result.\nThe Galaxy project continues with work progressing on the completion of the detailed engineering of the new plant and mining schedules for both the Princeton and Galaxy ore bodies.
