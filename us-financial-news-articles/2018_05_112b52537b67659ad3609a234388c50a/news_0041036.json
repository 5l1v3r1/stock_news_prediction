Its main purpose is to finance the future cost of keeping Germany’s abandoned coal mines from caving in.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan and Matthias Inverardi; Editing by Tom Sims and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T15:16:40.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
