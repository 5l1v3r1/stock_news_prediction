She has been a leading voice in the expansion of audience targeting including the groundbreaking launch of OpenAP, and has invested in award-winning brand studios that provide powerful storytelling platforms for marketers. Speciale and the entire Turner leadership team have also taken a proactive approach with strengthening user experiences across the portfolio, which has led to stronger ROI for brands, including limited ad formats on TNT and truTV.\n“Digital Remedy has been at the forefront of new media ad advancements since digital’s early days, and I’m pleased to join their Board of Directors,” said Speciale. “As demands heighten for ad tech and media innovation, we need to come together as an industry to develop solutions not additional barriers for marketers.”\nWhat differentiates Speciale from most sales heads is her over two decades of experience working directly with clients on the agency side.
