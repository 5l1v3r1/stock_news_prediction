There had been 25 deaths, but no new infections among healthworkers, Jasarevic told reporters.\nThe WHO is sending 7,540 doses of an experimental vaccine to try to stop the outbreak in its tracks, and 4,300 doses have already arrived in Kinshasa. It will be used to protect health workers and “rings” of contacts around each case.\nThe vaccine supplies will be enough to vaccinate 50 rings of 150 people, the WHO said. Each ring represents the number of people including health workers who may have come into contact with an Ebola patient.\nAs of 15 May, 527 contacts had been identified and were being followed up and monitored.
