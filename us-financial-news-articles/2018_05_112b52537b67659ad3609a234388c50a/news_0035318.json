A separate police investigation is under way which could result in criminal charges.\nPrime Minister Theresa May was criticised for her initial response to the disaster when she did not immediately meet representatives of the local community. Last week she agreed to calls from survivors of the fire to broaden the inquiry panel to represent the diversity of the community.
