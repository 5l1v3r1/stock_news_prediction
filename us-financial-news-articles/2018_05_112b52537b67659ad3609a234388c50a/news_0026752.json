Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports “He reached out and said, ‘Hey, good luck in rookie minicamp.’” Rudolph told reporters after Friday’s practice, the first of three this weekend for rookies and first-year eligible players. “I was really appreciative of that. I just said, ‘Hey, thanks, look forward to meeting you.’ Wasn’t a whole lot [of conversation], but it meant a lot that he reached out.”\nOn KDKA-AM radio last week, Roethlisberger said he was “surprised” the team drafted a quarterback, adding that the move passed up an opportunity to get “football players that can help this team win now.”\n“Nothing against Mason, I think he’s a great football player,” Roethlisberger continued. .”..I just don’t know how backing up or being the third guy — who knows where he’s going to be on the depth chart — helps us win now.”\nRoethlisberger went on to say he “feels bad” for incumbent backups Landry Jones and Joshua Dobbs. He mostly dismissed the idea of mentoring Rudolph, saying with a laugh, “I don’t think I’ll need to, now that he said he doesn’t need me. If he asks me a question, I might just have to point to the playbook.”\nRudolph told reporters after he was drafted that it will be his own job to learn rather than relying on Roethlisberger.\nDec 29, 2016; San Antonio, TX, USA; Oklahoma State Cowboys quarterback Mason Rudolph (2) throws a pass in the first quarter against the Colorado Buffaloes during the 2016 Alamo Bowl at Alamodome. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports On Friday, the Oklahoma State product shook off any suggestion that the two could have a frosty relationship after Roethlisberger’s radio comments.\n“I think the media got it kind of twisted around a little bit,” Rudolph said. “He’s a competitor. He’s a Hall of Fame quarterback. He’s a competitive guy. That’s what I would expect. He’s a longtime starter.\n“I’m sure when we get in this building, in this room, we’re going to be friends, and I’m going to let him do his thing and pick up what I can from him but not bother him.”\nRudolph, 22, had an up-and-down first day that included a few dropped snaps from under center, a bit of a foreign experience for a signal-caller who played almost exclusively from the shotgun in college.\nFormer college teammate and second-round pick James Washington called Rudolph a “perfectionist” and “a strong minded guy,” telling reporters that any doubts or criticism of him will “probably only make him hungrier.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T01:54:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
