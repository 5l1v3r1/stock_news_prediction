It’s going to be a matter of a few months, it will be during the course of 2018.”\nThe bulk of the proceeds will go towards projects in China and the bank will carry out another yuan-denominated bond issue within the next two years, he said.\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, the NDB is seen as the first major achievement of the BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - since they got together in 2009 to press for a bigger say in the global financial order created by Western powers after World War Two.\nIn 2016, it completed the sale of a five-year, 3 billion yuan bond which was the first yuan-denominated green bond sold in mainland China by a multinational financial institution at the time.\nHowever, plans to issue bonds in currencies belonging to its other member countries have been delayed, the NDB’s president, K.V. Kamath, said.\nKamath told Reuters in March last year that the NDB planned to raise up to $500 million via rupee-denominated masala bonds by the second half of 2017.\n“We did not proceed with other issues because we thought it appropriate to get our international credit rating exercise done before we approach the markets,” he said, adding that they expect to receive the rating by July.\n“The moment the rating exercise gets completed we will probably go into the other countries’ markets.” The bank has already received an AAA investment rating in China.\nThe NDB also announced that it had approved six new projects that take its loan portfolio to more than $5.1 billion.\nThe schemes include an environmental protection project being carried out by Brazil’s Petrobras, and a rural road construction and upgrade programme in India.\nIt said the approvals meant that it now finances 21 projects in its member countries.
