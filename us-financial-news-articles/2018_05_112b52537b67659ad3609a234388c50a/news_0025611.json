Human Rights Office’s mandate, gather first-hand information about what happened during the protests and to resume contact with the authorities and others in the country,” Shamdasani said.\nThe U.N. was waiting for the government’s reply, she said at a news briefing.\nShe said the U.N. noted that the Nicaraguan National Assembly had created a truth commission to investigate the deaths and allegations of torture and enforced disappearances during the protests.\n“For its investigations to be credible, the commission must be independent and able to conduct its work in a transparent and impartial manner,” Shamdasani said.\nThe U.S. State Department said on Friday the United States remained deeply concerned about the crisis in Nicaragua and condemned the overnight violence.\n“Those responsible for killings and other human rights abuses and violations must be brought to justice,” it said in a statement.\nIt called on the Nicaraguan government to allow independent international human rights organizations such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to assess the situation in the country.\nReporting by Tom Miles; additional reporting by Eric Walsh in Washington; editing by Andrew Roche and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T01:55:12.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
