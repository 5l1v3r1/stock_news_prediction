She has extensive experience developing strategic narratives around highly complex and controversial issues, including market access, pricing and value.\nDuring her six years at Roche, Dion worked in Pharma Communications and led the development of a widely-adopted pricing communications toolkit and app that helped executives communicate a simple, transparent and empathetic pricing story on the value of medicines.
