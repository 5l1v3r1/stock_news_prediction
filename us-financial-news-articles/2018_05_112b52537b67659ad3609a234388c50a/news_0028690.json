Mazda Motor Corp Chief Executive Officer Masamichi Kogai poses next to the company's logo during a presentation at the 43rd Tokyo Motor Show in Tokyo November 20, 2013. REUTERS/Toru Hanai\nThe company said on Friday that Masamichi Kogai will step down and be replaced by current vice president Akira Marumoto, 60, who now oversees operations in the Americas. The changes are effective June 26 after Mazda’s annual shareholders’ meeting.\nKogai, who became Mazda’s president and CEO in 2013, will be following the footsteps of his two immediate predecessors who also held the top job for five years each. He will still be with the automaker and become its chairman, the company said.\nMazda has had a six-year run of rising vehicle sales. With global annual sales of around 1.6 million vehicles, it is seeking to expand, particularly in North America, its biggest market which accounts for nearly 30 percent of total sales.\nEarlier this year, it announced that it would invest in a new, $1.6 billion plant in the U.S. state of Alabama as a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ).\nBut as one of Japan’s smaller automakers, it faces growing costs to stay competitive in an industry which is being disrupted by new technologies, including self-driving cars and electric vehicles.\nMazda and Toyota are jointly developing affordable electric vehicles, pooling resources to better compete in the race for new car technologies. As part of this partnership announced last year, Toyota has taken a 5 percent stake in its smaller rival.\nLast month, Mazda forecast a 28 percent drop in full-year operating profit, hurt by a stronger yen as well as higher spending.
