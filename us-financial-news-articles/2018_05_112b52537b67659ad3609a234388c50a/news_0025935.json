The dividend will be an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income tax purposes. The ex-dividend date is May 22, 2018.\nEnhanced Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nParkland's enhanced Dividend Reinvestment Plan (\"Enhanced DRIP\") allows shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends to purchase additional Parkland shares from treasury at a 5% per share discount to the daily volume weighted average trading price on the applicable dividend payment date.\nShareholders who wish to enroll in the Enhanced DRIP must do so prior to the May 22, 2018 ex-dividend date to reinvest this month’s dividend in Parkland shares at a discount.\nUse of Funds\nThe Enhanced DRIP allows Parkland to retain amounts that would otherwise be paid to shareholders as dividends in cash, thereby incrementally raising equity capital which may be used by Parkland to, among other things, fund its capital program, fund acquisitions, build new locations and upgrade existing locations: all of which help contribute to Parkland’s growth and ability to execute on its strategy.\nEnrolling\nShareholders who own their shares through a brokerage and who wish to participate in the Enhanced DRIP should ensure they are enrolled by checking their online brokerage portal or by calling their investment advisor.\nShareholders who hold certificates in their own name (registered shareholders) who wish to enroll can find out more from Computershare by calling 1-800-564-6253.\nCopies of the Plan and the enrollment form are also available on Parkland's website at http://www.parkland.ca/en/investors/dividend/ .\nFor investors previously enrolled in the Premium Dividend™ component of Parkland's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, please note this program ended in April 2016 and without further action you are now likely receiving the regular dividend.\nBrokerage entitlement and corporate actions departments are encouraged to ensure that they have properly elected with Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (“CDS”) those shares that should participate in the enhanced Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this news release constitute forward-looking information and statements (collectively, “forward looking statements”).
