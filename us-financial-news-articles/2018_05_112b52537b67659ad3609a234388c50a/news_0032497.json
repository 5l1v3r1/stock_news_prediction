They involve dividing international routes into two categories.\nThe first category will comprise unrestricted routes to destinations in countries with at least a partial open skies agreement with China, such as Australia, Thailand and the United States.\nLong-haul destinations in the second category will be subject to certain restrictions.\nChina defines a long-haul route as one that requires flying over 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) one way.\n“This will be a positive long-term development for Chinese airlines whose international route expansion have been limited by traffic rights access,” said Corrine Png, chief executive of transport research consultancy Crucial Perspective.\nHowever, further liberalization could increase competition and pressure passenger yields, while foreign carriers with higher cost structures and inferior services could lose market share to Chinese airlines, Png said.\nAt present, Air China has priority on routes out of Beijing, but the eased policy will allow China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd ( 600115.SS ) ( 0670.HK ) and China Southern Airlines Co Ltd ( 600029.SS ) ( 1055.HK ) to grow market share from their bases at Beijing’s new Daxing Airport.\nShares in the three main carriers closed higher on Monday, with Air China’s Hong Kong-listed shares rising 2.6 percent, while China Eastern and China Southern both rose 4.7 percent. Privately owned Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd’s ( 603885.SS ) Shanghai-listed shares closed up 7.1.\nReporting by Brenda Goh; Additional Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:52:53.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
