[L8N1PH48U]\nTheir health worsened, while others in the program died.\n“I believe it is my responsibility to hold Jammeh to account,” said Sowe, a former university lecturer in his 60s.\n“I knew that one day the real story would be told.”\nPeople were afraid to criticize the president when he was in power, the victims said, so doctors and patients publicly declared that his medicines were working.\nThe program hampered real HIV/AIDS work in Gambia, which trails behind other African countries in treatment rates, according to the U.N. agency UNAIDS.\nIt also worsened stigma against people with HIV and stripped them of dignity, said survivors. Sometimes Jammeh would rub ointment on their bodies in sessions that were broadcast on television, they told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAfterwards, they lost their jobs and struggled to rent houses since their faces were recognizable, they said.\n“Jammeh must pay for what he has done to us,” said Ceesay.\nThe victims are seeking financial damages for harm suffered and a declaration that their human rights were violated, said Saramba Kandeh, a legal associate at AIDS-Free World.\nJammeh will be tried in absentia and can be represented if he wants, she said.\n“We want to send a clear message that people living with HIV are people like us,” Kandeh told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe Gambia-based Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa and a Gambian attorney are also working on the case.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.
