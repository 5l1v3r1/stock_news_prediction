(\"KPOC\" or the \"Company\") (OTCPINK:KPOC), today announced that it is acquiring multiple significant revenue producing copper mining sites in Chile.\nThe Company will be changing its name to “KPOC Mining, Inc.” to better reflect the public Company’s exit from the organic cosmetics marketplace. The Company will be acquiring the assets in Chile through its majority owned subsidiary, “KPOC Mining Chile, Inc.” KPOC Chile will also oversee all aspects of the day-to-day operations in South America.\nThe Company’s transformation to copper mining is a wise one, says Company President, Theodore Collas. “If you want to mine copper, Chile is the world’s most desirable location. The country is rich in untapped deposits.”\nIn an article on “The World's 20 Largest Copper Mines” (the mines that produce about 40 percent of the world's copper)… 7 of the top 14 mines are all located in Chile.\nhttps://www.thebalance.com/the-world-s-20-largest-copper-mines-2014-2339745\nCopper Investing News says:\n“If one were to ask where the homestead of copper production is located, all fingers would point to Chile. The top copper producer in the world, the country hosts many notable copper miners… “We believe that for copper, Chile is the number-one spot on the planet to explore and develop a copper mine,” says Chilean Metals Chairman Terry Lynch. “The country has a historical track record of being the best spot to explore copper in the world.” (emphasis added)\nChile is the most favorable jurisdiction in South America. It has a long history of strong mining laws and is mining friendly, especially to foreign companies. https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/base-metals-investing/copper-investing/copper-mining-chile-top-producer/\nCompany President, Theodore Collas said: “We have wonderful relationships with the key players in the industry, both public & private. Now that we have fully evolved into a copper mining company, Management will be continually providing more details and updates on a regular basis.”\nAbout KCOP Mining USA, Inc.\nKPOC Mining has entered into agreements to purchase 23 copper mining sites in the Republic of Chile. Our geologists have determined that each of mining properties will be highly commercially productive. We believe that development of the first mining site will commence in the first half of 2018, and the remaining sites will be developed over a three- year period. All mining operations will be conducted by KPOC Mining Chile, our Chilean subsidiary.\nIf you have specific questions about the Company, please email us at admin@kpocmining.com &/or visit our website at https://www.kpocmining.com .\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
