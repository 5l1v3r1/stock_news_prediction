This is apparently tied to the U.S. easing restrictions on high-tech exports to China.\nIn China, both the CSI300 and Shanghai Composite indices ended Monday’s trading up, by 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. The news proved particularly buoyant for transport companies, such as Cosco Shipping, which ended the day up by 5.5%.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index gains took that benchmark to its highest levels in two months. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose by 1.3% at one point, but fell to a 0.6% gain at trading’s close, reportedly due to concerns over the strength of the U.S. dollar and higher U.S. interest rates.\nThe dollar gained around 0.3% on the news of the trade war pause. U.S. futures were up too—S&P by 0.6%, Nasdaq by 0.7% and the Dow by 0.9%—while the Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.3% on Monday morning.\n“With tensions between China and the US now in at least temporary abeyance, markets should react positively to a situation which had threatened to derail the synchronised global economic recovery,” Richard Hunter of Interactive Investor told the Financial Times", "external_links": ["https://www.ft.com/content/e8a11432-5c84-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68", "http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2147006/chinese-stocks-rise-5-week-high-mnuchin-says-trade-war", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143"], "published": "2018-05-21T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:46:47.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
