REUTERS/Toby Melville//File Photo\nMore than 50 Reuters editors, producers and reporters from Botswana to Brixton coordinated text, photographs, video and interactive graphics to deliver comprehensive coverage of the latest union in the British royal family.\nGone are the days of the telegram report, but new technologies bring their own challenge to delivering fast and accurate news. For example, getting a cell signal amid the throngs of well-wishers on the wedding day meant that the Reuters broadcast operations team needed a creative connectivity solution to cover the festivities. They used a combination of local WiFi, satellite uplink and a 4G broadband cellular network to ensure images were filed quickly.\nIn this podcast, Jamillah Knowles, a Reuters social media editor, looks at how the world’s largest news organization curated real-time updates from Windsor as well as highlight moments on all media platforms, ensuring that iconic images of the royal couple were seen around the globe. She interviewed U.K. bureau chief Guy Faulconbridge, who talks about coverage of previous royal weddings and what we learned from the experience.
