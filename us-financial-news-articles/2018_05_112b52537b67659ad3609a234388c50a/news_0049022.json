FILE PHOTO: Britain Soccer Football - Swansea City v Manchester City - Barclays Premier League - Liberty Stadium - 15/5/16 Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini Action Images via Reuters / Peter Cziborra Livepic\nThe 64-year-old Chilean left Chinese Super League outfit Hebei China Fortune on Saturday and replaces David Moyes, who left the club last week after guiding them to a 13th-placed finish in the league.\n\"I am excited about this project... West Ham had a difficult season and I hope next season we are going to play football that will delight the fans,\" Pellegrini told West Ham's website here\n“I know that this league is very good and it’s not easy to do it, but I think that working together with the owners, the technical staff and the fans, we have an important power and can think about reaching important targets.”\nWest Ham joint-chairman David Sullivan said in a statement here that the club was looking forward to working with one of the \"most respected\" coaches in the world.\n“It was important that we appointed someone with knowledge and experience of the Premier League, who already has an understanding... of West Ham United and our ambitions.”\nFormer Villarreal, Real Madrid and Malaga boss Pellegrini returns to England two years after leaving City, who he led to the Premier League title and a League Cup triumph in 2014.\nSullivan said the appointment was made bearing in mind the demands of supporters for attacking football. Under Pellegrini, City scored an English record 151 goals in all competitions in his debut campaign in 2013-14.\n“Manuel brings a reputation for attacking football and getting the best out of his players,” Sullivan added. “We believe he will attract new talent to the London Stadium as well as improving the current squad.”\nPellegrini led City to another League Cup triumph in 2016 before making way for current boss Pep Guardiola.\nOne of Pellegrini’s challenges at West Ham will be to deliver the sort of football that will keep fans happy at London Stadium, the club’s unpopular home since they left Upton Park in 2016.\nFans have become increasingly disenchanted with the club’s main owners, Sullivan and David Gold, this season and protested at some home games.\nThings reached a head in March when some supporters invaded the pitch during the 3-0 home defeat by Burnley.
