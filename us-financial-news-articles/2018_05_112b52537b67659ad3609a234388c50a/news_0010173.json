REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo\nIn the latest in a series of startling interviews, tweets and videos, West, 40, also revealed he had undergone liposuction some years ago because he did not want to be called fat.\nThe Grammy Award-winning musician’s most controversial comments came in a rambling video interview at the Southern California offices of celebrity website TMZ.com.\nWest emerged from a year’s silence on Twitter two weeks ago to post up to 20 tweets an hour on topics ranging from politics, to philosophy and fashion.\nAt one point in the TMZ interview, shown on its website, West says, “When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.”\nAmid a social media outcry, West later said on Twitter, “Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will. My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved.”\nThe civil rights group NAACP said in a Twitter response addressed to West, “There is a lot of misinformation out there and we are happy to provide insight. Black people have fought against slavery since we first landed on this continent.” FILE PHOTO: Rapper Kanye West arrives at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards in New York, NY, U.S., August 28, 2016.

I was addicted to opioids.”\nHe said he was given painkillers after undergoing previously unreported liposuction surgery, adding, “I got liposuction, because I didn’t want y’all to call me fat.”\nIn separate video released on Tuesday to match his new single “Ye vs. the People,” West discussed the support he voiced for Trump last week, which caused controversy among many of his fans.\nAsked what he admired about Trump, West told fellow rapper T.I., “the ability to do what no one said you can do, to do the impossible.” FILE PHOTO: Recording artist Kanye West performs during the closing ceremony for the 2015 Pan Am Games at Pan Am Ceremonies Venue in Toronto, Canada, July 26, 2015.
