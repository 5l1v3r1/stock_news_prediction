Her work with top domestic and international brands in Colombia adds considerable value and rigor to Weber Shandwick's Bogotá operations.\n\"We are thrilled to have Paula Restrepo leading our Bogotá office,\" Schoen said. \"Her experience on both the agency and brand sides, coupled with her deep understanding of the Colombian market, make her the perfect choice to lead and grow this office, and deliver for our clients in the region.\"\n\"There is new energy in Colombia and Bogotá is an increasingly sought-after entrance point for both emerging and mature brands to expand into Latin America,\" Restrepo said. \"At the same time, organizations are navigating new challenges in terms of how customers behave and engage with brands. Our mission in Bogota is to be a strategic partner to organizations as we work together to address their greatest communications and marketing needs.
