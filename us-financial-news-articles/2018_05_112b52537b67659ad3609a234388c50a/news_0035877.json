Drilling activity petered out in the early 2000s, although seismic studies have continued.\nPortugal’s Galp and its partner at the time, Brazil’s Petrobras, won an exploration licence in 2007 for three blocks in the Alentejo basin. ENI bought Petrobras’ share in the blocks in 2014.\nThe consortium hopes to drill the well in the last quarter of 2018 after the government last January extended the exploration period for a year.\nThe Expresso newspaper said last month an internal study by the consortium pointed to potential oil reserves of up to 1.5 billion barrels in the area, but the companies would not publicly confirm such estimates, saying only they expected to find hydrocarbons based on seismic studies.\nClimate Action Network (CAN) Europe last month named Portugal the winner of its 2018 European Fossil Fuel Subsidies anti-award for handing out the drilling licence near its protected biodiversity area and a tourism hotspot and wasting taxpayers’ money on supporting dirty energy.\nReporting by Andrei Khalip; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:08:52.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
