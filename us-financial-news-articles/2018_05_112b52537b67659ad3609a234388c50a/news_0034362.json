Data is going to be important in the near term.”\nGerman economic growth slowed slightly more than expected in the first quarter of the year due to weak trade but analysts called it a blip and predicted Europe’s biggest economy would shift into a higher gear again.\nA survey showed that the mood among German investors remained unchanged at its lowest level in five and a half years in May, reflecting persisting concerns that Europe’s biggest economy could be hit be a trade dispute with the United States.\nThe euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.1919, but remained below Monday’s high of $1.1996, which was the common currency’s highest level since May 3.\nThe dollar’s index rose 0.2 percent to 92.764, pulling up from 92.243 on Monday, which was its lowest level since May 2.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield increased two basis points to about 3.019 percent, after rising two basis points on Monday, helping support the greenback.\nThe benchmark yield was supported by signs of an easing in trade tensions between the United States and China after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to help Chinese telecoms firm ZTE Corp, which has been penalised for violating U.S. sanctions with Iran.\nThe Norwegian crown rose 0.3 percent versus the euro to 9.56 crowns after strong quarterly economic data raised expectations of a rate rise later this year. It later gave up most of those gains.\nThe ailing Turkish lira fell to a fresh record low of 4.3990 against the dollar, bringing its losses this year to more than 13 percent after President Tayyip Erdogan said he plans to take greater control of the economy.\nArgentina’s peso plunged to a new record low despite hefty central bank interventions in the past few days and policy makers jacking rates higher in an attempt to stop the peso’s slide.\n“U.S. interest rates have stayed firm at the start of the week and the focal point for investors is increasingly switching to EM (emerging markets),” ING analysts said in a note.\n“Here the two most exposed G20 countries to higher external borrowing costs, Argentina and Turkey, remain under pressure.” (Editing by Alison Williams, Editing by William Maclean)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-05-15T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:29:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
