I was more relaxed in the second but the third was tough again and I was lucky that I got the break,” Kvitova said in a courtside interview.\nSo what does she think of her winning streak that has earned her back-to-back claycourt titles in Prague and Madrid in the run up to Roland Garros?\n“It might be 12 matches but it’s so far from Rafa,” summed up a grinning Kvitova as she acknowledged the feat of 10-times Roland Garros champion Rafael Nadal.
