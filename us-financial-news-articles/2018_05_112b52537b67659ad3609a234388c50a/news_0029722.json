(NASDAQ:NTWK), a global business services and enterprise application solutions provider, reported results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOperational Highlights\nReported quarterly cost savings of $1.8 million mostly tied to cost rationalization initiatives, bringing total savings to $6.2 million and with an anticipated reduction of at least $7.0 million through fiscal 2018.\nSigned a contract with a top tier multi-finance company in Indonesia to implement NFS Ascent’s suite of digital apps valued at approximately $3.0 million.\nGenerated close to $2.0 million through successful implementation of change requests from various customers with expected year-over-year growth of up to 15% in this area thanks to increasing customer demand for greater complexity and customization.\nSold additional legacy licenses valued at $1.0 million to a current Chinese customer due to the increase in its business.\nReceived “Auto Finance Software System Leading Enterprise Award,” which acknowledges the top software solutions company within the auto finance sector in China.\nFiscal Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $17.0 million, compared with $17.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease in total net revenues was primarily due to lower license fees of $3.1 million, which was offset by an increase in services revenue of $2.0 million.\nTotal license fees were $2.6 million, compared with $5.7 million in the prior year period. Total maintenance fees were $3.8 million, compared with $3.6 million in the prior year period. Total services revenues were $10.6 million, compared with $8.6 million in the prior year period.\nGross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $9.2 million (or 53.9% of net revenues), compared to $9.0 million (or 50.1% of net revenues) in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in cost of revenues for the quarter. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and consultants, travel and depreciation.\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 10% to $6.4 million (or 37.8% of net revenues) from $7.2 million (or 39.9% of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in selling and marketing expenses, professional services, general and administrative expenses and depreciation.\nGAAP net income attributable to NETSOL for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $2.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share, an improvement from net income of $700,000 or $0.06 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $4.3 million or $0.39 per diluted share, an improvement from $2.0 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (see note regarding “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure).\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $12.7 million, an increase from $10.0 million at the end of the prior quarter.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn February 27, 2018, NETSOL’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized potential repurchases of up to 500,000 shares of its common stock through June 30, 2018. Under the program, the company may repurchase its common stock in the open market from time-to-time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and federal and state laws governing such transactions. NETSOL expects to fund the repurchase with its existing cash balance and cash generated from operations. During the quarter, the company has repurchased 31,799 shares of its common stock at an aggregate value of $149,694.\nManagement Commentary\n\"In the fiscal third quarter, we continued to improve our bottom line results and generated a solid amount of business through new wins as well as increased customization requests from longstanding customers,\" said NETSOL Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Najeeb Ghauri. “While we are working diligently to advance some of the more significant deals within our expanded pipeline, we were still able to produce our second consecutive quarter of profitability thanks greatly to the outperformance of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, which we are now projecting to result in at least $7 million of savings in fiscal 2018 alone. These initiatives have not only optimized our cost structure, but also created more headroom and capability to scale our business, which we believe can support a significant more amount of revenue without requiring meaningful incremental investment to support it.\n“As we close out the balance of the fiscal year, we are increasingly motivated to capitalize on the greater opportunities in front of us despite the extended sales cycles our industry now faces. In the meantime, we will continue to devote the rest of our efforts to the areas where we have ability to directly impact and control our results. The renewal of our stock repurchase program is one such example that also reflects the sustained confidence and belief our leadership has in NETSOL’s future. In all, our focus remains, as ever, on generating long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders.”\nSales Outlook\n“NETSOL continues to receive new RFP’s and is tracking several promising opportunities, which we expect to ultimately result in positive outcomes,” added President and Head of Sales Naeem Ghauri. “The Ascent platform has garnered strong traction, mainly with the tier one auto and asset captive finance companies in our major APAC markets. With more intelligence, sophistication and automation into the front office along with its unique toolset in the back office, Ascent remains the superior choice in its field. Moving forward, our pipeline remains very healthy, and we are looking forward to capitalizing on the more mature sales opportunities that will be reaching the finishing line in the near future.”\nConference Call\nNETSOL Technologies management will hold a conference call today (May 14, 2018) at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time (6:00 a.m. Pacific time) to discuss these financial results.
