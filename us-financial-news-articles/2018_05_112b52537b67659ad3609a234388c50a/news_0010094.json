At the time, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said the platform had refused to shut down channels used for peaceful protests—Telegram channels are public groups, separate from the encrypted-functionality that the app also provides.\nTelegram is hugely popular in Iran. According to Al Arabiya , 40 million people there—around half the population—use it.\nBoth President Hassan Rouhani and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, announced in April that they would no longer use the platform. Khamenei did so while urging followers of his Telegram channel to instead use homegrown platforms such as Soroush and Gap.\nIt remains to be seen how well the ban will work in practice. As in Iran, Russian authorities have also ordered Internet service providers to block access to Telegram , but it reportedly still works there.\nIndeed, the Russian Telegram ban—which stems from Telegram’s refusal to hand over the keys to users’ encrypted conversations—has proved to be a debacle.\nIn order to keep Telegram up and running in the country, the app’s developers moved its backend infrastructure over to a series of cloud platforms, such as those run by Amazon and Google . The Russian telecommunications regulator, Roskomnadzor, responded by adding millions of those cloud platforms’ IP addresses to its blacklist , taking out bystander web services that also rely on the platforms.\nThank you, each and one of the 12,000+ people who stood up to support the freedom of internet and Telegram today in central Moscow. You make me proud and excited to be Russian. https://t.co/1Vwa1FQgIO\n— Pavel Durov (@durov) April 30, 2018\nDurov, a veteran entrepreneur who these days lives outside Russia, is organizing protests against the ban.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T11:15:12.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
