Photo: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg\nThis is a weekly commentary by external experts.\nPaints and coatings maker PPG Industries Inc. launched an internal investigation in April into accounting irregularities, delayed the filing of its quarterly earnings report for the period ended March 31 and fired its controller, Mark Kelly. The company said earlier this month it had evidence that some of its employees had made improper accounting entries at the direction of the company’s now-former controller. As a result, PPG said its financial reports for 2017 “should no longer be relied upon.”\nPPG announced its internal investigation in its April 19 earnings report , then issued a statement on May 10 outlining the steps its taken after receiving information through its internal reporting system about the irregularities. PPG said the audit committee of its board is leading an investigation that involves assistance from outside counsel. “The investigation has found evidence that the improper accounting entries were made by certain employees at the direction of the Company’s former vice president and controller,” the company said. PPG also shared with WSJ two letters sent internally to its employees.\nThree crisis-management experts review the company’s communications.\nGrace Keith, managing director, Caliber Corporate Advisers: “In any moment of crisis it’s imperative that a company clearly state was has occurred, what is being done to address the issue and provide a timeline of when to expect further updates. From this angle PPG did effectively issue a statement along these lines with important details about the steps currently being taken, including notifying the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as firing the former controller.\n“PPG also made sure to focus on the steps being taken in multiple communications, including internal memos as well as public-facing statements. By highlighting not just the internal changes taking place due to this issue, but also the external counsel being brought in to conduct a full review, PPG has followed the right steps in this initial period.\n“By reiterating the company’s ethical standards and making internal ethics reporting contact information within its internal memos, PPG continued to showcase its focus on ensuring issues like this were raised appropriately. Ensuring that the process to raise concerns–either from within or outside of the company–is clear and continuously reiterated is the key to nurturing and protecting ethical standards.”\nBill Coletti, chief executive, Kith: “The nature of the response by any public company finding itself in a situation such as this is rather formulaic, driven by SEC and accounting requirements as well as a clear articulation of company values. On its face, the situation facing PPG is not dire; the numbers involved here are not large relative to its earnings or market cap, the street reaction is rather subdued and share price has nearly recovered.\n“The initial company message and subsequent CEO memos to employees strikes the correct balance between contrition, problem-solving and statement of values. What is unclear right now–and until the investigation is concluded and the company files an update with the SEC–is why the controller directed these moves, whether there are any deeper problems, whether the independent auditor was or should have been aware, and who in the chain of command was aware?\n“If systemic anomalies are determined, the nature of PPGs message will need to change. Going forward, PPG would do well by addressing this with the seriousness that it deserves but not allow it be a distraction. Thus far they have done that and need to continue.”\nAdele Cehrs, chief executive, Epic Real Time Marketing: “Based on initial evidence PPG should have fired Mr. Kelly immediately in late April. His discrepancy was either fraudulent or incompetent behavior, [both of] which are fireable offenses. By placing him on leave PPG seemed to be jeopardizing the company’s values and reputation.\n“PPG needed to be more decisive in its termination of a key employee; as a result of its hesitancy, the company put its reputation and financial stability at risk. By saying its financial statements “should no longer be relied upon,” PPG’s actions made them seem like they were unfit to manage the crisis.\n“While the company’s response to its employees was effective at taking some responsibility, the approach appeared more like an excuse rather than an effort to take accountability. There was a textbook crisis communication misstep with this phrasing: ‘We hold ourselves to a very high standard of business and professional conduct…’ The situation proves otherwise.”\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@wsj.com , and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.\nShare this: crisis of the week PPG Industries Inc.
