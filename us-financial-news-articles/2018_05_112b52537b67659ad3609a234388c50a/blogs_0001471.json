DeMille Award, January 8, 2018.\nSo, how has Williams fared with following the billionaire media mogul's advice?\n\"When she said that it really was like a seed that started to grow. And, I think as time has gone by, I've been able to live up to that advice more and more…\" he says.\n\"Obviously, I still have a long ways to go, but I feel like I'm doing a much better job than I was then.\"\nWilliams, who retired from football in 2011, says he's definitely become more comfortable being himself in public settings, as he's now a far more open and willing participant in media interviews. In fact, he's now technically a part of the media himself, working occasionally as an analyst with ESPN. Williams also appeared as a contestant on NBC's \"The New Celebrity Apprentice\" for last year's season hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger (Williams was \"terminated\" in the show's fifth episode). show chapters 10:44 AM ET Tue, 27 March 2018 | 01:00\nMeanwhile, Williams' own words today clearly mirror Winfrey's early advice when the former NFL star talks about walking away from the game that made him famous.\nWilliams tells CNBC Make It that, after he briefly retired for one year in the middle of his playing career, \"the story was 'football player retires to go smoke pot.'\" However, he adds: \"Part of that was true, but it was much bigger than that. I was really redefining myself and figuring out what I want to do with my life....\"\nWilliams eventually realized, \"I wasn't just a football player and that there was more to me,\" he says.\nWilliams has spent much of his post-NFL life studying everything from psychology (he earned his undergraduate degree from UT two years ago) to herbalism and holistic medicine . And, over the past few years, he's also become an outspoken advocate for legal cannabis and was actively looking for investment opportunities in the rapidly growing marijuana industry.\nIn March, Williams launched his own brand of cannabis-based products, called Real Wellness.\nNow, says Williams, \"I'm a healer.\"\nDon't miss: ", "external_links": ["https://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/18/8102386/hello-miami-ricky-williams-is-tickled-to-be-a-dolphinand-eager-to-prove-new-orleans-fans-are-wrong", "https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/07/13/ricky-williams-future-plans-marijuana-industry", "https://espnmediazone.com/us/bios/ricky-williams/", "https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/15/marijuana-a-75-billion-market-by-2030.aspx", "https://adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/personal-stories/ricky-williams-story-social-anxiety-disorder", "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ricky-williams-launches-cannabis-based-wellness-brand-300616424.html", "https://www.si.com/vault/2000/03/20/276809/ricky-williams-new-orleans-saints-rookie-year", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/the-nfls-most-notorious-underachiever-wants-a-doctorate-in-p?utm_term=.ya57xaaY5#.myGzAZZXM", "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/sports/football/22williams.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=3ECC70A6F0FDC41FC2387D3F22ABE2B3&gwt=pay", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/ravens/bs-sp-ravens-ricky-williams-0120-20120119-story.html", "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ricky-williams-explains-his-belief-that-cannabis-can-help-nfl-players/"], "published": "2018-05-02T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T18:56:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
