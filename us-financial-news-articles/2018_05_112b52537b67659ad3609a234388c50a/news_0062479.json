The approximately 5,300-square-foot main house has 10 bedrooms and five bathrooms. Expanded by the Witters, it has changed little over the years. “You walk into the house and there’s a sense of being whisked away back in time,” said Brooks Witter, Mr. Witter’s great-grandson.\nThe property includes timber and cattle operations as well as approximately 16½ miles of the Eel River. The roughly 800 cow-calf pairs are for sale separately, along with the equipment. There are also four other homes, two bunkhouses, barns, sheds and corrals. The area is home to elk, blacktail deer, pig, bear and quail.\nMore from Mansion\nAOL’s Steve Case Sells Estate to Saudi Government For $43 Million May 30, 2018 Northern California Ranch of the Late Dean Witter Asks $31 Million May 30, 2018 Ben Affleck Lists Private Georgia Compound for $8.9 Million May 30, 2018 Mr. Witter and his wife, Helen, assembled the ranch from three separate purchases in 1942.
