Itau BBA is Latin America’s largest wholesale and investment bank.\nBrazil’s Central Bank made a surprise decision late on Wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged, confounding expectations of a rate cut, but that will have a very small impact on economic activity, Fernandes said.\nThis week, Reuters reported that Brazilian banks were seeing weak corporate demand. Its top four listed banks - Itaú, Banco do Brasil SA, Santander Brasil SA e Banco Bradesco SA - reported a 6.6 percent overall first-quarter year-over-year drop in large corporate lending to 602.8 billion reais ($163.29 billion).\nFernandes, speaking by phone from New York after a two-day Itaú BBA conference there with investors in Latin American stocks and bonds, said concern about Brazil’s presidential election - where market-friendly candidates have been lagging in recent polls - is making investors more selective when picking Brazilian assets.
