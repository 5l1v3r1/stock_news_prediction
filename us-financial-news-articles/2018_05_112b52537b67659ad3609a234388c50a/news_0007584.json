On a U.S. GAAP (\"GAAP\") basis, first quarter 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.22. This figure compares with first quarter of 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.11.\nGAAP operating income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $37 million, which exceeded the guidance range of $30 million to $35 million previously provided by the Company.\n“We are pleased to report strong first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations,” said President and CEO Nick Grasberger. “Harsco executed well in the quarter and a strengthening global economy has become more apparent in recent months. This momentum supports a boost to our 2018 outlook and a more meaningful increase in our key performance measures relative to last year.”\n“The initiation of a share repurchase program is another indication of our progress. We have consistently met or exceeded expectations over the past few years and the underlying stability within our businesses has strengthened considerably. The buyback decision reflects our business confidence as well as our financial flexibility. Looking ahead, we are focused on executing against our growth priorities. We are confident these investments will support further earnings growth for Harsco and create additional value for shareholders.”\nHarsco Corporation—Selected First Quarter Results\n($ in millions, except per share amounts) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 (1) Revenues $ 408 $ 373 Operating income from continuing operations - GAAP $ 37 $ 29 Operating margin from continuing operations - GAAP 9.0 % 7.7 % Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 0.22 $ 0.11 Return on invested capital (TTM) - excluding unusual items 12.5 % 8.2 % (1) 2017 figures reflect new pension accounting standard\nConsolidated First Quarter Operating Results\nTotal revenues were $408 million, an increase of 10 percent compared with the prior-year quarter as a result of higher revenues in the Company's Metals & Minerals and Industrial segments. The first quarter of 2018 included revenues of approximately $8 million related to the Company's multi-year contracts with SBB, or the federal railway system in Switzerland.\nGAAP operating income from continuing operations was $37 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP operating income of $29 million in the same quarter of last year. Operating income in the Metals & Minerals and Industrial segments improved in comparison with the prior-year quarter, while operating income declined as expected in the Rail segment. Also, Corporate spending decreased relative to the prior-year period, contributing to the year-on-year increase in operating income.\nThe Company's operating margin increased to 9.0 percent versus an operating margin of 7.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter Business Review\nMetals & Minerals\n($ in millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 (1) %Change Revenues $ 265 $ 247 7 % Operating income - GAAP $ 28 $ 26 8 % Operating margin - GAAP 10.5 % 10.4 % Customer liquid steel tons (millions) 37.5 36.8 2 % (1) 2017 figures reflect new pension accounting standard Revenues increased 7 percent to $265 million, as a result of higher steel output and service levels as well as foreign exchange translation. Meanwhile, operating income in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $28 million compared with operating income of $26 million in the prior-year period. The improvement in operating earnings is attributable to the above items, which were partially offset by higher general and administrative costs to support the Company's growth strategy. Lastly, the segment's operating margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 10.5 percent, or slightly better than the same quarter of 2017.\nIndustrial\n($ in millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 (1) %Change Revenues $ 84 $ 66 27 % Operating income - GAAP $ 12 $ 3 nmf Operating margin - GAAP 14.9 % 4.4 % (1) 2017 figures reflect new pension accounting standard nmf=not meaningful Revenues increased 27 percent to $84 million, due to increased demand within each of the Industrial product businesses. Meanwhile, operating income increased to $12 million from $3 million and the segment's operating margin increased to 14.9 percent from 4.4 percent in the comparable quarter last year. These changes are attributable to improved demand, manufacturing improvements and a more favorable sales mix.\nRail\n($ in millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 (1) %Change Revenues $ 60 $ 60 — % Operating income - GAAP $ 2 $ 6 (69 )% Operating margin - GAAP 3.3 % 10.4 % (1) 2017 figures reflect new pension accounting standard Revenues totaled $60 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year quarter. The first quarter of 2018 included revenues of approximately $8 million from SBB. Meanwhile, operating income totaled $2 million compared with $6 million in the prior-year quarter. Lower equipment and contract services contributions, which were anticipated, partially offset by an improved after-market parts mix led to the change in operating income. As a result, the segment's operating margin was 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018.\nCash Flow\nNet cash used by operating activities totaled $8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $6 million in the prior-year period. Further, free cash flow was $(35) million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $(22) million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year change in free cash flow reflects an increase in capital expenditures, including for growth, and a modest decrease in net cash from operating activities.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company's 2018 guidance is increased to reflect revised forecasts for the Metals & Minerals and Industrial segments as compared with the guidance provided along with the Company's fourth quarter 2017 results. For Metals & Minerals, adjusted operating income is expected to increase more than previously anticipated due to higher mill services demand and commodity prices. As a result, higher customer steel output and commodity prices, new contract ramp-ups, operational savings and improved profitability in certain Applied Products businesses are expected to be only partially offset by exited sites and investments to support growth initiatives for the year. Meanwhile, the Industrial outlook is improved to reflect better demand for each of its product businesses. This fact, along with a more favorable product mix and manufacturing savings, are now expected to support a larger year-on-year increase in operating income compared with prior guidance.\nThe outlook for the Rail segment and Corporate are mostly unchanged. In Rail, adjusted operating income is anticipated to be modestly higher compared with 2017, as increased demand for after-market parts and Protran Technology products will be partially offset by a less favorable mix of equipment sales and lower contributions from contracting services. Also, Corporate spending is expected to be modestly higher than 2017 due to personnel investments and professional fees.\nLastly, note that this outlook and comparisons with the prior year are now updated to reflect the application of the new pension classification standard for both 2017 and 2018. The related impact to the Company's segment reporting for each of the 2017 quarters is included later in this press release.\nKey highlights in the Outlook are included below.\nFull Year 2018\nGAAP and adjusted operating income for the full year is expected to range from $165 million to $180 million; versus $150 million to $170 million previously and compared with 2017 GAAP operating income of $145 million and 2017 adjusted operating income of $150 million. GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year are expected in the range of $1.11 to $1.24; versus $0.97 to $1.14 previously and compared with 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.09 and 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.74. Free cash flow is expected in the range of $85 million to $100 million, versus $80 million to $100 million previously and compared with $93 million in 2017. Also, the free cash flow outlook anticipates net capital expenditures of between $125 million and $145 million and growth-oriented capital spending of $45 million to $50 million in 2018. Net interest expense is forecasted to range from $34 million to $36 million; compared with $45 million\nin 2017. The effective tax rate is expected to range from 26 percent to 28 percent. Adjusted return on invested capital is expected to range from 14.0 percent to 15.5 percent; compared with 11.5 percent in 2017.\nQ2 2018\nGAAP and adjusted operating income of $45 million to $50 million; compared with GAAP and adjusted operating income of $43 million in the prior-year quarter. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.30 to $0.35; compared with GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $0.22 in the prior-year quarter.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its results and respond to questions from the investment community.

This measure should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nHARSCO CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF FREE CASH FLOW TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES (Unaudited)\nProjected\nTwelve Months Ending\nDecember 31 2018 (In millions) Low High Net cash provided by operating activities $ 210 $ 245 Less capital expenditures (130 ) (149 ) Plus total proceeds from asset sales and capital expenditures for strategic ventures 5 4 Free Cash Flow $ 85 $ 100 The Company's management believes that free cash flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations less capital expenditures net of asset sales proceeds for planning and performance evaluation purposes.

The Company uses a trailing twelve month average for computing average capital. Unusual items are tax effected at the global effective tax rate, before discrete items, in effect at the time the unusual item is recorded except for unusual items from countries where no tax benefit can be realized, in which case a zero percent tax rate is used. The Company’s effective tax rate approximated 37% for the trailing twelve months for period ended March 31, 2017 and for the trailing twelve months for period ended March 31, 2018, 37% was used for April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and 23% was used for January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2018, on an adjusted basis, for interest expense.\nThe Company’s management believes Return on invested capital excluding unusual items, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is meaningful in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital invested in the Company’s business. Exclusion of unusual items permits evaluation and comparison of results for the Company’s core business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses the Company’s performance.

Employers are required to report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. Other components of net periodic pension cost (\"NPPC\") are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of the subtotal of income from operations.\nThe Company’s management believes Adjusted operating income (loss) excluding unusual items, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is useful to investors because it provides an overall understanding of the Company’s historical and future prospects. Exclusion of unusual items permits evaluation and comparison of results for the Company’s core business operations, and it is on this basis that management internally assesses the Company’s performance. This measure should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nInvestor Contact Media Contact David Martin Jay Cooney 717.612.5628 717.730.3683 damartin@harsco.com jcooney@harsco.com\nSource:Harsco Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/00aa6ddb-bd27-40c7-821d-04959f5331b5"], "published": "2018-05-02T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:53:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
