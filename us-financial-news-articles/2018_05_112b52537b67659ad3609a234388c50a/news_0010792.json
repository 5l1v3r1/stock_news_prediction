Analysts believe rural Malaysians will vote over issues like rising costs and unemployment.\nThe prime minister also arrived in Pahang on Thursday, where he opened a new university campus. He asked voters to choose the government wisely.\n“We must favour those who provide us with the benefits,” Najib said, according to state news agency Bernama.\n“We can elect anyone but the most important consideration is whether the chosen ones can provide us with a better life or otherwise,” he said.\nIn the lead up to the polls, Najib has given cash handouts, debt waivers and also promised more benefits if his party is returned to power.\nMahathir told the group at the Felda settlement that the scandal affects all Malaysians.\n“1MDB had a starting capital of 1 million ringgit, and then he went and borrowed 42 billion ringgit. Imagine that, you only have a starting capital of 1 million ringgit and you can borrow 42 billion ringgit,” Mahathir told the planters at the event.\nHe asked them to go out and vote to ensure the opposition wins by the tens of thousands.
