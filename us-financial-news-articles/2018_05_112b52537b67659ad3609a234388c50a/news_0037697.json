(NASDAQ:AMRH) (“Ameri100” or the “Company”), a specialized SAP® cloud, digital and enterprise services company, today reported its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. First Quarter 2017\nRevenue of $11.1 million compared to $12.3 million; Gross profit of $2.3 million compared to $3.3 million; Gross margin of 21.2% compared to 26.8%; GAAP net (loss) of $(2.1) million compared to $(1.2) million; (Loss) per share of $(0.11) compared to $(0.09); and Adjusted EBITDA was $(0.1) million compared to $ 0.8 million.\n“We made considerable progress in the first quarter towards returning to adjusted EBITDA profitability in the first-half of 2018 as cost reductions and productivity improvements narrowed Adjusted EBITDA loss by approximately $600,000 from fourth quarter 2017 to first quarter 2018,” stated Brent Kelton, Chief Executive Officer of Ameri100. “As expected, revenue and profitability declined for the quarter as compared to the year-ago period, which included a large project that was completed last year and overshadowed new projects brought in during the first quarter of this year. These new projects demonstrate execution on our strategy to drive higher-margin solution sales and our ability to deepen the penetration of our clients’ IT budgets and gain new clients for our cloud services. Overall, we are seeing strong market receptivity to our service offerings portfolio which spans the steady-growth enterprise market and high-growth, high-margin digital and cloud markets.\n“With an improving cost structure and the full effect of our costs rationalization initiatives supporting our goal of restoring Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the second quarter, we are turning our attention to driving top-line growth from an SAP services market that is in the early stages of a required migration to SAP S/4HAHA. As one of the few SAP-dedicated consultancies in the marketplace, we are proactively positioning ourselves with enterprises just starting down or are already on their migration paths and building our collaboration with SAP to drive incremental sales. To further embed Ameri100 with SAP, we are planning to exhibit at Sapphire Now, SAP’s annual user conference in June where we will also launch our unified Ameri100 brand. With a broad solutions offering and a focus on high-growth, high demand segments – cloud and digital – coupled with initiatives to broaden awareness of our capabilities and closer alignment with SAP, we are well positioned to secure our long-term success.”\nFinancial Outlook\nAmeri100 reaffirms its prior financial targets for fiscal 2018 of:\nAdjusted EBITDA profitability during the first-half of the year; Year-over-year revenue growth target of 15% and adjusted EBITDA profitability target for the full year.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today, Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET (New York time) to discuss the Company’s results as well as recent corporate developments.

Words such as, but not limited to, \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"targets,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" and similar expressions or phrases identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about Ameri100's financial and growth projections as well as statements concerning our plans, predictions, estimates, strategies, intentions, beliefs and other information concerning our business and the markets in which we operate. The future performance of Ameri100 may be adversely affected by the following risks and uncertainties: the level of market demand for our services, the highly-competitive market for the types of services that we offer, market conditions that could cause our customers to reduce their spending for our services, our ability to create, acquire and build new businesses and to grow our existing businesses, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, currency fluctuations and market conditions around the world, and other risks not specifically mentioned herein but those that are common to industry. For a more detailed discussion of these factors and risks, investors should review Ameri100's reports on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Commission (the “SEC”), which can be accessed through the SEC's website. Forward-looking statements in this press release are based on management's beliefs and opinions at the time the statements are made. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, and Ameri100 undertakes no duty to update this information to reflect future events, information or circumstances.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), information containing non-GAAP financial measures for the Company are disclosed in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers.\nIn this press release, the Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure \"adjusted EBITDA\". Company management uses this non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing information technology services and products, Company management finds it useful to use \"adjusted EBITDA\", which does not include interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, preferred stock dividends, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related expenses and restructuring expenses. While we may have these types of items and charges in the future, Company management believes that they are not reflective of the day- to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, and that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. Company management believes the exclusion of the items described above from \"adjusted EBITDA\" is a very common measure utilized in the investment community and it helps Company management benchmark its operations and results with the industry.\nThe limitation associated with using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these measures exclude items that impact the Company's current period operating results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with \"net income (loss)\", and \"net income (loss) per diluted share\" (the most comparable GAAP measures) because these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher or lower than the most comparable GAAP measure.\nCorporate Contact:\nViraj Patel, Chief Financial Officer\nIR@ameri100.com\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nJody Burfening/Sanjay M.
