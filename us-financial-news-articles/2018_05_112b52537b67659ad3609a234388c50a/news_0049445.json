Spanish police often have to deal with bad behavior by drunken British and other foreign tourists.\nYoung British people get into this kind of work thinking it involves “a few hours where they get a few free drinks, a steady wage and still enjoy the party and go home with a tan and some money,” the government’s report said.\n“This seems to be far from reality: (these) workers are an exploited and vulnerable group of people,” the report said.\nBritish women working as promoters on the island face sexual harassment and abuse, while many workers fall into debt and homelessness, and turn to crime to survive, the government said.\nMore than 80 percent of British prisoners on Mallorca are former bar and club promoters - convicted of crimes such as drug dealing and robbery, according to the government report.\nJustine Currell of the anti-trafficking charity Unseen said modern-day slavery was more widespread than the public realized, and warned of the risks facing young people seeking work abroad.\n“They could end up in a job they did not foresee, living in sub standard accommodation paying huge rents, being forced to commit crimes such as selling drugs or having their passport confiscated,” Currell told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe government is carrying out a week-long operation at airports across Britain to warn young travelers about how to spot the signs of exploitation in Mallorca and report abuses.\n“We want to ensure that those contemplating (this) work in Mallorca, many of whom are tourists tempted by the idea of an extended stay in the sunshine, do not find their summer turning into a nightmare,” said immigration minister Caroline Nokes.\nAbout 25 million people worldwide are estimated to be trapped in forced labor, according to the U.N. International Labor Organization (ILO) and rights group Walk Free Foundation.\nWriting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Claire Cozens.
