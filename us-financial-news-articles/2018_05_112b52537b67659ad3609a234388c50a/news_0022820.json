Reservations on the online lodging marketplace Airbnb soared over 80 percent from the same week of last year to 54,000.\nSlideshow (13 Images) Portugal as a whole, and Lisbon in particular, have enjoyed a tourism boom over the past few years with arrivals spiking 12 percent to a new record last year, contributing to the once-bailed out country’s strongest economic growth since 2000.\nDozens of new hotels and hundreds of apartments for temporary accommodation open every year, while a new cruise ship terminal unveiled in late 2017 doubled the number of arrivals by sea in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier.\nPop star Madonna was last year among a growing number of foreign residents in Portugal, among them movie stars like Monica Belucci and Michael Fassbender.\nIt is the first time Lisbon has hosted a Eurovision contest after Portugal’s Salvador Sobral won last year’s contest in Ukraine’s capital Kiev.\nThis year’s favorites include Cypriot singer Eleni Foureira with a fiery song “Fuego” and Israel’s Netta Barzilai singing “I’m Not Your Toy”, a fast-paced dance mix with a women’s empowerment twist.\nThe event also marks the return of Russia after it boycotted the contest last year amid tensions with Ukraine following Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014. It will be represented by Julia Samoylova who was unable to take part in 2017, singing “I Won’t Break”.\nReporting By Andrei Khalip; Editing by Axel Bugge and Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T20:47:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
