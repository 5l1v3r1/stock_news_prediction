Timeline Should Help You Keep Track of Files and Photos The new Timeline feature is essentially a way for people to better locate specific files, photos, or videos on their PCs.\nPeople can use the service to scroll through a list of their past activities going back to a day or even weeks. Customers will see their activities grouped in hour-long chunks each day, so they can more easily find the emails or files they may have sent during those time periods.\n2. Work Without Distraction The Focus Assist feature is basically an easier way for people to turn off app notifications during specific times during the work day.\n“Much of this time is spent on social media, where the constant stream of distractions across our myriad of devices makes it hard to focus,” Microsoft said in a corporate blog post on the feature. “With this update, we’re introducing Focus Assist to help you stay in the zone.”\n3. Some Nifty Virtual Reality Updates Microsoft said that the new Windows 10 Update would include the availability of its “Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR” feature to more people outside of what’s known as “early access,” intended for people who want to try out the software before it’s ready for the mainstream.\nThe Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR makes it easier for people to play and access virtual reality games from the Steam video game distribution service via their Windows-powered VR headsets .\nMicrosoft said the new Mixed Reality update (Microsoft refers to both virtual and augmented reality as “mixed reality”) allows for better motion controller feedback for users. Additionally, people can hold the Windows button and tap the trigger of a motion controller to more easily take digital photos within their VR games.\n4. Do More Work By Talking The new Dictation service helps people compose digital notes by speaking, with the help of their computer’s built-in microphone.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nFrom Microsoft:\nWith your cursor in any text field either in Windows 10 or in an app, simply press Win + H and start talking. The improved Dictation feature in Windows 10 will capture your thoughts quickly and accurately so that brilliant idea you just riffed on with your colleagues or the speech you’re practicing for your best friend’s wedding isn’t lost forever.\nNot everyone will be able to access the new Dictation service, as Microsoft said it would be available in “select markets” without saying which places. Additionally, Microsoft said that the Dictation “experience may vary by region and device,” implying that it would work better in some places than in others.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143"], "published": "2018-04-30T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T00:33:00.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
