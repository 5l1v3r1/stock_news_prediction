In the case of Adjusted Diluted Weighted Average Shares, Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations is used in determining whether to include such dilutive impact.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nAs anticipated, total revenues decreased by 32 percent to $701 million in first-quarter 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The decline was primarily due to the loss of marketing exclusivity in the first half of 2017 for the first-to-file U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals products ezetimibe tablets, the generic version of ZETIA ® , and quetiapine extended-release (ER) tablets, the generic version of SEROQUEL XR ® , both of which launched in fourth-quarter 2016. Also contributing to the decline in total revenues were the annualization of the impact from 2017 competitive entries and product discontinuances in the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, the divestitures of the Company's South African and Mexican businesses, Litha and Somar, and the voluntary withdrawal of OPANA ® ER.\nGAAP net loss from continuing operations in first-quarter 2018 was $498 million compared to GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $165 million during the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $244 million in pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges in first-quarter 2018. GAAP diluted net loss per share from continuing operations for first-quarter 2018 was $2.23, compared to GAAP diluted net loss per share from continuing operations of $0.74 in first-quarter 2017.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations in first-quarter 2018 was $151 million compared to $275 million in first-quarter 2017. This decrease resulted primarily from lower revenues of ezetimibe tablets and quetiapine ER tablets, the divestitures of Litha and Somar, the voluntary withdrawal of OPANA ® ER and an increase of $12 million in net interest expense. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in first-quarter 2018 was $0.67 compared to $1.23 in first-quarter 2017.\nU.S. BRANDED - SPECIALTY & ESTABLISHED PHARMACEUTICALS\nDuring the first-quarter, Endo advanced its cellulite treatment development program. In February, the Company initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (or \"CCH\") for the treatment of cellulite. In April, CCH for the treatment of cellulite was presented during the Hot Topics Symposium, a highlight of The Aesthetics Meeting 2018, the annual meeting of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.\nFirst-quarter 2018 U.S. Branded - Specialty & Established Pharmaceuticals results include:\nRevenues of $200 million, a 20 percent decrease compared to first-quarter 2017; this decrease was primarily attributable to the voluntary cessation of OPANA ® ER shipments in the third-quarter of 2017. Specialty Products revenues increased 7 percent in first-quarter 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven by strong performance from XIAFLEX ® and other products within our Specialty Products portfolio. Sales of XIAFLEX ® increased 15 percent compared to first-quarter 2017; this increase was primarily attributable to volume growth in both Dupuytren's Contracture and Peyronie's Disease.\nU.S. BRANDED - STERILE INJECTABLES\nIn April, Endo announced that it entered into definitive agreements to acquire Somerset Therapeutics, LLC, a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets sterile injectable and ophthalmic drugs for the U.S. marketplace, and the business of its affiliate Wintac Limited, which operates as Somerset Therapeutics' contract developer and manufacturer, for approximately $190 million. Somerset Therapeutics' portfolio includes 8 commercial products and a pipeline of more than 40 products, of which over 25 have been filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In May, the Company launched glycopyrrolate injection, the generic version of ROBINUL ® , as Somerset Therapeutics' exclusive distributor.\nFirst-quarter 2018 U.S. Branded - Sterile Injectables results include:\nRevenues of $216 million, a 25 percent increase compared to first-quarter 2017; this increase was primarily attributable to strong growth of ADRENALIN ® and VASOSTRICT ® .\nU.S. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS\nDuring first-quarter 2018, the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment launched two products and submitted two regulatory filings. In April, the segment launched praziquantel tablets, the first-to-market generic version of BILTRICIDE ® .\nFirst-quarter 2018 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals results include:\nRevenues of $249 million, a 55 percent decrease compared to first-quarter 2017; this decline was primarily attributable to the loss of marketing exclusivity in the first half of 2017 for the first-to-file products ezetimibe tablets and quetiapine ER tablets. Also contributing to the decline was the annualization of the impact from 2017 competitive entries and previously announced product discontinuances.\nINTERNATIONAL PHARMACEUTICALS\nFirst-quarter 2018 International Pharmaceuticals revenues were $35 million, compared to $65 million in the same period in 2017. The decline is primarily attributable to the sales of Litha and Somar in the second-half of 2017.\n2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nFor the full twelve months ending December 31, 2018, at current exchange rates, Endo affirms its previously provided guidance on revenue, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. The Company estimates:\nTotal revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion; Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to be between $2.15 and $2.55; and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.\nThe Company's 2018 non-GAAP financial guidance is based on the following assumptions:\nAdjusted gross margin of approximately 67.0% to 68.0%; Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues of approximately 25.5% to 26.5%; Adjusted interest expense of approximately $530 million to $540 million; Adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 11.0% to 12.0%; and Adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 226 million.\nBALANCE SHEET, LIQUIDITY AND OTHER UPDATES\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $980 million in unrestricted cash; debt of $8.3 billion; net debt of approximately $7.3 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.1.\nFirst-quarter 2018 cash provided by operating activities was $49 million, compared to $168 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the comparable 2017 period. The 2017 period included the impact of cash receipts for ezetimibe tablets and quetiapine ER tablets, which did not reoccur during the 2018 period, and higher payments related to U.S. mesh product liability claims.\nDuring first-quarter 2018, the Company recorded pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of $448 million, $391 million of which related to goodwill and $54 million of which related to other intangible assets.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nEndo will conduct a conference call with financial analysts to discuss this press release today at 7:30 a.m. ET.

These Non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income and its components and diluted earnings per share amounts. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations and its components (unlike GAAP net income from continuing operations and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These Non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. However, the Company does not provide reconciliations of projected non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, nor does it provide comparable projected GAAP financial measures for such projected non-GAAP financial measures. The Company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for asset impairments, contingent consideration adjustments, legal settlements, loss on extinguishment of debt, adjustments to inventory and other charges reflected in the reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which could be significant.\nSee Endo's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished today to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of Endo's non-GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Endo International plc\nEndo International plc (NASDAQ: ENDP) is a highly focused generics and specialty branded pharmaceutical company delivering quality medicines to patients in need through excellence in development, manufacturing and commercialization.

Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Endo's performance at times differs materially from its estimates and targets, and Endo often does not know what the actual results will be until after the end of the applicable reporting period. Therefore, Endo will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter except through public announcement. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to Endo.\nAll forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Endo's current analysis of existing trends and information and represent Endo's judgment only as of the date of this press release. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Endo's businesses, including, among other things, the following: changing competitive, market and regulatory conditions; Endo's ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection for its intellectual property rights; the timing and uncertainty of the results of both the research and development and regulatory processes, including regulatory decisions, product recalls, withdrawals and other unusual items; domestic and foreign health care and cost containment reforms, including government pricing, tax and reimbursement policies; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; the performance, including the approval, introduction, and consumer and physician acceptance of new products and the continuing acceptance of currently marketed products; the effectiveness of advertising and other promotional campaigns; the timely and successful implementation of strategic initiatives; the timing or results of any pending or future litigation, investigations or claims or actual or contingent liabilities, settlement discussions, negotiations or other adverse proceedings; timing and uncertainty of any acquisition, including the possibility that various closing conditions may not be satisfied or waived, uncertainty surrounding the successful integration of any acquired business and failure to achieve the expected financial and commercial results from such acquisition; the uncertainty associated with the identification of and successful consummation and execution of external corporate development initiatives and strategic partnering transactions; and Endo's ability to obtain and successfully maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand in a timely manner. In addition, U.S. and international economic conditions, including higher unemployment, political instability, financial hardship, consumer confidence and debt levels, taxation, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, international relations, capital and credit availability, the status of financial markets and institutions, fluctuations or devaluations in the value of sovereign government debt, as well as the general impact of continued economic volatility, can materially affect Endo's results. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Endo expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required to do so by law.\nAdditional information concerning the above-referenced risk factors and other risk factors can be found in press releases issued by Endo, as well as Endo's public periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and with securities regulators in Canada, including the discussion under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Endo's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
