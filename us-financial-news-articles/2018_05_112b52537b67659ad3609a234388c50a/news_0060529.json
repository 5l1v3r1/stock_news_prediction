In the case of Comcast making an offer, the company promises to postpone or adjourn the upcoming meeting in order to allow stockholders to review the disclosure.\nThe bidding war between Comcast and Disney heated up earlier this month, when Comcast announced in its statement that “Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney.” The Fox-Disney deal is valued at approximately $52 billion.
