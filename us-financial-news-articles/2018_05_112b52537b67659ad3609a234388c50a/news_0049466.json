The trio play at the Sharks where their father Robert is the coach.\nA new captain is due to be announced on Monday by Erasmus as injury has ruled out both Warren Whiteley and Eben Etzebeth. The 2017 SA Rugby Player of the Year Malcolm Marx is also out.\nThe four tests present prop Tendai Mtawarira with a chance to reach the milestone of 100 caps. He has 98.\n“The coaching staff has done a lot of preparation and the players’ contribution in this process, during and after our three camps, has been tremendously positive,” said Erasmus in an SA Rugby statement.\n“We know Wales and England will be very thorough in their analysis and overall preparation and we have to be ready for them. The players know what we expect of them, and that they will have to work very hard in a short space of time to be ready for the Tests against Wales and England.”\nSquad:\nOutside backs: Curwin Bosch (Sharks), Aphiwe Dyantyi (Lions), Warrick Gelant, Travis Ismaiel (both Bulls), Willie le Roux (Wasps), Makazole Mapimpi, Sibusiso Nkosi (both Sharks)\nCentres: Lukhanyo Am (Sharks), Damian de Allende (Stormers), Andre Esterhuizen (Sharks), Jesse Kriel (Bulls), Frans Steyn (Montpellier)\nFlyhalves: Robert du Preez (Sharks), Elton Jantjies (Lions), Handre Pollard (Bulls)\nScrumhalves: Faf de Klere (Sale Sharks), Embrose Papier, Ivan van Zyl (both Bulls), Cameron Wight (Sharks)\nProps: Thomas du Toit (Sharks), Steven Kitshoff, Wilco Louw, Frans Malherbe (all Stormers), Tendai Mtawarira (Sharks), Ox Nche (Cheetahs), Trevor Nyakane (Bulls)\nHookers: Bismarck du Plessis (Montpellier), Bongi Mbonambi (Stormers), Chilliboy Ralepelle, Akker van der Merwe (both Sharks)\nLocks: Pieter-Steph du Toit (Stormers), Jason Jenkins (Bulls), Franco Mostert, Marvin Orie (both Lions), RG Snyman (Bulls)\nLoose forwards: Nizaam Carr (Stormers), Dan du Preez, Jean-Luc du Preez (both Sharks), Siya Kolisi (Stormers), Oupa Mohoje (Cheetahs), Sikhumbuzo Notshe (Stormers), Kwagga Smith (Lions), Duane Vermeulen (Toulon).
