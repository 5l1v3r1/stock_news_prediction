The course — offered to its more than 175,000 employees — is aimed at addressing the issues surrounding the arrests last month at a Philadelphia Starbucks of two black men waiting for a business meeting.\nThe issue of any racial bias in Starbucks' stores can be easily resolved through \"common sense,\" said Rensi, while saying Chairman Howard Schultz and CEO Kevin Johnson are good leaders.\n\"Treat people the way you want to be treated,\" said Rensi, also formerly CEO of barbecue chain Famous Dave's of America. \"To have police come and roust out two black men in your facilities is unconscionable.\"\nHowever, he said he would never have closed the stores for the training \"because that means I'm making a lot of customers angry.\"\nEarlier on CNBC , Andy Puzder — formerly chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the owner of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. chains — questioned some of the steps Starbucks took as part of its anti-racial bias campaign.\nPuzder, now a policy advisor at the pro-Trump group America First Policies, argued Starbucks' new policy allowing anyone, even if they don't buy anything, to sit in its cafes and use the restrooms may have been a mistake.
