Both our domestic and international markets posted double digit top-line gains which fueled significant operating expense leverage and a dramatic improvement in profitability compared with a year ago. Looking ahead, I am confident that by staying true to ZAGG’s four key corporate objectives of Product, Brand, Distribution and Operational Excellence, we can further leverage our strong leadership position in the mobile lifestyle category to drive sustained growth over the long-term.”\nFirst Quarter Results ( in millions, except per share amounts )\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Net sales $ 112.1 $ 92.9 Gross profit $ 37.6 $ 28.6 Gross profit margin 34 % 31 % Net income (loss) $ 7.0 $ (6.1 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 0.24 $ (0.22 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 13.6 $ 2.7 Net sales increased 21% to $112.1 million compared to $92.9 million due primarily to (1) the increase in sales of our power management products, particularly accessories supporting the wireless charging ecosystem, and (2) increased sales of screen protection products in key wireless and retail accounts, particularly in international markets.\nGross profit increased to $37.6 million (34% of net sales) compared to $28.6 million (31% of net sales). The increase in gross profit margin was driven primarily by (1) the mix of screen protection products, our highest margin product category, which increased to approximately 50% of net sales compared to approximately 46% of net sales during the three months ended March 31, 2017, and (2) improved margins on mophie-branded products.\nOperating expenses decreased 16% to $29.7 million (26% of net sales) compared to $35.3 million (38% of net sales). The decrease was primarily attributable to (1) a $2.0 million charge in 2017 related to the impairment of a patent that did not recur in 2018, (2) operating expense synergies related to the mophie integration, and (3) a reduction in marketing spend that ultimately shifted into later periods in 2018.\nNet income increased to $7.0 million compared to a net loss of $6.1 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.24 (on 28.7 million shares) compared to diluted loss per share of $0.22 (on 28.1 million shares).\nAdjusted EBITDA was $13.6 million compared to $2.7 million.\n2018 Business Outlook\nThe Company reiterated the following annual guidance for 2018:\nNet sales of $550 million to $570 million Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales in the low to mid 30's range Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million to $80 million Diluted earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.50 Annual effective tax rate of approximately 27%\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held today, May 8, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EDT to review these results.

Readers are cautioned that Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other income (expense), mophie transaction expenses and mophie restructuring charges, mophie employee retention bonus, and impairment of intangible asset) is not a financial measure under US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, this financial information should not be construed as an alternative to any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of operating performance, liquidity or cash flows generated by operating, investing and financing activities, is as there may be significant factors or trends that it fails to address. As such, it should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that it is helpful to some investors as a measure of performance. We caution readers that non-GAAP financial information, by its nature, departs from traditional accounting conventions. Accordingly, its use can make it difficult to compare current results with results from other reporting periods and with the financial results of other companies. We have provided a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental financial information attached to this press release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains (and oral communications made by us may contain) ““forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
