As such, Leumi declared a 292 million shekel dividend for the first quarter.\nLeumi said on Thursday it earned 730 million shekels in the quarter, up from 622 million a year earlier. It had been forecast to earn 769 million shekels, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.\nNet interest income rose 7.1 percent to 2 billion shekels, although non-interest income dipped 13.4 percent due to an appreciation of the shekel and weak capital markets during the first three months of the year.\nCredit loss expenses grew 28.7 percent to 130 million shekels due to more risky loans.\nStill, the bank noted it has become more conservative in its lending policies and is opting not to increase its retail activity. Rather, it has increased lending to small and mid-sized businesses.\nPart of Leumi’s growth is coming from its launch last year of digital bank Pepper, which has tens of thousands of customers.\nThe bank’s Tier 1 ratio, which measures equity capital as a proportion of total risk-weighted assets, fell to 11.11 percent at the end of March from 11.43 percent at the end of 2017.\nLater this year, Leumi expects to post a pre-tax profit of 118 million shekels from the sale of 65.72 percent of Avgol Industries to Bangkok-based petrochemical producer Indorama Ventures.\nLeumi rival Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank, on Thursday posted lower quarterly profit, weighed down by a provision related to an ongoing U.S. tax evasion investigation.\nLeumi’s shares were up 0.2 percent at midday in Tel Aviv.\n$1 = 3.5701 shekels Additional reporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:11:18.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
