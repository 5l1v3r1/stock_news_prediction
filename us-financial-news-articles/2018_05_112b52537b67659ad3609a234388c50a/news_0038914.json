Net loss was negatively impacted by a $0.7 million increase in income tax expense or ($0.03) per basic and ($0.03) per diluted common share in 2018 compared to the same period on 2017. Revenue was $25.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $21.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.8 million or 17.4%. Combined UK and Other Foreign Market Segments revenue was $9.8 million for the period ended March 31, 2018 compared to $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.5 million or 5.6%. Cash sales were $27.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $24.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.2 million or 13.1%. Total operating costs and expenses were $26.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $22.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.5 million or 15.5%.

Revenue increased $3.8 million or 17.4% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
