Recent high temperatures that helped wheat have led to too-rapid vertical growth in rapeseed without sufficient branch development, and buds are suffering, it said, explaining why the rapeseed crop forecast was being reduced.\nGermany is the European Union’s second largest wheat producer after France and in most years the EU’s largest grower of rapeseed, Europe’s main oilseed for edible oil and biodiesel production.\nGerman farmers have planted more spring grains partly because of the difficulty in sowing winter crops.\nThe spring barley crop, used for malt and beer production, is expected to jump 30.4 percent year-on-year to 2.39 million tonnes.\nThe winter barley crop, used mostly for animal feed, is forecast to fall 3.0 percent to 8.74 million tonnes.\nThe grain maize (corn) crop is projected to fall 2.6 percent to 4.30 million tonnes, the association said.
