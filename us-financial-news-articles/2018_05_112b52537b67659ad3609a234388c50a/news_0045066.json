Even when markets appeared to have fair competition, often they were concentrated in the hands of a few dominant players, he said.\nValletti cited two-sided markets connecting separate user groups - which in the case of Facebook are consumers and advertisers.\n\"There is no way from the economist's point of view ... why we should intervene less in these markets. If anything I would expect more intervention in two-sided markets,\" he said.\nValletti said fears that regulatory action could hurt Facebook were exaggerated.
