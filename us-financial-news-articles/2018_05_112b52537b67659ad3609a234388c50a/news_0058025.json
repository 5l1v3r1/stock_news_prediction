As a result, the yield spread between 10-year Italian and German bonds has reached its highest since December 2013.\n“The sudden, broad widening of euro zone yield spreads caught market participants off guard and is a key factor in the euro’s sell-off. Basically, German bund yields are declining and this is negative for the euro,” said Yukio Ishizaki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n“There are still a lot of euro long positions that had been built up during the currency’s bull phase until May that need to be unwound, and the euro’s decline looks set to continue indefinitely.”\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 94.394 and not far from a 6-1/2-month peak of 94.496 scaled on Monday.\nThe U.S. currency was 0.25 percent lower at 109.155 yen after rising briefly to 109.830 on Monday.\nThe euro was down 0.2 percent at 126.960 yen after brushing 126.820, its lowest since late June 2017.\nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars were steady at $0.7545 and $0.6939, respectively.
