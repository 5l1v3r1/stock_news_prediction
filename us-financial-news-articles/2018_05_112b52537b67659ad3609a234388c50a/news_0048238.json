The exchange is currently testing out copper options via simulated trading.\nThe chairman said ShFE would explore opportunities to set up warehouses in the Hainan free-trade zone, which China is aiming to establish by 2020, and overseas, without specifying for which commodities.\n(Reporting by Tom Daly; additional reporting by Aizhu Chen; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T11:39:57.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
