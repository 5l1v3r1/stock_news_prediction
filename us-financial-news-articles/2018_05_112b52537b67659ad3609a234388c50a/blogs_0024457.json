Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. You can be forgiven if the term “artificial intelligence” instills a tiny feeling of existential dread—a realization that the same tech promising revolution in health care also may contain the seed for less healthy outcomes for humanity in general. Not helping matters: Recent pronouncements on AI by various superpowers.\nChina has made known its desire to become an AI powerhouse . Russia’s Vladimir Putin last year equated AI dominance with ruling the world. On Thursday, the White House, a little late to the great game, hosted a meeting involving representatives from about 40 companies, including Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. as well as Ford Motor Co . and Walmart Inc. , to discuss how the U.S. could maintain its lead in AI.\nThe gathering followed a template for meetings of this type: Support was offered, ‘atta-boys’ were distributed. Still, the meeting acknowledged that AI, increasingly, has become tied to something larger. “Other countries are very organized,” Naveen Rao, Intel Corp.’s vice president and general manager of artificial intelligence, tells the Journal’s John D. McKinnon . “Some of them can use government to remove barriers to technology adoption in a way we can’t because we operate differently. If we don’t find a way to do that here, we risk losing our edge.”\nCIO JOURNAL EXCLUSIVE\nFord promotes Jeff Lemmer to CIO. Ford Motor Co. named 31-year veteran Jeff Lemmer chief information officer Thursday as the automaker continues to cut costs and works to keep pace with rivals. Mr. Lemmer tells CIO Journal’s Steven Norton that he will oversee the continued restructuring of the global IT organization over the next 12 to 15 months, with a focus on agile processes and product-focused teams. The effort is part of Ford CEO Jim Hackett’s broader mandate to cut costs and improve “operational fitness” across the firm.\nTECH EARNINGS\nPhoto: PHOTO: THOMAS WHITE/REUTERS\nMore users pony up for Dropbox. The data-storage provider said it added about half a million paying customers in the first quarter, the Journal’s Jay Greene reports . That helped the company increase revenue by 28% in its first financial report as a public company. Dropbox said it had more than 500 million registered users of both its free and paid services.\nSymantec says annual report may be delayed. Symantec Corp . said its financial results and forecast may change based on the outcome of an internal investigation that was initiated after concerns were raised by a former employee, reports Reuters .\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nFor the first time, the full cache has been made public of more than 3,000 ads that Facebook, the company logo of which is seen here in a photo illustration, said were purchased by a pro-Kremlin group. Photo: JAAP ARRIENS/ZUMA PRESS\nThousands of Russia-Linked Facebook ads released. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday made public for the first time the full cache of more than 3,000 ads that Facebook Inc. said were purchased by a pro-Kremlin group, the Internet Research Agency. The Wall Street Journal reports that documents show how Russian propagandists grew increasingly sophisticated in the run up to the 2016 presidential election, targeting specific regions and people with certain job titles.\nNet neutrality rules to end June 11. After repealing Obama-era “net neutrality” rules in December, the Federal Communications Commission said Thursday that new rules allowing internet providers to block or slow websites as long as they disclose the practice would go into effect next month, according to Reuters . The U.S. Senate is expected to vote as early as next week on whether to reject the repeal.\nPlease don’t Skype me. Since buying Skype from private equity investors, Microsoft Corp. has refocused the online calling service on the corporate market, Bloomberg writes . That pivot has come at a price as the complexity of corporate software alienates the simplicity-driven consumer. Many Skypers say it’s less intuitive and harder to use, which could be a boon for similar tools offered by the likes of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’ s Google.\n19th century retail giant goes e-commerce. Sears Holdings Corp. will provide tire installation and balancing services for people who buy any brand of tire on Amazon.com Inc. , the WSJ’s Aisha Al-Muslim and Suzanne Kapner report . The company also plans to make its Sears Auto Center locations a pick-up point for Amazon tire orders.\nStage set for battle over data privacy in Europe. A battle is looming in Europe over what information Facebook, Google and other companies can demand from you. It boils down to what they really need to know—a debate that could end up in courts for years. The Journal’s Sam Schechner has more .\nMusk: Rocket launches will be as routine as airline flights. Staking out another bold space objective, Elon Musk said the latest configuration of his rocket is designed to fly as many as 10 times without any scheduled maintenance, and ultimately could be refurbished and blast off at least 100 times. The Journal’s Andy Pasztor reports that Mr. Musk’s latest comments risk a repeat of that dynamic if the company fails to deliver. Over the years, the company has fallen short of goals to increase launch rates or complete new spacecraft on schedule.\nWHAT YOUR CEO IS READING\nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\nWhen the killer AI comes. The world-conquering artificial intelligence many fear likely will come from your friendly-neighborhood corporation, says the New Yorker’s Tad Friend , who surveys literature, white papers and scary quotes from Stephen Hawking and philosopher Nick Bostrom for clues into humanity’s fate. Corporations pay developers handsomely and they “lack the constitutional framework” for keeping matters of this importance in check. Because building the first artificial general intelligence matters more than building the first “safe” one, “the race seems designed to go to whichever company assembles the most ruthless task force.”\nKansans not in Kansas anymore. Mechanization has depopulated rural Kansas, leaving towns empty and smaller farmers relying on commodity markets, where they have no control over price. Native Kansan Corie Brown takes the backroads for New Food Economy , chalking up the little victories— a coffee roaster in Saint Francis (population 1,300), a well-stocked grocery store in Downs (population 844), a rebirth in organic farming—in a story that likely won’t end well. Gaze through the grain dust haze and what’s happening in Kansas hints at dramatic demographic shifts worldwide as automation supplants humans. “Such people will not care about the place or the land,” says Laszlo Kulcsar, head of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, and Education at Pennsylvania State University. “They will be people with no other options.”\nAI: Alchemy or engineering? A Google AI researcher says peers have little understanding of the field. Science Magazine’s Matthew Hutson reports that the accusation, made by Ali Rahimi, has attracted support from some of the biggest names in the industry. “People gravitate around cargo-cult practices,” relying on ‘folklore and magic spells,’ says François Chollet, a computer scientist at Google. For the defense, Yann LeCun, Facebook’s chief AI scientist, says focusing too much time on understanding AI blunts innovation. “Engineering is messy,” he says.\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nSome countries are accepting quota s on their exports to the U.S. as they strike deals with the Trump administration to avoid tariffs. (WSJ)\nThe consumer-price index rose 0.2% in April, while average hourly pay for private-sector workers was flat and average weekly earnings fell 0.1%, taking inflation into account. (WSJ)\nNo rest for Hollywood . A behemoth box-office contender will open nearly every week. Han Solo and Deadpool duke it out with ‘Jurassic World’ dinosaurs and Dwayne Johnson. (WSJ)\nCritics of short-termism have it wrong : The evidence doesn’t support the idea that the economy is suffering because shareholders’ focus on quarterly reports leads to myopic management.
