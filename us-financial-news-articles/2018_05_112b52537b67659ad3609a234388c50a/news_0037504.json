REUTERS/Yuri Gripas “We don’t think there should be a farm bill vote until we deal with immigration,” Representative Jim Jordan, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Reuters, adding they have relayed the message to leadership.\nThe Freedom Caucus has about 30 members in the 435-seat House and they have been pushing for consideration of a conservative immigration bill. If caucus members oppose the farm bill, it could derail its chances in the Republican-controlled chamber, where Democrats oppose it for changes it would make to nutrition assistance programs.\nReporting By Richard Cowan, Susan Cornwell and Amanda Becker; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:45:02.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
