In the book, though, he discussed the lasting impact a one-hour meeting with Grove had on him. In particular, he writes, employees were judged less on their expertise in a subject and more on their achievements.\n“ It almost doesn’t matter what you know … To claim that knowledge was secondary and execution all-important—well, I wouldn’t learn that at Harvard,” writes Doerr in the book. “I found the proposition thrilling, a real-world affirmation of accomplishment over credentials. But Grove wasn’t finished, and he had saved the best for last. Over a few closing minutes, he outlined a system he’d begun to install in 1971, when Intel was three years old. It was my first exposure to the art of formal goal setting. I was mesmerized.”\nGates is arguably an even bigger fan of Grove, saying “I studied several of the business books he wrote early on, and Microsoft adopted some of the methods that Intel used. I consider Andy one of the great business leaders of the 20th century.”", "external_links": ["https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Measure-What-Matters"], "published": "2018-05-18T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:03:02.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
