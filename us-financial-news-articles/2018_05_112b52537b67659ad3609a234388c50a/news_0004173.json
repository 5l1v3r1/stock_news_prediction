The pact would have become effective “upon execution of stipulations discontinuing the Deason litigation with respect to the Xerox defendants,” according to a statement. In the absence of such stipulations, the agreement expired May 3, it said.\nThe news caps a tumultuous week for the American maker of office products. The deal it announced Tuesday was seen as a major victory for the activist shareholders, who accused Jacobson of striking the Fujifilm agreement without the board’s authorization to preserve his own job. The company had said the new board would look at alternatives, including terminating or restructuring the pact with Fujifilm.\n“Now it’s just more uncertainty.,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Simon Chan in Hong Kong. “We don’t know if the deal is back on. There’s something happening behind the scenes, which does not raise confidence in the deal or the company.”\nFight Continues Icahn and Deason confirmed the settlement pact with Xerox has expired and promised to continue the fight.\n“The Xerox board recklessly refused to follow through with the leadership and governance changes we agreed to, demanding unprecedented additional approvals for their own personal self-interest,” they wrote in an open letter to shareholders. “We will continue our fight to rescue and revitalize Xerox.”\nXerox representatives could not be immediately reached outside of office hours.\nFujifilm reiterated its call for the Xerox board to fulfill the deal agreement. The Japanese company is satisfied the U.S. court has “accepted our view of the importance of an open, orderly and transparent review process before any final decisions are made,” Fujifilm spokeswoman Mizuki Itou said in an emailed statement on Friday.\nA New York judge last week temporarily halted the takeover plan, after Deason filed a suit to stop the pact and terminate existing joint venture agreements between the companies. Fujifilm has said it plans to appeal the court ruling that temporarily blocked the takeover.\nUnder the terms of the takeover announced in January, Xerox, which has a market value of $7.2 billion, would first merge with a joint venture that the company operates with Fujifilm in Asia. Tokyo-based Fujifilm would ultimately end up owning 50.1% of the combined entity, which would expand the joint venture to encompass all of Xerox’s operations. Xerox holders would receive a cash dividend of $9.80 a share under the proposed transaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:58:43.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
