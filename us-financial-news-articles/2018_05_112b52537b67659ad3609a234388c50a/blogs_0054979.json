But the first step is, let's legislate first; let's regulate first. So we know what the playing field looks like.\"\nThe Department of Justice this week launched an investigation into whether traders have been manipulating the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies â€” part of increased regulatory scrutiny in the sector.\nEarlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched HoweyCoins.com , a phony website designed to teach investors what fraudulent initial coin offerings might look like. The North American Securities Administrators Association's \" Operation Crypto-Sweep ,\" a look into 70 possible crypto schemes, also began in May.\nBrian Kelly , founder and CEO of digital investment firm BKCM, told CNBC on \" Power Lunch \" on Thursday that the DOJ's probe is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\"They'll be able to clean [cryptocurrency exchanges] up a little bit,\" said Kelly.\nNeu-Ner said that with a smaller market size and fewer people in an unregulated and often misunderstood industry, it was easier to take advantage of what was unknown.\nNow though, he said, regulations are a good thing, as manipulation would be harder with \"eyes everywhere.\"\n\"Everyone is worried about who's watching,\" he said.\nKelly agreed, pointing out that clear regulatory guidelines and a manipulation-free market were some of the SEC's guidelines for a physically backed exchange-traded fund.\n\"This is one more step toward the maturation of this process,\" Kelly said.\nNeu-Ner has previously warned investors and regulators alike about the need to establish regulations on ICOs. Without them, he said, the U.S. could risk \" falling behind \" other countries in terms of innovation and hosting companies that use blockchain technology.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": ["https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html", "https://www.cnbcafrica.com/tag/ran-neu-ner/"], "published": "2018-05-25T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T04:16:38.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
