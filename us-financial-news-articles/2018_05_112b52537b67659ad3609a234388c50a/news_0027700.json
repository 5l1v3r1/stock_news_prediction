A company spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n“The retailers may have been asked to absorb the incremental hikes as we had seen during Gujarat state elections (in December),” said Senthil Kumaran, senior oil analyst at energy consultancy FGE.\nAn oil ministry spokesman did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nPetrol prices have risen by about 0.2 percent and diesel prices by 0.3 percent in major Indian cities this week, according to data provided by IOC.\n“This government is blatantly lying to the people by telling them that prices are controlled by market mechanisms,” said Abhishek Singhvi, a spokesman for the Congress party.\nGlobal crude oil prices this month hit their highest in more than three years on record Asian demand and after the United States said it would re-impose sanctions on major oil exporter Iran, which is an important supplier to India.
