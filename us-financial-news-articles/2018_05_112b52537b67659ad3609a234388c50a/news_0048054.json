I was informed by the head of one of our intelligence agencies earlier tonight that a meeting or briefing tomorrow would be a bipartisan briefing at a Gang of 8 level, and that would be it and I expect them to live up to that commitment,” Schiff told MSNBC.\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has called the plan to review classified information highly inappropriate and said such a meeting must include Democrats as a “check on the disturbing tendency of the president’s allies to distort facts and undermine the investigation and the people conducting it.”\nTrump’s closest conservative allies in Congress have been clamoring for access to the classified documents. The lawmakers have accused the FBI and Justice Department of political bias against Trump in favor of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, during his successful presidential campaign.\nThe Thursday meeting attendees will be Representatives Devin Nunes, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, and Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, the White House said on Tuesday.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Acting Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed O’Callaghan from the Justice Department are also expected to attend.\nOn Tuesday, a group of Republican lawmakers called for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate the probe into Trump’s campaign, Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, as Trump ramped up his own criticism of the Justice Department.\nConservatives have been criticizing the department, the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the election for months. Their rhetoric intensified after Trump started suggesting on Friday that the FBI might have planted or recruited an informant in his presidential campaign for political purposes.\nMoscow denies election meddling and Trump denies any collusion between Russian officials and his campaign, calling investigations a political witch hunt.\nOn Monday, the Justice Department agreed to investigate “any irregularities” in FBI tactics related to Trump’s campaign. The agreement was made during a meeting between Trump, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Wray.
