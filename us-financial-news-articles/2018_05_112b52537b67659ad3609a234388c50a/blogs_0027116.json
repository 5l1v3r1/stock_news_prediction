But that's OK, you sort of expect that at this stage in the game.\"\nThe U.S. has provided a list of products, such as soybeans, that it wants China to buy more of.\nBefore leaving for the trip, the U.S. delegation had set a list of demands , which the Chinese officials had responded to by the time Americans arrived. While Ross said that much is progress, more remains to be done.\n\"Us selling more to them has more bang for the buck for our economy to begin with, and it's probably less intrusive into their economy,\" he said.\nThe China trade situation was part of a broader discussion.\nHe also discussed the recent tariffs the U.S. has threatened to impose globally, particularly on aluminum and steel. While the U.S. has delayed implementation as it continues negotiating with affected parties, a June 1 deadline approaches.\nRoss cautioned countries, particularly those in the European Union, to get serious about resolving the issue.\n\"The president is not a man of great patience, and so I wouldn't count on further extensions,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:16:03.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
