We know President Trump doesn’t like it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\n“All in all, the bets are – based on the price action in oil – that President Trump does withdraw from the deal,” he added.\nIran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in 2016 after international sanctions against it were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme.\nThe United States has since then, however, expressed doubts over Iran’s sincerity in implementing those curbs.\nTrump has threatened to walk away from the 2015 agreement by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on May 12, which would likely result in a reduction of Iran’s oil exports.\nSome traders, however, are becoming cautious about ever higher oil prices.\nHedge funds cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to May 1, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday, reducing their exposure to positions that would profit from further crude price rises by 11,825 contracts to 444,060.\nLooming over markets is surging output from the United States, where crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has soared by more than a quarter in the last two years, to 10.62 million barrels per day. Only Russia produces more, at around 11 million bpd.\nU.S. output will likely rise further this year, towards or past Russia’s levels, as its energy firms keep drilling for more.\nU.S. energy companies added nine oil rigs looking for new production in the week to May 4, bringing the total count to 834, the highest level since March 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said last Friday.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T04:52:14.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
