In the past few years, gravitational waves have been detected for the first time: ripples in the fabric of space, coming from colliding black holes and neutron stars. Both Marcus Chown’s “The Ascent of Gravity” and A. Zee’s “On Gravity” mention those discoveries, but neither focuses on them. Rather, the books provide the background to our understanding of this fundamental force of nature—a force that is the weakest one known but is, because of its long range, the most important one in the universe at large.\nThe...
