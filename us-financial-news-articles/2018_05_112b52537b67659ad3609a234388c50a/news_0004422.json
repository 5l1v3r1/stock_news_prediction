The PUC’s Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement, which recommended the pipe be shut in March, concurred with ETP’s April 27 request.\nETP had said on Monday that it hoped to restart Mariner East 1 this week.\nThe shutdown forced shippers, including U.S. gas producers Range Resources Corp and Antero Resources Corp, to find another route for their liquids and is likely causing more ethane to be injected into the region’s natural gas pipelines, according to analysts.
