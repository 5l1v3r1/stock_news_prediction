Some 900 Palestinians were wounded, about 450 of them by live bullets, the officials said.\nMost countries say Jerusalem's status should be determined in a final peace settlement, and say moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal.\nKushner will defend the embassy move in his remarks.\n\"While presidents before him have backed down from their pledge to move the American Embassy once they were in office, this president delivered. Because when President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it,\" Kushner will say.\nHe will also address the challenge from Iran a week after Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 I ran nuclear deal despite pressure from European allies to stick with the agreement.\n\"Iran's aggression threatens the many peace-loving citizens throughout the region and the world. From Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond, many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people,\" Kushner will say.\n\"In confronting common threats, and in pursuit of common interests, previously unimaginable opportunities and alliances are starting to emerge,\" he will say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:41:21.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
