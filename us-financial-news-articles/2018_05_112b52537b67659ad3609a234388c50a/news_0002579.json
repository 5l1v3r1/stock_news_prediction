(“ Neptune Dash ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX.V:DASH) (OTC:NPPTF) today announced its financial and operational results for the second quarter ended February 28, 2018. Neptune Dash builds and operates Dash Masternodes and invests in Dash blockchain related technologies. The Company commenced operations on October 30, 2017, completed an amalgamation transaction with Crossroad Ventures Inc. (“ Crossroad ”) and listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “ TSXV ”) on January 22, 2018. As of February 28, 2018, the Company had one wholly-owned subsidiary, Neptune Stake Technologies Corp.\nThe Company’s total assets increased to $16,112,274 as at February 28, 2018 from $4,026,646 as at November 30, 2017. The Company’s significant assets consisted of $2,218,771 in cash and $13,788,723 in Dash digital currency tokens used to power the Company’s Masternode assets.\n\"Neptune Dash is happy to report that 18 Masternodes are fully operational at the end of February 28, 2018 and earning Dash revenues at full capacity. Although we have seen large scale fluctuations in the price of Dash, given that we are not liquidating Dash, these are unrealized changes on our balance sheet and income statement and are expected given the growth stage of the cryptocurrency markets. All Dash earned will continue to be used to build Masternodes and further grow our Dash revenues,” says Cale Moodie, CEO of Neptune Dash.\nQuarterly Highlights\nDuring the quarter, the Company:\nCompleted a $20.7 million private placement financing. Acquired 14,327 additional Dash digital currency tokens to construct and operate 15 additional Dash Masternodes for a total of 18 Dash Masternodes under operations. Increased its cash position by $1,979,622 from $239,149 as at November 30, 2017 to $2,218,771 as at February 28, 2018. Achieved operating revenues of $156,535 from Dash Masternode rewards, compared to $4,338 for the previous period ended November 30, 2017. Completed a reverse takeover of Crossroad and listed on the TSXV under the ticker “DASH.”\nRecent Developments\nSubsequent to the quarter end, the Company commenced a staking network operation and acquired $200,000 in cryptocurrency assets through a wholly-owned subsidiary named Neptune Stake Technologies Corp. and commenced trading on the on the OTC under trading symbol “NPPTF” and FWB under the symbol “1NW”.\nFinancial Review\nThe Company generated revenues of 170 Dash or $156,535 for the three months ended February 28, 2018. The Company did not sell any Dash earned from its Masternode operations.\nDuring the quarter, the fair market value of Dash declined below the average token purchase price resulting in an unrealized loss of $6,607,597 as at February 28, 2018. The unrealized loss reflects the decline in cryptocurrency prices as a whole from the December peak.\nDuring the quarter, the Company recognized a one-off expense relating to the reverse take-over transaction between Crossroad and the Company. The Company recorded a listing and filing fees expense of $3,512,337. This amount reflects the difference between the estimated fair value of the Company’s shares deemed to have been issued to Crossroad’s shareholders less the net fair value of Crossroad’s assets acquired.\nThe Company earned an additional 207 Dash tokens since February 28, 2018.\nFinancial Statements and MD&A\nThe Company’s Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the three months ended February 28, 2018 will be accessible on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under the Company’s profile and on the Company’s website at https://www.neptunedash.com .\nAbout Neptune Dash Technologies Corp.\nNeptune Dash builds and operates Dash Masternodes and invests in Dash blockchain related technologies.
