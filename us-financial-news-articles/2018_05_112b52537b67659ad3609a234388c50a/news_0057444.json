But a widespread crackdown against his opponents has led rights groups and Western allies of the NATO member to voice concerns about Turkey’s record on civil rights and Erdogan’s growing authoritarianism.\nReporting by Tulay Karadeniz and Thomas Escritt in Berlin; Writing by Daren Butler and Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Toby Chopra and Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-27T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T05:18:33.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
