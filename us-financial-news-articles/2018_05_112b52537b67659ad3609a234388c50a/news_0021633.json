They will grumble and accept it. There is no one who will realistically choose Iran over the U.S.,\" said energy consultancy FGE.\n\"We believe the previous 1 million bpd limit for exports (imposed during previous sanctions) will be reimposed. As before, it may take several rounds of reductions to reach target levels,\" FGE's founder and chairman Fereidun Fesharaki wrote in a note.\n\"Oil prices will certainly move up, and $90-100 per barrel prices may again be on the cards,\" Fesharaki said.\nU.S. bank Goldman Sachs said renewed sanctions and risks to supplies elsewhere, especially in Venezuela, meant there was a high possibility of higher prices than the bank's summer Brent price forecast of $82.50 per barrel.\nThe threat of new sanctions come amid an oil market that has already been tightening due to strong demand, especially in Asia, and as top exporter Saudi Arabia and top producer Russia have led efforts since 2017 to withhold oil supplies to prop up prices.\nU.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA> fell by 2.2 million barrels in the week to May 4, to 433.76 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), slightly above the 420 million barrels five-year average level.\nOne factor that could prevent markets from tightening further is soaring U.S. oil output.\n\"Higher prices are more than likely to be capped as...U.S. shale producers turn the taps back on the longer prices remain above break-evens,\" said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\nWeekly U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> hit another record last week, climbing to 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd).\nThat's up 27 percent since mid-2016 and means U.S. output is creeping ever closer to that of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T10:09:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
