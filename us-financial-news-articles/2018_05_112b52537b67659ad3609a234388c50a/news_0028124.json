It is funded by Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen.\n- Indonesia last year became the first nation to share its proprietary vessel monitoring system (VMS) to allow tracking of its commercial fishing fleet. Peru has promised to follow suit.\n- Indonesia’s VMS data is shared through Global Fishing Watch, a transparency platform co-founded by Google.\n- VMS is a more secure way of tracking vessels than the automatic identification system (AIS), but access has so far been limited to governments and/or intergovernmental agencies.\n- Commercial vessels broadcast AIS signals publicly, but only large vessels are required to have the system, and it can be tampered with.\n- Evidence from these platforms is usually inadmissible in court, but can help the authorities to look more closely at certain vessels.\nSources: FAO, ODI, Sea Around Us, Global Fishing Watch, OceanMind, SkyLight, Vulcan, FishSpektrum, Trygg Mat Tracking, Human Rights Watch, Oceana, WWF, FISH-i-Africa.\nReporting by Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
