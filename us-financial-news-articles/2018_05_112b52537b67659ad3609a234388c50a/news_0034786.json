Finally, shoppers can be part of the solution not the problem.”\nBritish supermarket giant Iceland [MUNDBF.UL], Dutch supermarket Ekoplaza, which launched a plastic-free aisle earlier this year, and British tea company teapigs are among the first companies to adopt the label.\nLast month, more than 40 companies including Britain’s biggest supermarkets, Coca Cola, Nestle [NESNHO.UL] and Procter & Gamble , signed up to the UK Plastics Pact, pledging to eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic packaging by 2025.\nIn January, privately-owned Iceland became the first British supermarket to promise to eliminate plastic packaging from all of its own-brand products.\n“With the grocery retail sector accounting for more than 40 percent of plastic packaging in the UK, it’s high time that Britain’s supermarkets came together to take a lead,” said Iceland’s managing director Richard Walker in a statement.\nIn 2015 Britain introduced a charge for plastic bags which has led to an 80 percent reduction in plastic bag use since 2015.\nNearly 200 nations late last year signed a U.N. resolution to eliminate plastic pollution in the sea, a move some hope will pave the way to a legally binding treaty.\nReporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Claire Cozens.
