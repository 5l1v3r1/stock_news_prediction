CVG 12.64% is in talks with several parties interested in the call-center operator, according to people familiar with the matter, as the company looks for a buyer that could help it bulk up at a time of rapid change in the industry.\nThe Cincinnati-based company, which has a market value just over $2 billion, kicked off a sales process after its chief executive, Andrea Ayers, decided to step down and is deep into discussions with a number of parties, according to the people familiar with the matter. The potential buyers include both industry rivals and private-equity firms, the people said.\nThere is no guarantee there will be any deal and Convergys could instead choose to continue as an independent company and replace Ms. Ayers, one of the people said. Convergys announced in January that Ms. Ayers would step down after nearly 30 years with the company, including more than five as CEO.\nConvergys shares surged nearly 13% to close at $25.30 after The Wall Street Journal reported the sales process.\nConvergys operates 136 call centers in which employees interact with clients’ customers on the phone and, increasingly, via other means like chat and interactive voice response. Once part of Cincinnati Bell Inc . CBB 0.30% , the company had about 110,000 employees in 33 countries as of the end of March.\nIt reported this week that revenue in the first quarter fell 10% on a constant-currency basis to $674 million as key customers like AT&T Inc. reduce their business with the company.\nConvergys has been buffeted, like rivals, by a shift toward automation of customer-service functions and by consolidation among customers.\nThat has helped trigger a wave of consolidation in the industry as companies seek scale to cut costs and invest more to transform their businesses. German media giant Bertelsmann SE in January said it was considering a sale of its call-center business, which handles customer service for clients including Facebook Inc. The business has struggled to grow in part because of a drop-off in business with key accounts. France’s Teleperformance SE bought LanguageLine Solutions Inc., a provider of translation services, for about $1.5 billion in 2016.\nConvergys bought Stream Global Services Inc. for more than $800 million in 2014 as part of an effort to push more into so-called business-process outsourcing, which involves functions like sales and tech support.\nActivist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp., which sometimes pushes companies to sell themselves, earlier this year disclosed a roughly 4.9% stake in Convergys. It hasn’t said anything publicly about its intentions.\nWrite to Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com and Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T01:28:29.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
