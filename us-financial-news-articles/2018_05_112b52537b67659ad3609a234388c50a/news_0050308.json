Khosrowshahi plans on taking the company public next year, and must trim losses, hire a chief financial officer after a three-year vacancy and prove Uber can make a profit.\nAlso on Wednesday, Uber said it would hold a secondary stock sale for employees and existing investors that would value the company at $62 billion, up from the $48 billion valuation it commanded in a secondary sale late last year. Coatue Management, a new investor, and existing Uber investors Altimeter Capital and TPG will purchase up to $600 million of stock at $40 a share.\nThe transaction will launch next week and likely close at the end of June, Uber said. The deal does not bring in new money for the company but rather allows employees and investors to get some cash for their stock even as the company remains private, a sign that Uber management is trying to appease long-time shareholders antsy for a payout.\nIn Uber's previous secondary stock sale, which was led by SoftBank Group Corp, there were so many eager sellers that shareholders could sell only a fraction of what they wanted. In that deal, investors bought shares for $33 each.\nUber reported ride bookings of $11.3 billion for the first quarter, up 4 percent from $10.8 billion in the previous quarter and 51 percent from $7.5 billion a year ago. Its revenue was $2.6 billion, up 8 percent from $2.4 billion last quarter and 73 percent from $1.5 billion a year ago.\nWhen excluding the gain from Uber's sale of its Southeast Asia business to rival Grab and its Russia business to competitor Yandex, as well as other one-time transactions, the company lost $312 million, much less than the $775 million it lost last quarter and an improvement from the $598 million lost a year ago.\nUber said it spent $700 million over five years in Southeast Asia and $170 million on its Russia business during its more than three years there. The company gained about $3 billion after selling those businesses, which followed Uber's sale of its China business to competitor Didi in 2016, as overseas markets prove increasingly costly and difficult.\nBut Uber cautioned not to expect a profit any time soon.\nThe company plans to reinvest the money on growing its food-delivery service, Uber Eats, and bike-renting service. Uber last month bought JUMP, an electric bike service startup, as part of its effort to expand its transportation offerings.\n\"We are off to a terrific start in 2018,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"We plan to reinvest any over-performance even more aggressively this year, both in our core business as well as in big bets like Uber Eats globally.\"\nAt the end of March, Uber had about $6.3 billion in cash, thanks in part to a $1.25 billion direct investment by SoftBank and others.\nEven with a smaller global footprint, Uber has risky and expensive efforts including its autonomous car unit, which has been under scrutiny since a self-driving Uber SUV hit and killed a woman in Arizona in March. Uber on Wednesday said it had shut down its Arizona self-driving car operation, although it plans to continue testing the vehicles in California and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
