(\"STBZ\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: STBZ) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Cadence Bancorporation (\"Cadence\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will be entitled to receive 1.16 shares of Cadence's Class A common stock in exchange for each share of STBZ they hold, representing consideration of $33.98 based on Cadence's May 14 closing price.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether STBZ's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $36.50 per STBZ share.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether STBZ's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects. If you own STBZ shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.
