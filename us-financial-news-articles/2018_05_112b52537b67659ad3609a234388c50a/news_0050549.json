(NYSE:ENV) (the “Company”), a leading provider of intelligent systems for wealth management and financial wellness, announced today that it has priced an offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), which will be sold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company also granted to the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase within a 30-day period up to an additional $45 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The sale is expected to close on May 25, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes will be general unsecured obligations, subordinated in right of payment to the Company’s obligations under its revolving credit facility.\nThe Notes will mature on June 1, 2023, unless earlier purchased, redeemed or converted. Interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate of 1.75% per year and will be payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2018.\nThe Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2022 only under certain circumstances and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 14.6381 shares of the Company’s common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $68.31 per share of the Company’s common stock). Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled, at the Company’s election, in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock.\nThe Company may redeem the Notes for cash, at its option, on or after June 5, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, any of the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption.\nThe Company estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering expenses, will be approximately $291.3 million (or approximately $335.1 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional Notes). The Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding principal balance of its revolving credit facility. The Company expects to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering, as well as the increased amounts available under its revolving credit facility, for general corporate purposes, which may include selective strategic investments through acquisitions, alliances or other transactions and to opportunistically repurchase or retire its outstanding 1.75% Convertible Notes due 2019.\nThe Notes were offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Neither the Notes nor the shares of the Company’s common stock into which the Notes are convertible have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nThis announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes (or the shares of the Company’s common stock into which the Notes are convertible), nor will there be any offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.\nCautionary Statement\nThe statements in this release relating to the terms and timing of the proposed offering and the expected use of proceeds from the offering are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to, the anticipated closing date of the offering, the anticipated use of the proceeds of the offering, which could change as a result of market conditions or for other reasons, and the impact of general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally. Factors that could cause such differences are described in the Company’s periodic filings with SEC.\nYou are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company’s forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or new information after this May 22, 2018 press release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nAbout Envestnet\nEnvestnet, Inc.
