Renner brings nearly three decades of experience\nCHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pinnacle Financial Partners has tapped a veteran banking leader with deep roots and experience in South Carolina to lead its coastal banking team. Mickey M. Renner is the firm’s new regional president for the entire South Carolina coast, including Myrtle Beach, Charleston and Hilton Head. He starts work immediately at Pinnacle’s office on Johnnie Dodds Boulevard in Mount Pleasant, which is in the Charleston area.\nRenner has 27 years of experience in financial services and spent his entire career at Wachovia, now Wells Fargo. Since 2009, he has been the Wells’ South Carolina business banking executive with responsibility for Charleston, Columbia, Greenville and Florence.\n“Mickey’s accomplishments in South Carolina banking are second to none,” said Rick Callicutt, Pinnacle’s chairman for the Carolinas and Virginia. “He was a top tier producer in loans, deposits and fee business at Wells, and he did it all while leading a team of nearly 80 people. His track record of servant leadership and service to clients are a perfect fit for Pinnacle.”\nRenner is a South Carolina native who has served clients all over the state but has been eager to put down permanent roots on the coast for many years. The opportunity to lead a growing team at a bank with a track record like Pinnacle’s was the perfect fit.\n“Pinnacle is exactly where I need to be,” Renner said. “It takes me back to a more customer-focused way of doing business. Work with your clients and do right by them. That’s what this company is all about. Rick and Terry Turner are genuine people who live and work by a set of beliefs that are right in line with my own: Engage your team, serve your clients and do your best every day to make both of them happy.”\nBefore taking over the South Carolina team for Wells Fargo, Mickey served Wachovia as a business banker, business banking director, small business manager and retail sales manager in various markets in North Carolina. That’s where he first came to Callicutt’s attention.\n“I’ve wanted to work with Mickey for many years, and this was the perfect opportunity,” Callicutt said. “We have an incredible team on the South Carolina coast, and with his leadership they are poised to build on their growth trajectory and reach even greater heights for their clients.”\nRenner is filling a role formerly held by Charlie Rivers, who retired in early 2018 after 40 years as a banker and leader in Charleston. He earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from Western Carolina University and an executive MBA at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler School of Business.\nRenner is very active in professional and community service circles. He sits on the legislative and economic council of the South Carolina Bankers Association and is a board member at both the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce and the South Carolina Council on Economic Education. He is also a commissioner for the South Carolina Education Lottery and serves the boards of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\nRenner’s headshot is available to download at www.pnfp.com/mickeyrennerphoto .\nPinnacle Financial Partners provides a full range of banking, investment, trust, mortgage and insurance products and services designed for businesses and their owners and individuals interested in a comprehensive relationship with their financial institution. The firm earned a place on FORTUNE’s 2017 and 2018 lists of the 100 Best Companies to Work For in the U.S., and American Banker recognized Pinnacle as the sixth-best bank to work for in 2017.\nPinnacle entered the South Carolina market in 2017 when it acquired BNC Bancorp. Pinnacle continues BNC’s practice of offering community bank service with the resources and sophistication of a larger firm.\nThe firm began operations in a single location in downtown Nashville, TN in October 2000 and has since grown to approximately $22.9 billion in assets as of March 31, 2018. As the second-largest bank holding company headquartered in Tennessee, Pinnacle operates in 11 primarily urban markets in Tennessee, the Carolinas and Virginia.\nAdditional information concerning Pinnacle, which is included in the NASDAQ Financial-100 Index, can be accessed at www.pnfp.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180521005792/en/\nPinnacle Financial Partners\nJoe Bass, 615-743-8219\njoe.bass@pnfp.com\nSource: Pinnacle Financial Partners", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnfp.com%2F&esheet=51809707&newsitemid=20180521005792&lan=en-US&anchor=www.pnfp.com&index=2&md5=cdc0ba20aee626d28507a87e350c0de7", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnfp.com%2Fmickeyrennerphoto&esheet=51809707&newsitemid=20180521005792&lan=en-US&anchor=www.pnfp.com%2Fmickeyrennerphoto&index=1&md5=4abb7d502365200aaf8dbbd4eeb35f37", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180521005792/en/"], "published": "2018-05-21T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T20:38:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
