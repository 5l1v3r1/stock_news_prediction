Geraghty will manage the day-to-day airline operation, focusing on efforts to deliver a leading customer service experience, execute key structural cost initiatives and enhance operational performance. She will also oversee JetBlue’s commercial team, led by Marty St. George, JetBlue’s executive vice president, commercial and planning.\nGeraghty joined JetBlue in 2005 and was most recently executive vice president, customer experience, responsible for delivering the JetBlue experience to millions of customers annually through her leadership of 15,000 customer-facing crewmembers.

We first disrupted this industry nearly 20 years ago and we will continue to do so,” said Hayes. “This new structure will allow focus on the core airline business while providing an organizational structure to innovate and grow in the travel and vacations space. Joanna has played an important role in JetBlue, and I look forward to working closely with her for many years to come.”\n“I’m honored and humbled to take on this role and I am committed to supporting our nearly 22,000 crewmembers at JetBlue as we continue to prove why we are the airline that inspires humanity,” said Geraghty. “We believe we can be a great business for our owners, a great place to work for our crewmembers, and the best airline for customers. Our passion for the crewmember and customer experience, combined with our commitment to low costs, makes us a unique player in the industry with a lot of runway ahead.”\nGeraghty received her undergraduate degree from the College of the Holy Cross and her master’s in international relations and juris doctor from Syracuse University.\nLeaders with additional responsibilities include:\nWarren Christie has been named senior vice president safety, security and fleet operations reporting to Geraghty.
