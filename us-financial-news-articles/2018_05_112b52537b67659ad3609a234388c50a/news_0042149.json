We grew as a team through a season ravaged by injuries,” added Doncic, who remained tight-lipped about a possible summer move to the NBA.\nThe titanic tussle shifted Real’s way in the third quarter when they carved out a 63-55 lead and never looked back, although Fenerbahce missed a chance to force overtime.\nTheir late fightback slashed the deficit to 81-78 in the final minute, but Real’s Tray Tompkins tipped in a vital offensive rebound to put the game beyond Fenerbahce.
