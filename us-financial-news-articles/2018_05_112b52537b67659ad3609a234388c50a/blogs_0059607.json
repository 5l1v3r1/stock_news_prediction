The military has also stepped in to secure many deliveries, and police operations helped break up many blockades.\nOn Tuesday, the army and police provided escort for 300 trucks filled with goods in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The army has also been escorting deliveries of fuel to airports. However, airports in the interior, far from coastal refineries, are reporting shortages. Many flights have been grounded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:07:30.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
