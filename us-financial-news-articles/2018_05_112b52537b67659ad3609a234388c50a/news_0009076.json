Year-to-date organic revenues have increased by 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.52 vs. $0.59 one year ago. Delivered a record adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21, an increase of 25% over the prior year. Adjusted Operating Margin was 38.1% for the quarter, up 80 basis points over the prior year. Acquired Atlanta Biologicals whose products focus on supplying cell culture sera, media and reagents for the life science research market.\nThe company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Adjusted EPS, adjusted earnings, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading \"Use of non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures.\" A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is included in this press release.\n\"The team delivered a solid quarter on both the top and bottom line with a record adjusted EPS of $1.21,\" said Chuck Kummeth, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. \"Our business is on track year-to-date, with the Biotech division delivering an excellent quarter and Protein Platforms performing well everywhere except in Biologics, which took a pause after the incredible Q2 we had in that business. The Protein Platforms Simple Western and SimplePlex platforms continued with double-digit growth in Q3 as they gain critical mass\".\nKummeth added, \"All regions contributed in the quarter, with over 20% revenue growth in China and continued strong performance from our team in Europe. I'm very proud of the whole Bio-Techne family who continue to focus on demonstrating how our products work together to create work-flow synergies for our customers. I look forward to completing what looks to be a record year in the making.\"\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018\nRevenue\nNet sales for the third quarter increased 14% to $164.0 million. Organic growth was 7% compared to the prior year, with currency translation having a positive impact of 4% and acquisitions contributing 3% to revenue growth.\nGAAP Earnings Results\nGAAP EPS decreased to $0.52 per diluted share, versus $0.59 in the same quarter last year. An impairment loss on the Company's investment in Astute Medical, which negatively impacted GAAP EPS by $0.32. GAAP operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 29% to $43.1 million, compared with $33.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP operating margin was 26.3%, compared to 23.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP operating margin compared to prior year was positively impacted by strong volume leverage and lower acquisition related expenses.\nNon-GAAP Earnings Results\nAdjusted EPS increased to $1.21 per diluted share, versus $0.97 in the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 16% compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 38.1%, compared with 37.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin compared to the prior year was positively impacted by strong volume leverage. Also of note, the Company's investment in ChemoCentryx grew to $86.6 million in the third quarter from increases in market value, representing a $1.44 per share before-tax built-in gain. Currently, GAAP requires changes in valuation of investments in publicly traded securities to be reflected in the equity section of the Balance Sheet until the investment is sold.\nSegment Results\nManagement uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the Company's three business segments, as highlighted below. Since these results are used for this purpose, they are also considered to be prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nBiotechnology Segment\nThe Company's Biotechnology segment develops, manufactures and sells proteins, antibodies, immunoassays, flow cytometry products, intracellular signaling products, assays to study cell growth and behavior, as well as biologically active chemical compounds used in biological research and ACD's in situ hybridization detection products. Biotechnology segment's third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales were $110.0 million, an increase of 16% from $94.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Organic growth for the segment was 7%, with currency translation having a favorable impact of 5% on revenue growth and acquisitions contributing 4% to revenue growth. Biotechnology segment's adjusted operating margin was 48.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 47.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin compared to the prior year was positively impacted by strong volume leverage.\nProtein Platforms Segment\nThe Company's Protein Platforms segment develops and commercializes proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis. Protein Platforms segment's third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales were $25.5 million, an increase of 8% from $23.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Organic growth for the segment was 4% with currency translation having a favorable impact of 4% on revenue growth. The Protein Platforms segment's adjusted operating margin was 9.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 13.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The lower adjusted operating margin was driven by the timing of additional investments in global commercial resources and administrative infrastructure which have supported the segment's year-to-date 20% organic revenue growth.\nDiagnostics Segment\nThe Company's Diagnostics segment develops and manufactures a range of controls and calibrators for various blood chemistry and blood gas clinical instruments, hematology instruments controls as well as quality controls, diagnostic immunoassays and other bulk and custom reagents for the in vitro diagnostic market. Additionally, the Diagnostics segment develops and manufactures bulk purified proteins, enzymes, disease-state plasmas, infectious disease antigens and processed sera to the clinical diagnostic industry. The Diagnostics segment's third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales were $28.5 million, an increase of 10% from $26.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The Diagnostics segment's adjusted operating margin was 28.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 23.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by increased volume leverage and margin mix of OEM product sales.\nConference Call\nBio-Techne will host an earnings conference call today, May 2, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. CDT.

These non-GAAP measures include:\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share Adjusted net earnings Adjusted gross margin Adjusted operating income Adjusted operating margin\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, and acquisition related expenses. The Company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses, from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. Additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity.\nThe Company's non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes stock based compensation expense and certain adjustments to income tax expense. Stock based compensation is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted financial measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided with the financial statements attached to this press release.\nForward Looking Statements:\nOur press releases may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the actual results of operations.
