Our On Demand segment continues to grow nicely and we are starting to see the progression towards our long term revenue and profitability targets,” commented Phil Heasley, President and CEO, ACI Worldwide. “Following our solid start, we remain confident in achieving our full year guidance.”\nQ1 2018 FINANCIAL SUMMARY\nNew bookings were $215 million, which was up 142% compared to Q1 2017. Total bookings were $266 million, up 44% from last year’s first quarter.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”).\nUnder ASC 606, revenue in Q1 2018 was $209 million. Under ASC 605, Q1 2018 revenue was $225 million, down slightly as expected from Q1 2017 given the timing and size of renewal and capacity events in the quarter.\nIn Q1 2018, revenue from ACI’s On Demand segment grew 5% over last year, on a reported basis. Under the comparative ASC 605 basis, ACI’s On Demand segment grew 6%. ACI On Demand segment adjusted net EBITDA margin increased over 800 basis points from last year, under the comparative ASC 605 basis. Net EBITDA margins are adjusted for pass through interchange revenues representing $40 million and $39 million, for Q1 2018 and 2017, respectively. ACI On Premise segment revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin were both down as expected given the timing and size of renewal and capacity events in the quarter.\nACI ended Q1 2018 with a 12-month backlog of $836 million and a 60-month backlog of $4.4 billion. After adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations and ASC 606-related accounting changes, our 12-month backlog grew $16 million and our 60-month backlog increased $98 million from Q4 2017.\nACI ended Q1 2018 with $74 million in cash on hand, up from $70 million at year end 2017, and a debt balance of $689 million, down $7 million from year end 2017.\nREITERATING GUIDANCE\nThe company expects the adoption of ASC 606 to impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition for its on-premise licensing arrangements. The company does not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on its other revenue streams or cash flows from operations. The company has provided its full-year and second quarter outlook under both ASC 606 and ASC 605 in order to provide additional transparency. The company will continue to provide actual results under both ASC 606 and ASC 605 throughout 2018.\nFor the full year 2018 under ASC 606, the Company expects revenue to be between $1.03 billion and $1.055 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $255 million to $270 million, which excludes approximately $7 million in significant transaction related expenses. We expect between $230 million and $240 million of revenue under ASC 606 in the second quarter.\nFor the full year 2018 under ASC 605, the Company expects revenue to be between $1.05 billion and $1.075 billion, which represents 3-5% growth over 2017 on a comparable GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $270 million to $285 million, which excludes approximately $7 million in significant transaction related expenses. We expect between $240 million and $250 million of revenue under ASC 605 in the second quarter. We expect full year 2018 new bookings growth to be in the low double digits.\nCONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUTLOOK\nManagement will host a conference call at 8:30 am ET to discuss these results as well as 2018 guidance.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management generally compensates for limitations in the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying on comparable GAAP financial measures and providing investors with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures only in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way to view aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Certain non-GAAP measures include:\nAdjusted EBITDA: net income plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest income (expense), net other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, as well as significant transaction-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, operating income.\nACI is also presenting adjusted operating free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, net after-tax payments associated with employee-related actions and facility closures, and net after-tax payments associated with significant transaction-related expenses. Adjusted operating free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC Regulation G. We utilize this non-GAAP financial measure, and believe it is useful to investors, as an indicator of cash flow available for debt repayment and other investing activities, such as capital investments and acquisitions. We utilize adjusted operating free cash flow as a further indicator of operating performance and for planning investing activities. Adjusted operating free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities. A limitation of adjusted operating free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. This measure also does not exclude mandatory debt service obligations and, therefore, does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We believe that adjusted operating free cash flow is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our operating results on the same basis as that used by our management.\nACI backlog includes estimates for SaaS and PaaS, license, maintenance, and services specified in executed contracts but excluded from contracted revenue that will be recognized in future periods, as well as revenues from assumed contract renewals to the extent that we believe recognition of the related revenue will occur within the corresponding backlog period. We have historically included assumed renewals in backlog estimates based upon automatic renewal provisions in the executed contract and our historic experience with customer renewal rates.\nBacklog is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC Regulation G. Our 60-month backlog estimates are derived using the following key assumptions:\nLicense arrangements are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term or under the renewal option stated in the contract at a rate consistent with historical experience. If the license arrangement includes extended payment terms, the renewal estimate is adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component. Maintenance fees are assumed to exist for the duration of the license term for those contracts in which the committed maintenance term is less than the committed license term. SaaS and PaaS arrangements are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term at a rate consistent with our historical experiences. Foreign currency exchange rates are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period for those contracts stated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our pricing policies and practices are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period.\nEstimates of future financial results are inherently unreliable. Our backlog estimates require substantial judgment and are based on a number of assumptions as described above. These assumptions may turn out to be inaccurate or wrong, including, but not limited to, reasons outside of management’s control. For example, our customers may attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for a number of reasons, including mergers, changes in their financial condition, or general changes in economic conditions in the customer’s industry or geographic location, or we may experience delays in the development or delivery of products or services specified in customer contracts which may cause the actual renewal rates and amounts to differ from historical experiences. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact the amount of revenue actually recognized in future periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that contracts included in backlog estimates will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the corresponding 60-month period.\nBacklog estimates should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, reported revenue and contracted but not recognized revenue (including deferred revenue).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Generally, forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may include words or phrases such as “believes,” “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” and words and phrases of similar impact.
