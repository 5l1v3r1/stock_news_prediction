M. Smucker Co buying Rachael Ray Nutrish dog food maker Ainsworth Pet Nutrition for about $1.9 billion last month and Cheerios cereal maker General Mills Inc buying Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc for nearly $8 billion in February.\nOverall, U.S. consumers spent $70 billion on pets in 2017, up four percent from the prior year, with additional increases expected in 2018, according to the American Pet Products Association Inc, a trade group.
