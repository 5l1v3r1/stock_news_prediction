It had hit a five-week low of 108.115 yen the previous day as the risk-averse mood boosted the Japanese currency.\nInvestors are also wary of an escalation in trade frictions between the United States and China after the White House said that it still holds the threat of imposing tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China.\nWashington said it will use it unless Beijing addresses the issue of theft of American intellectual property.\nU.S. bond yields have fallen over the past couple of days, undermining the dollar’s yield attraction and a key reason for the currency’s rapid turnaround in the last month.
