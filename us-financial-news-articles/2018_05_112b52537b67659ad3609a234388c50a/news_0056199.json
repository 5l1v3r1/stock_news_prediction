Bulgaria has reported a handful of outbreaks of bird flu since December, some of them involving the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu virus.\nAt the farm in Stefanovo, a three-kilometer protection zone had been set around the farm and the movement of domestic, wild and other birds and has been banned within it, as has the sale of eggs and poultry, the food safety agency said on its website.\nReporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:32:52.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
