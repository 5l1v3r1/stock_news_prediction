Most of those on the boat intercepted off Sabratha on Monday were North African, including 18 Libyans, Qassem said.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami; Editing by Aidan Lewis and James Dalgleish\nOur ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T01:04:00.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
