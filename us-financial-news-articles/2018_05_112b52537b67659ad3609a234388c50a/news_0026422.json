Easter last year was celebrated in April.\nWeak retail sales should keep the central bank on track to cut interest rates once again next week to an all-time low as it seeks to bolster the sluggish economic recovery.\nRetail sales rose 6.5 percent in March from the year before, above an estimate of 5.5 percent in the Reuters poll.
