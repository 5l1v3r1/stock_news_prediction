I tell people that I was lucky to have been born into this industry and feel the reason is simple. It’s the relationships that have lasted a lifetime. Whether customers, suppliers, employees or consultants, they are all important and they are what make this business rewarding and fun.”\nRHCC traces its roots back to Greene, New York, in 1922, the year George Raymond, Sr. purchased a foundry and breathed life into The Raymond Corporation. Since then, the Raymond brand of electric forklifts has dominated the world of material handling.\nSteve Raymond, George Raymond, Sr.’s grandson, started Raymond Handling Concepts Corporation in Menlo Park, California, in 1987 after progressing through seven jobs in four locations during his first eleven years, having joined The Raymond Corporation in 1976. Since its founding, RHCC has grown and moved from its original location to Newark, California, and finally to Fremont, California, the seat of its corporate headquarters today. With locations in Washington, Oregon, Northern Nevada, Idaho, Western Montana and Alaska, RHCC has become the single source supplier of materials handling and storage equipment and automated systems for any company engaged in warehousing, distribution and manufacturing.\nThe official date for Steve Raymond’s retirement is July 2, 2018.\nFor additional information on the company, please visit www.raymondhandling.com .
