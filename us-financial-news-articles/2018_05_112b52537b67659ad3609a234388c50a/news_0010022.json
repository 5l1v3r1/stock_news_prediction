We delivered record first quarter revenue and net income, driven by the rapid adoption of IPG's high power products within our largest market segments and geographies,\" said Dr. Valentin Gapontsev, IPG Photonics' Chief Executive Officer.\nFirst quarter revenue of $359.9 million increased 26% year over year. Materials processing sales increased 28% year over year and accounted for approximately 94% of total sales driven by strength in cutting and 3D printing applications. Sales to other markets decreased 5% year over year. High power CW laser sales increased 37% year over year, representing 64% of total revenue, with even stronger growth in sales of ultra-high power CW lasers with power levels of six kilowatts and above. By region, sales increased 29% in China and Europe, 39% in Japan, and 3% in the United States, on a year over year basis.\nEarnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") of $1.93 increased 40% year over year. Foreign exchange gains benefited EPS by $0.07. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 25%. IPG's tax rate benefited from the lower U.S. Federal tax rate of 21%, while certain discrete items, including excess tax benefits related to equity compensation, were offset by additional taxes accrued for Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") net of Foreign Derived Intangible Income (\"FDII\") deduction benefits.\nDuring the first quarter, IPG generated $99.7 million in cash from operations and used $39.1 million to finance capital expenditures. IPG ended the quarter with $1.18 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, representing an increase of $59.8 million from December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\n\"During the first quarter of 2018 we achieved the highest level of quarterly bookings in the Company's history. As a result, our first quarter book-to-bill ratio was above 1, positioning us to deliver strong results in the second quarter as well,\" said Dr. Gapontsev.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, IPG expects revenue of $400 million to $430 million, representing growth of 8% to 15% year over year. The Company expects the second quarter tax rate to be approximately 26% excluding effects relating to equity grants, and anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.05 to $2.35, representing growth in the range of 7% to 23% year over year, with 53.7 million basic common shares outstanding and 55.2 million diluted common shares outstanding. At this time, IPG is not updating its 2018 annual guidance.\nAs discussed in more detail in the \"Safe Harbor\" passage of this news release, actual results may differ from this guidance due to various factors including, but not limited to, product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition and general economic conditions. This guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, and is subject to the risks outlined in the Company's reports with the SEC, and assumes exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar of Euro 0.81, Russian Ruble 57, Japanese Yen 106 and Chinese Yuan 6.29, respectively.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nAdditional supplemental financial information is provided in the First Quarter 2018 Financial Data Workbook available on the investor relations section of the Company's website at investor.ipgphotonics.com .\nConference Call Reminder\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, May 1, 2018 at 10:00 am ET.
