It currently holds 25.51 percent. The Chinese group is not aiming for a domination agreement, which would require a stake of at least 75 percent, the sources also said.\nA Grammer spokesman declined to comment.\nReporting by Alexander Huebner; Writing by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Douglas Busvine\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:21:02.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
