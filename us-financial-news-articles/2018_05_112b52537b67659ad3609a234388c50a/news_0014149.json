We are never satisfied with our game and while we are going to enjoy tonight, our focus is the (Waikato) Chiefs match now.”\nThe Stormers made a fast start with two tries to fire up a vocal 30,000 crowd in Cape Town.\nWillemse found the space to dot down after a period of pressure in the Bulls 22, before Louw barged over from close-range for the second.\nThe home side were dominant in the scrum but having won a penalty from the set-piece, Willemse put his effort wide in swirling wind conditions.\nThe Bulls grew into the game and got their first score as De Jager ran on to a clever pass from flyhalf Handre Pollard to race through a gap.\nWhen Pollard added a penalty, the score was 12-10 at halftime.\nThe Bulls dominated territory early in the second period and were rewarded when another clever running line from Jenkins saw him score under the posts to give the visitors the lead.\nBut the home side hit back as centre Damian de Allende set Marais free to score after excellent work in the ruck by Springbok lock Pieter-Steph de Toit.\nWillemse extended the lead further with a penalty, before slick handling from the home side sent Samuels over in the corner.\n“Hats off to the Stormers, they did well to cut off our set-piece and we couldn’t get any momentum,” Bulls captain Burger Odendaal said.
