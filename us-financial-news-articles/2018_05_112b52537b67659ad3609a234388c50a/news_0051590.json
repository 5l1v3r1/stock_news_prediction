The company also has operations in other countries in Africa, including Tanzania and Ghana.\nThe company’s remaining South African assets are Mponeng mine, and a surface operation. The all-in costs of running the business in the first quarter of the year was $1,361 compared with the average gold price of $1,330 per ounce during the period, AngloGold said.\n“This performance emphasises the need to address our cost base to ensure it is appropriate for our much-reduced production,” it said.
