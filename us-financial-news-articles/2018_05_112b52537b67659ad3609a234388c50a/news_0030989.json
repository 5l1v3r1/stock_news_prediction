Leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) speaks during the \"Dialogue for Peace and Justice\" at the Museum of Memory and Tolerance in Mexico City, Mexico May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Gustavo Graf\nLopez Obrador, the former Mexico City mayor, is the first choice of 46 percent of voters surveyed while his nearest rival, Ricardo Anaya, who heads a right-left coalition, has 26 percent support.\nThe result marks slight growth for both Lopez Obrador and Anaya compared to a March survey by El Financiero, while it showed a 4-point decline for Jose Antonio Meade, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who comes in with just 20 percent support.\nThe survey was conducted between April 26 and May 2 and based on 1,000 in-person interviews with voters, with a margin of error of 3.1 percent.\nThe pollâ€™s results stripped out the 38 percent of respondents who said they were undecided in the five-candidate field.\nIn his third consecutive bid to win the presidency, Lopez Obrador, 64, has capitalized on widespread disenchantment with the PRI over political corruption, rising levels of violence and sluggish economic growth.\nThe survey showed independent candidate Margarita Zavala, wife of former President Felipe Calderon, at 5 percent.\nMeanwhile, support for the former governor of the state of Nuevo Leon, Jaime Rodriguez Calderon, another independent hopeful, stood at 3 percent.
