Then, when a client makes a purchase, Trainerize Pay and its automation features jump into action, walking the client through the account setup process, building their profile, collecting their payment, and delivering their purchased product straight to their phone. All of this happens in minutes, making Trainerize Pay the most seamless experience on the market when it comes to both buying and selling online training.\n“We know from our customers that one of the biggest challenges when it comes to running an efficient fitness business is client setup and program delivery,” said Trainerize CEO, Sharad Mohan on the recent release of Trainerize Pay. “We also know that happy clubs and trainers start with happy members and clients. So, we built Trainerize Pay with that in mind, where, if I’m a client and I make the decision to step up and buy personal training services, the moment I pay I get an app in my hands, already loaded with content that’s immediately useful and customized to me. As a client, I can start living a better life, literally, now .”\nThe response to Trainerize Pay, released in BETA last year, has already been overwhelmingly positive, with its all-in-one-place approach and flexible payment options ranking high among the reasons fitness professionals love it. Tim Hennigan, owner of Portland-based fitness studio, The Body Shop, had this to say on Trainerize Pay:\n“Before Trainerize Pay, I was using a couple different platforms to get my clients set up with training programs and payments—and there was a lot of time-consuming admin work that went along with that. Now that I can do it all through Trainerize, I'm saving valuable time and I can get clients set up and training in only a few minutes. It's like, with a click of a mouse, my business is on autopilot. Trainerize Pay has really made it simple for me to keep my system organized and give my clients an amazing experience from the word \"go\". The best part is that the time I don’t have to spend monkeying with payments or client setup allows me to spend more time focusing on the most important part of my business, the people I work with.”\nTo receive additional information about Trainerize or request a software demo, visit www.trainerize.com .
