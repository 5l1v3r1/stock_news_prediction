Marcello Fonte, cast member of the film \"Dogman\" in competition, jokes before the award for the best canine performance. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard The unofficial award is made every year at the festival as an “antidote to the extreme serious human ego issues at the real ceremonies,” said organiser Toby Rose.\nIn the film, directed by Matteo Garrone, known for Naples mafia movie “Gomorrah”, the burglars shut the chihuahua in a freezer to stop it yapping. It is later rescued by the film’s hero.\n“Dogman” is competing for the Palme d’Or - the official prize given to the best film that will be awarded on Saturday.\nWriting by Robin Pomeroy; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T20:03:54.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
