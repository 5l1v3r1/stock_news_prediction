The United States diplomatic corps needs to be in every corner, every stretch of the world, executing missions on behalf of this country and it is my humble, noble undertaking to achieve that,” Pompeo said to loud applause from several hundred diplomatic staff.\nIn the Trump administration, the State Department has been shaken and demoralized by the departures of many senior diplomats and a hiring freeze, and has found itself sidelined by the White House on foreign policy.\nPompeo’s remarks were brief and without any detail on possible changes in store for the department. He is a former congressman who headed the Central Intelligence Agency from January last year until last week and is seen as a loyalist of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nTrump would formally swear him into the new post on Wednesday, Pompeo said. It will be Trump’s first visit to the department. New U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivers remarks to employees on his first day at the State Department in Washington, U.S., May 1, 2018.
