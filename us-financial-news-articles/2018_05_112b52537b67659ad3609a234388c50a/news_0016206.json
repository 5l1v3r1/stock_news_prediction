We also evaluate our performance using certain non-GAAP operating metrics, namely Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP Net Income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Our management believes that these measures provide useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results. We believe these non-GAAP operating metrics provide additional tools for investors to use to compare our business with other companies in the industry.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not measures of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, as alternatives or substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. While we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful within the context described below, they are in fact incomplete and are not a measure that should be used to evaluate our full performance or our prospects. Such an evaluation needs to consider all of the complexities associated with our business including, but not limited to, how past actions are affecting current results and how they may affect future results, how we have chosen to finance the business, and how taxes affect the final amounts that are or will be available to shareholders as a return on their investment. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are found below.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and long-term incentive compensation. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a simplified measure of performance for use in communicating our performance to investors and analysts and for comparisons to other companies within our industry. As a performance measure, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a view of our operating results that is most closely related to serving our customers. By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and long-term incentive compensation we are able to evaluate performance without considering decisions that, in most cases, are not directly related to meeting our customers’ requirements and were either made in prior periods (e.g., depreciation, amortization and long-term incentive compensation), or deal with the structure or financing of the business (e.g., interest) or reflect the application of regulations that are outside of the control of our management team (e.g., taxes). Similarly, we find the comparison of our results to those of our competitors is facilitated when we do not consider the impact of these items.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands, unaudited) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 1,792 $ 573 Interest income, net (393 ) (290 ) Provision for income taxes 629 233 Depreciation and amortization 2,747 2,633 Long-term incentive compensation 1,352 1,100 Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,127 $ 4,249 Non-GAAP Net Income & Non-GAAP Diluted EPS\nWe define non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS, as net income or EPS before the consideration of long-term incentive compensation expenses and the amortization of purchased intangible assets. We use these measures to assess the impact of our performance excluding items that can significantly impact the comparison of our results between periods and the comparison to competitors.\nLong-term incentive compensation for management and others is directly tied to performance and this measure allows management to see the relationship of the cost of incentives to the performance of the business operations directly if such incentives are based on that period’s performance. To the extent that such incentives are based on performance over a period of several years, there may be periods which have significant adjustments to the accruals in the period but which relate to a longer period of time, and which can make it difficult to assess the results of the business operations in the current period. In addition, the Company’s long-term incentives generally reflect the use of restricted stock grants or cash awards while other companies may use different forms of incentives the cost of which is determined on a different basis, which makes a comparison difficult.\nWe exclude amortization of purchased intangible assets as we believe the amount of such expenses in any given period may not be correlated directly to the performance of the business operations and that such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions, the full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets or the write down of such assets due to an impairment event. However, purchased intangible assets contribute to current and future revenue and related amortization expense will recur in future periods until expired or written down. We make a tax adjustment based on the above adjustments resulting in an effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which may differ from the GAAP tax rate. We believe the effective tax rates we use in the adjustment are reasonable estimates of the overall tax rates for the Company under its global operating structure.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income (in thousands except per share data, unaudited) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 1,792 $ 573 Long-term incentive compensation 1,352 1,110 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2,201 2,199 Tax impact of adjustments* (711 ) (662 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 4,634 $ 3,220 Non-GAAP diluted EPS $ 0.12 $ 0.08 Diluted shares outstanding 40,059 39,770 * The tax impact of adjustments is calculated at 20% of the adjustments in all periods\nCopyright © 2018 VASCO Data Security, Inc., VASCO Data Security International GmbH.
