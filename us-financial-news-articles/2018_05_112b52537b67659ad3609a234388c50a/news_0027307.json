I’m not stressing myself about this busy schedule,” she said.\n“I just want to enjoy it. I enjoy it. I’m looking forward already to start the next tournament. There is no pressure. I feel like it’s an opportunity to play my best tennis.”\n“Maybe I didn’t play my best game, but maybe she didn’t let me play my best game. She was really good today.”\nFrance’s Caroline Garcia also made the semi-finals with a straight sets defeat of Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro.
