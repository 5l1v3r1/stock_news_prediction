Plus, you're nearing your peak earning years and you want to make sure you're putting your money to work effectively.\nTo get and stay on track financially, consider these five important money moves to make before you hit 40.\n1. Increase your 401(k) contributions You should already be contributing to your 401(k) plan if your company offers one. The more you can set aside, the better, but at minimum contribute enough to get the full employer match if your company offers one. It's essentially free money.\nNext, you'll want to get in the habit of increasing your contributions consistently, either every six months, at the end of the year or when you get a bonus or a raise.\nCheck online to see if you can set up \"auto-increase,\" which allows you to choose the percentage you want to increase your contributions by and how often. This way, you won't forget to up your contributions, or talk yourself out of setting aside a larger chunk.\nshow chapters Retirement in America is changing rapidly 8:26 AM ET Thu, 9 March 2017 | 00:56 2.
