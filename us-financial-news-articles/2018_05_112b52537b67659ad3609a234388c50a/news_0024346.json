ENSO-neutral refers to those periods in which neither El Niño nor La Niña is present, according to CPC.\nLast month, the weather forecaster said there was a more than 50 percent chance of ENSO-neutral conditions prevailing through the northern hemisphere summer in 2018.\nDuring ENSO-neutral periods, the ocean temperatures, tropical rainfall patterns and atmospheric winds over the equatorial Pacific Ocean are near the long-term average, according to the CPC website.\nReporting by Harshith Aranya and Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:14:41.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
