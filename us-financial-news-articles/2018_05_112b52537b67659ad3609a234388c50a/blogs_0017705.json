If Disney gets into a bidding war with Comcast, then Comcast's bid for all of Sky and Fox could get close to $100 billion, these people said.\nHowever, if the government shoots down AT&T-Time Warner, Comcast does not plan to bid.\nComcast is asking investment banks to increase the bridge financing facility they have already arranged for the Sky offer by as much as $60 billion to finance the Fox bid, Reuters previously reported.\nComcast originally touted its strong stock as a reason for Fox to accept a deal from the largest U.S. cable provider instead of Disney.\nBut Comcast shares have fallen about 15 percent since Disney announced its bid for Fox, and now Comcast thinks it has a better chance with an all-cash bid, even if Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch prefers Disney shares.\nComcast CFO Michael Cavanaugh said on the company's last earnings call, \"Regarding potential acquisitions, it is our job to continuously evaluate whether there are opportunities for us to create value. But should we pursue anything while our stock is at these levels, while circumstances can always change, I think it is unlikely that we would use Comcast shares as a medium of exchange for a transaction.\"\nComcast believes Disney cannot match an all-cash bid for Fox because if it adds more stock to a deal, Fox stock will go down, depressing the value of the offer, sources told CNBC.\nReuters previously reported that Comcast was talking to banks about obtaining bridge financing in preparation for a possible all-cash bid.\nComcast declined to comment. Fox and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nâ€”CNBC's David Faber and Reuters contributed to this report.\nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.\nRelated: Donald Trump's regulators are the only thing holding back a massive American telecommunications revolution\nshow chapters Fox rejects Comcast bid due to antitrust concerns 10:16 AM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 | 05:02 CORRECTION: An earlier version misstated Rupert Murdoch's current title.
