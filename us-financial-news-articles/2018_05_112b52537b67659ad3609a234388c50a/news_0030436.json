The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.
