Picture taken May 10, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Many hotels and apartments are asking several thousand dollars for accommodation that normally costs around $50 per night or cancelling existing bookings to charge higher rates for the expected influx of around 50,000 supporters.\nTo promote a welcoming image of Ukraine, Ukrainians have taken to social media to offer supporters spare beds, lifts from the airport and even home-cooked meals of borscht, a traditional beetroot soup.\nEven President Petro Poroshenko has offered to host a few fans to make up for the lack of affordable accommodation in the capital over the weekend of the final between Liverpool and Spain’s Real Madrid.\n11-year-old Misha shows the apartment where his family will host fans travelling to see the Champions League final game between Real Madrid and Liverpool, in Kiev, Ukraine May 10, 2018.

This is a pleasant and powerful way to connect people from different countries and continents,” he told Reuters in his apartment.\nSlideshow (9 Images) “That is what football means,” he said, surrounded by his children including his soccer-mad son Misha, 11, who was wearing full Liverpool kit.\nThis is not the first time the family have hosted strangers. In 2014, they invited a family to stay for three months who had fled pro-Russian separatist fighting in eastern Ukraine.\nKiev’s outpouring of hospitality stems in part from a desire to show the country has recovered from the worst of a political and economic crisis sparked by a 2013/14 pro-European uprising and subsequent separatist conflict.\nA Facebook group called ‘Kyiv FREE couch’ that matches Ukrainians offering free accommodation with soccer supporters in need of a place to stay has gained over 5,000 members since its launch on May 5.\n“This group should be called ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’,” member Zibby Puculek said in a post, referring to the Liverpool club anthem. “You are very, very nice people.”\nEditing by Matthias Williams and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:56:03.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
