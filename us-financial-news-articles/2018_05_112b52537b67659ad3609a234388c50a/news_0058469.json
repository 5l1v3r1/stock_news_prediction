You’re in a spot where you deserve to be... sometimes it’s how the cookie crumbles and that’s how the draw is done, and we’re playing each other in the second round.”\nBarty stood firmly on the fence on the issue of whether or not Serena should have been seeded.\n“I think it’s an extremely tough question,” she said. “I think probably in certain ways, yes, and I agree with those arguments; and then also I agree with arguments where it’s no.\nTennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 Serena Williams of the U.S. celebrates winning her first round match against Czech Republic's Kristyna Pliskova REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol “I think it’s a tough decision. I know that the WTA are going through all the right processes.\n“And I think there are valid arguments both ways. And I think, over time, whatever decision is made, I think the outcome will be right.”\nFormer world number one Chris Evert grasped the nettle more firmly.\n“It’s wrong, they should protect players,” Evert, who works as an analyst for broadcaster ESPN, told Reuters in an interview.\n“Not just for her but for the other women who could play her in the first round. It’s about protecting the field too.\n“It’s not like you decide to take a year off. I mean if you are forced out of the game for a specific reason, whether it be maternity or injury, you need to be protected.\n“You don’t have to put her back at number one because she left at number one but try to figure out some sort of happy medium where it’s fair for all.”\nWimbledon allows itself some ‘wiggle room’ in selecting their seeds, and are unlikely to leave the seven-times champion out of their selection for the next Grand Slam tournament in July.\nReporting by Ossian Shine; editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:48:55.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
