If the contract is rejected and “talks fail or CP not wish to bargain,” the union said “workers will exercise their right to strike after 72 hours’ advance notice.” (Reporting by Allison Lampert; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:55:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
