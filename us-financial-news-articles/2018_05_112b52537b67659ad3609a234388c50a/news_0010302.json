(NYSE:TBI) announced today its fiscal first quarter 2018 results.\nRevenue was $554 million, a decrease of 2 percent, compared to revenue of $568 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share was $0.22, an increase of 100 percent, compared to $0.11 in the fiscal first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 was $0.31, an increase of 48 percent, compared to $0.21 in the fiscal first quarter of 2017.\n“We are off to a strong start this year with earnings per share growth of 100 percent,” TrueBlue CEO Steve Cooper said. “While revenue was down modestly, growth in our PeopleScout business accelerated to over 20 percent, and we are taking the right actions to return the PeopleReady business to growth. Programs to reduce the cost of services are working, resulting in our ninth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and a three percent increase in gross profit for the quarter.”\n“We are making good progress with our digital strategy. Prospective PeopleScout clients are excited about our new talent acquisition technology, Affinix TM , and adoption of our PeopleReady mobile staffing technology, JobStack TM , is increasing. We have the right strategy to differentiate our services and position the business for profitable long-term growth.”\nTrueBlue also announced today the divestiture of PlaneTechs, a provider of skilled mechanics and technicians to the aviation sector, which was completed in March. PlaneTechs made up less than 2 percent of total company revenue and the divestiture is not expected to have a meaningful impact on operating income. The action will further enable the company to focus on larger market, higher growth, and higher profit margin opportunities.\n2018 Outlook\nThe company estimates revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2018 to range from $585 million to $600 million. It also expects net income per diluted share to range from $0.32 to $0.38. Adjusted net income per diluted share is expected to range from $0.47 to $0.53.\nManagement will discuss fiscal first quarter 2018 results on a webcast at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET), today, Monday, Apr. 30. The webcast can be accessed on TrueBlue’s website: www.trueblue.com .\nAbout TrueBlue:\nTrueBlue (NYSE: TBI) is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions that help clients achieve business growth and improve productivity, while connecting approximately 740,000 people with work in 2017.
