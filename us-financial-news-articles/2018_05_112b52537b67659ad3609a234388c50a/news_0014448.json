(TSX:AZZ) (FRA:P8AA) (OTCMKTS:PWURF) (“Azarga Uranium”) and URZ ENERGY CORP. (TSX-V:URZ) (OTCQB:URZZF) (“URZ Energy”) are pleased to announce the execution of a definitive arrangement agreement (“ Arrangement Agreement ”) pursuant to which Azarga Uranium and URZ Energy will merge to form a new US-focused in-situ recovery (“ ISR ”) uranium development company (the “ Transaction ”). The combination will be effected by way of a plan of arrangement completed under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “ Plan of Arrangement ”) wherein Azarga Uranium will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of URZ Energy for consideration of 2.0 Azarga Uranium shares for each URZ Energy share held. Upon completion of the Transaction, the board of directors of Azarga Uranium will include three appointees from each company, with Glenn Catchpole, current CEO & Director of URZ Energy, to be appointed as Chairman. Blake Steele, current President & CEO of Azarga Uranium, will continue in his role as President & CEO of Azarga Uranium.\nBlake Steele commented, “This strategic transaction brings together two companies with a similar goal of developing US-focused ISR uranium production at a time when domestic supply has emerged as a critical factor in the push for energy security. URZ Energy’s asset base and management expertise combined with ours will further bolster our growth pipeline and position us to continue to advance the development of Dewey Burdock for the benefit of all shareholders.”\nGlenn Catchpole added, “We had great success building, and ultimately selling, Uranerz in the past and now we have the opportunity to partner our assets and expertise with Azarga Uranium to create the preeminent ISR uranium developer in America. I believe the transaction is timely, with the worldwide growth in nuclear reactor construction and confidence returning to the uranium sector.”\nTransaction Highlights:\nConsolidation of uranium assets with a focus on the US: Combined Measured & Indicated (“ M&I ”) resources of 30.7 Mlbs U 3 O 8 , plus additional Inferred resources of 8.7 Mlbs U 3 O 8 , all located in the United States, including high grade M&I resources of 8.6 Mlbs U 3 O 8 at an average grade of 0.25% U 3 O 8 at the advanced permitting-stage Dewey Burdock Project. Advanced-stage permitting at Dewey Burdock: The Dewey Burdock Project has already received several key permits and is in the process of obtaining final regulatory approvals required for project construction. A NI 43-101 preliminary economic assessment on ISR production at Dewey Burdock completed in 2015 estimated annual production of approximately 1 million lbs U 3 O 8 /year. Pipeline of growth assets with continued exploration potential: The Gas Hills Project, which has been the subject of historical mining, has been recently reinterpreted by URZ Energy for its potential to be mined via ISR methods. An additional pipeline of assets located in Wyoming, including Juniper Ridge and Shirley Basin, provide further uranium optionality. Amalgamation of sector-leading ISR development and production experience: Through its management, directors and advisors, the new company will collectively possess over 100 years of experience in the exploration, development, permitting, operation and post-mining groundwater restoration of ISR uranium mines. Strategic platform for further consolidation: Strengthened platform through which to continue to evaluate and consolidate additional low-cost, domestic ISR uranium projects in the United States. Enhanced market positioning: The combined entity will have a more diversified shareholder base, along with a heightened market capitalization to broaden investor and analyst appeal.\nTransaction Details\nUnder the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, URZ Energy shareholders will receive 2.0 shares of Azarga Uranium for each share of URZ Energy held (the “ Exchange Ratio ”). In addition, outstanding options and warrants of URZ Energy will be adjusted in accordance with their terms such that the number of Azarga Uranium shares received upon exercise and the exercise price will reflect the Exchange Ratio described above.\nThe combination will be carried out by way of a court-approved Plan of Arrangement and will be subject to the approval of at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast at a special meeting of URZ Energy shareholders. Azarga Uranium shareholder approval will also be required in accordance with the requirements of the TSX. Shareholder meetings of both companies are expected to be held in late June, 2018.

Both parties have agreed to pay a termination fee of US$825,000 upon the occurrence of certain terminating events.\nCertain shareholders, including directors and officers, of each of Azarga Uranium and URZ Energy, holding a total of 37.7% and 8.2% respectively, have entered into voting and support agreements to, amongst other things, vote their shares held in favour of the Transaction. In addition, these shareholders have agreed to lock-up their shareholdings for a period of time extending until 180 days after closing of the Transaction.\nThe boards of directors of both Azarga Uranium and URZ Energy have each determined that the proposed Transaction is in the best interest of their respective shareholders, having taken into account advice from their financial and legal advisors, as applicable, and have each unanimously approved the Transaction and recommend that their respective shareholders vote in favour of the Transaction.\nFull details of the arrangement will be included in management information circulars to be filed by each of Azarga Uranium and URZ Energy with regulatory authorities and mailed to each party’s respective shareholders in accordance with applicable securities laws.
