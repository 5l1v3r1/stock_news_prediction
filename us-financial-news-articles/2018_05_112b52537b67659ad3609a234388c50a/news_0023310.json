Full year production guidance was unchanged.\nALUMINIUM: Aluminium exports from top producer China inched higher in April, as new U.S. import tariffs were offset by U.S. sanctions on Russia’s Rusal that pushed up international prices, making export more lucrative.\nALUMINIUM SPREAD: The premium for cash aluminium over the three-month contract MAL0-3 has risen to $24.25 from close to zero a week ago, suggesting tighter nearby supply.\nLME aluminium finished up 0.2 percent at $2,355 a tonne after surging to seven-year highs last month.\nZINC: Zinc ended 0.2 percent higher at $3,060 a tonne, up from a nine-month low last week. Traders said gains were technically driven after prices held above the psychologically important level of $3,000 a tonne.\nOTHER METALS: Nickel closed down 1 percent at $13,880 a tonne, lead ended 1.3 percent lower at $2,288 and tin finished down 1.4 percent at $20,925.
