The ramp of the Model 3, Tesla said in the court filing, was \"the first of its kind,\" with difficulties likely to crop up after it got underway.\nThe lawsuit filed last October seeks class action status for shareholders who bought Tesla stock between May 4, 2016 through October 6, 2017, inclusive. It said shareholders bought \"artificially inflated\" shares because Musk and other executives misled them with their statements.\nTesla made such statements during the lead-up to, and early production of, its Model 3 sedan and failed to disclose that the company was \"woefully unprepared\" for the vehicle's production, the lawsuit said.\nA hearing is scheduled for August.\nThe Tesla response chronicled disclosures of production bottlenecks the company faced in its third quarter of 2017 when it fell short of its targets.\nTesla's statements that its Model 3 production was \"on track\" in May and August of 2017 - which plaintiffs argue were false - were made before production problems began to surface, Tesla argued.\nTesla said its \"good faith belief\" in the Model 3 program is reflected in everything it has done: a $4 billion investment, the build-out of its Gigafactory battery factory in Nevada and the high-volume equipment it commissioned.
