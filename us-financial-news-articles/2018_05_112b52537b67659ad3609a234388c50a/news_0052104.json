But I'd have to see evidence of that first.\"\nThe policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, of which Harker is a nonvoting member this year, approved a quarter-point rate hike in March and is widely expected to add another in June and one more in September. Whether the committee approves a fourth hike in December remains an open question, with traders currently assigning it a 39 percent chance.\nPolicy doves, who favor lower rates, seemed to get a boost Wednesday, when minutes from the most recent FOMC meeting indicated that officials would be willing to let inflation run above the Fed's 2 percent target for a temporary period.\nHarker said he, too, would consider that, though it would depend on conditions.\n\"I don't think of it so much as a number around 2 percent, although that's part of it,\" he said during the \" Power Lunch \" interview. \"It's the acceleration or deceleration. If we're creeping up to 2 percent and we creep up to, say, 2.25 percent, that's a different story than [if] we're accelerating past 2 percent. I think we'd behave differently. At least I would as a policymaker.\"\nFed officials were in Dallas as part of a conference about technology and disruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:39:28.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
