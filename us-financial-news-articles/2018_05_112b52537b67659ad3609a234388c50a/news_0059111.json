In Q1, Box recorded a net loss per share (basic and diluted) of $0.26 and an operating loss of $35.9 million.\nNonetheless, Box now serves more than 85,000 organizations. It highlighted new or expanded relationships with the City of Philadelphia; DARPA, the Pentagon’s research arm; Hitachi; and Mitsubishi Motors.\nIn terms of outlook for Q2, Box expects revenue between $146 million and $147 million and earnings per share between $0.27 and $0.28 on a GAAP basis. For the full fiscal year 2019, it predicts revenue between $603 million and $608 million and earnings per share between $1.04 and $1.07 on a GAAP basis.
