The Boring Company CEO, speaking alongside Steven Davis, a former SpaceX engineer and Boring's project leader, said that the fare for the up-to-150 mph \"Loop\" system would be $1. It will carry people from downtown LA to the city's international airport, a distance of 11 miles, in eight minutes. Conceptual images of the transit show it taking passengers directly from the surface down to the underground facility, and then sending them on through a network of multiple connected tunnels. \"This system is designed to be more like a highway and a bunch of off-ramps and loops connecting to the highway, kind of like cars,\" Musk said. \"Almost like an autonomous underground, multi-level car systemâ€¦ that costs a dollar.\"\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk congratulates teams competing on the Hyperloop Pod Competition II at SpaceX's Hyperloop track in Hawthorne, Calif on Aug. 27, 2017. A committee of the Los Angeles City Council on April 18, 2018, approved an environmental review exemption for a Los Angeles-area tunnel that Elon Musk wants to dig to test a novel underground transportation system.

He assured people in the audience that the project would not be noisy and would reduce traffic significantly. \"Compared to a flying car, you don't have to worry about bad weather, you can't see it, hear it feel it, you're not dividing communities with lanes and we think we can make this really fun,\" Musk said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:22:19.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
