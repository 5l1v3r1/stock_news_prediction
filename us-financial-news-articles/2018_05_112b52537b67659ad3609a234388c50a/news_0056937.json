It had traded above 12.50 before the S&P&rsquo;s decision.\n* S&P&rsquo;s said the stable outlook reflected its belief that economic growth would pick up in 2018, although public debt would remain worryingly above 50 percent of GDP.\n* In March, Moody’s kept Pretoria’s investment-grade credit rating and revised its credit outlook to stable from negative. Of the big-three ratings agencies, only Fitch has yet to give its rating update.\n* Traders warned that relief for rand may be short-lived, because dollar strength and geopolitical uncertainty meant markets remained wary of riskier assets.\n* Bonds rose, with the yield on benchmark debt due in 2026 down 2 basis points at 8.43 percent.\n* Stocks were set to open higher at 0700 GMT, with the Johannesburg Stock Exchanges’ Top-40 future’s index up 0.42 percent.\n* In early results releases, sugar producer Tongaat Hulett posted full-year profit fell 37 percent. The country’s biggest landline provider, Telkom, said full-year earnings declined 18.4 percent.
