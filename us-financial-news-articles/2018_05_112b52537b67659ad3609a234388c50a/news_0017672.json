(Click on graphic to enlarge.)\nThat's the highest share since the housing bubble in the mid-2000s, when 70 percent were predicting price levels to soar.\nOptimism levels vary depending on which pocket of the country you find yourself. Nearly 80 percent of Americans in the West forecast a pricier real estate market in the next year , compared with 64 percent in the South, 58 percent in the East and 56 percent in the Midwest.\nThe biggest takeaway? \"People are very positive about the housing market,\" said Frank Newport, editor-in-chief at Gallup.\nshow chapters How to use your home as a source of cash 3:26 PM ET Wed, 2 May 2018 | 02:08 Despite rising prices, Americans want in.\nTo that point, 45 percent of non-homeowners say they plan to buy a house in the next five years.
