Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have left their country for other places in South America in a growing exodus of migrants escaping high inflation and food shortages.\nChanting anti-Maduro slogans and waving the flags of militant opposition parties Justice First and Popular Will, the protesters planned to deliver a letter to the OAS office.\n“We want free, transparent, true elections, not what’s going to happen on Sunday, a farce,” said economist Ivan Lopez, 65.\nThe abstention push has split Venezuela’s opposition and played into Maduro’s hands.\nHis main rival is a former state governor, Henri Falcon, who broke with the opposition coalition to run, arguing the only way to defeat Maduro was at the ballot box.\n“Those promoting abstention are not offering any alternative, they want a foreign military intervention, but it is we Venezuelans who have to resolve our problems,” Falcon told Reuters at a rally in Barinas state on Tuesday night.\nWhile polls are mixed and unreliable due to the anticipated larger-than-usual abstention, some do show Falcon ahead of Maduro. However, Maduro benefits from the ruling Socialist Party’s election machinery, the vote-winning power of state food handouts, and an election board controlled by loyalists.\nThe United States, European Union and various Latin American nations have already condemned Sunday’s vote conditions as unfair, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering adding oil sanctions to measures already taken to stop Venezuela issuing more debt.\nIn an interview with French TV channel France 24 released on Wednesday, Maduro condemned those international actions as “unacceptable threats” to sovereignty and insisted Venezuela’s democracy was “impeccable.” He also said there may be a referendum after the election to revoke opposition legislators in the National Assembly.\n“It seems a very good idea,” he said, of the idea being floated by the entirely pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly, which has taken over the opposition-run legislature’s functions.
