Authorities said he likely died, but were searching for him. Firefighters continued trying to fully extinguish the flames amid the debris of concrete chunks and twisted metal pipes.\nAn adjacent building caught fire, but was evacuated and no one was injured. That blaze was brought under control relatively quickly, Sao Paulo Fire Brigade Lieutenant André Elias told Globo TV.\nThe cause of the fire was unknown and there could be more victims, Elias said. Three people were unaccounted for, he said.\nFirefighters try to extinguish a fire at a building in downtown Sao Paulo, Brazil May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker The abandoned former office building had been occupied irregularly seven years ago and some 150 people lived in the lower 10 floors, Globo reported.\nSao Paulo state Governor Marcio Franca, at the scene, told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper it was a “tragedy foretold.”\nThe city and state governments have been working for years to forcibly remove squatters from buildings in central Sao Paulo, with plans for revitalizing the area.\nFranca said about 150 buildings in the region were occupied by organized groups of squatters, who have pressured the government for years to provide housing for the city’s homeless.\nSlideshow (14 Images) The governor said it was legally difficult to force people to evacuate the old and decaying buildings.\n“There is not even a minimal condition for people to live in there,” Franca said. “People live there in desperation. This was a tragedy foretold.”\nReporting by Anthony Boadle and Brad Brooks; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T12:56:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
