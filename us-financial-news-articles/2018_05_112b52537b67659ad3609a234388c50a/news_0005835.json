He did not name the companies.\nThe government crackdown on debt has had a stark impact in China. HNA has been on a selling spree this year to raise funds, while Wanda offloaded billions of dollars of tourism and entertainment assets last year to reduce its debt load.\n“Rational investment means companies need to follow market rules and China’s industry policy,” added Qian. “If everyone fights for one meaningless, expensive, and low-return investment target, and brings financing risks, that would be irrational.”\nFosun, co-founded by China’s self-styled Warren Buffett Guo Guangchang, has escaped Beijing’s battle on debt relatively unscathed. The tourism unit is now looking for investment targets in Asia, Europe and the Americas, Qian said.\nThe unit, an important profit growth driver for Fosun, controls French resort operator Club Med, and has a stake in British travel firm Thomas Cook Group.\nQian added he wanted to make the Sanya resort a one-stop-shop for the country’s deep-pocketed middle class tourists looking for a getaway as the world’s second-largest economy shifts to a consumption-driven economy.\nFosun spun off the tourism unit in 2016, paving the way for a potential initial public offering, which Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported could raise at least $500 million.\nAfter the spin off, a restructuring of the newly created tourism group has continued. The unit may also take on other related assets to gain assets along the whole industry chain of the vacation market, he added.\nQian added any listing plans would depend on capital market conditions and the restructuring.\nFosun’s annual profit jumped 28.2 percent to a record high in 2017, its fastest growth in four years, on the back of stronger growth from its core operations and successes in exiting and listing several investments.\nOn the company’s outlook, Qian said he felt there was little competition facing the firm. “If you are at the forefront of an industry, you have few competitors. I think we have no competitor, except us,” he said.
