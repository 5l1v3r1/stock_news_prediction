AAP/Pool/Jason McCawley/via REUTERS He may have had the word “delicieux” in mind, which, though sounding similar to “delicious,” would better translate into “lovely” or “delightful.”\nWhile more often used to describe a pastry or a meal, the word “delicieux” can also describe a person, even if it is a somewhat old-fashioned usage.\nThough Macron speaks better English than several of his predecessors and often speaks the language when abroad, his only experience of living in an English-speaking country is six months in the French embassy in Nigeria.\nPresident of France Emmanuel Macron meets Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy Turnbull at the Sydney Opera House, Australia May 1, 2018. AAP/Mick Tsikas/via REUTERS It is not the first time a stray comment - in this case, unintentional - on a high-profile visit has overshadowed more official business.\nLast year, U.S. President Donald Trump praised French first lady Brigitte Macron for being in “such good shape” on a state visit to France.\nAdditional reporting by Ingrid Melander and Michel Rose in Paris; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T12:34:04.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
