(NYSE: JWN) today reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018 of $0.51, compared with the first quarter ended April 29, 2017 of $0.37, which included a debt refinancing charge of $0.06.\nTotal Company net sales increased 5.8 percent for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018 compared with the quarter ended April 29, 2017. This reflected an increase of approximately 250 basis points primarily due to the shift of a Nordstrom Rewards loyalty event into the first quarter relative to the second quarter last year. Comparable sales for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018 increased 0.6 percent, compared with the 13-week period ended May 6, 2017.\nThe Company continues to invest in new market opportunities and digital capabilities to drive customer engagement and market share gains. During the quarter, the Company made the following achievements in executing its growth plans:\nThe Company reached a significant milestone in its history with the opening of the Nordstrom Men's Store in New York City. The Company expanded its presence in Canada with the introduction of Nordstrom Rack, opening three stores in the Toronto and Calgary markets. In executing its digital strategy, the Company increased sales enabled through digital capabilities by 18 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2017. Digitally enabled sales represented 29 percent of first quarter sales, up from 25 percent a year ago. Sales from Nordstrom Rewards customers represented 53 percent of first quarter sales, compared with 47 percent a year ago.\nFIRST QUARTER SUMMARY\nFirst quarter net earnings were $87 million compared with $63 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. Results in 2017 included an interest expense charge of $18 million related to a debt refinancing. Earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") were $153 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, compared with $151 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales, during the same period in fiscal 2017. In Full-price, which consists of Nordstrom U.S. full-line stores, Nordstrom.com , the Canadian operation, Trunk Club, Jeffrey and Nordstrom Local, comparable sales increased 0.7 percent. The top-ranking merchandise categories were Kids' Apparel and Men's Apparel. In Off-price, which consists of Nordstrom U.S. Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook and Last Chance clearance stores, comparable sales increased 0.4 percent. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.1 percent decreased 21 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2017. This reflected higher occupancy expenses related to U.S. and Canada Rack openings in addition to planned pre-opening expenses associated with the Nordstrom Men's Store NYC. The Company ended the first quarter in a good inventory position with net sales growth exceeding a decline in inventory. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 32.3 percent increased 32 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2017, primarily due to planned pre-opening expenses associated with the Nordstrom Men's Store NYC. The Company's rate performance reflected an improvement relative to recent historical trends driven by productivity gains in technology, supply chain and marketing. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of its common stock for $13 million. A total capacity of $401 million remains available under its existing share repurchase board authorization. The actual timing, price, manner and amounts of future share repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules.\nEXPANSION UPDATE\nTo date in fiscal 2018, the Company opened eight stores and closed one store.

Results beginning in the first quarter of 2018 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted. Also beginning in 2018, we aligned our sales presentation with how we view the results of our operations internally and how our customers view us, by our Full-price and Off-price businesses.\nOur Full-price business includes our Nordstrom U.S. full-line stores, Nordstrom.com , the Canadian operation, Trunk Club, Jeffrey and Nordstrom Local. Our Off-price business includes Nordstrom U.S. Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook and Last Chance clearance stores. The following table summarizes net sales and comparable sales within our business for the first quarter ended 2018 compared with the same period in fiscal 2017:\nQuarter Ended May 5, 2018 2 April 29, 2017 Net sales by business 1 : Full-price $ 2,240 $ 2,156 Off-price 1,229 1,152 Other — (29 ) Total net sales $ 3,469 $ 3,279 Comparable sales increase (decrease) by business: Full-price 0.7 % (2.9 %) Off-price 0.4 % 2.3 % Total Company 0.6 % (0.8 %) Digitally enabled sales as % of total net sales 3 29 % 25 % 1 We present our sales for 2018 and 2017 to align with how management views our results internally, including presenting 2018 under the new revenue recognition guidance and allocating our sales returns reserve to our Full-price and Off-price business. For 2017 and prior, Other primarily included unallocated sales return, in-transit and loyalty related adjustments necessary to reconcile sales by business to total net sales.\n2 Total net sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 250 basis points due to the shift of a Nordstrom Rewards loyalty event into the first quarter relative to the second quarter and the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Full-price and Off-price net sales increased approximately 200 basis points and 100 basis points for the same impacts as total company, in addition to allocating sales return reserves to the Full-price and Off-price businesses.\n3 Digitally enabled sales are online sales and digitally assisted store sales which include Buy Online, Pickup in Store (“BOPUS”), Reserve Online, Try on in Store (Store Reserve) and Style Board, a digital selling tool.\nNORDSTROM, INC.\nRETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)\n(unaudited; dollar amounts in millions)\nWe believe that ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital we have invested in our business to generate returns. ROIC adjusts our operating leases as if they met the criteria for capital leases or we had purchased the properties. This provides additional supplemental information that reflects the investment in our off-balance sheet operating leases, controls for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors and provides investors and credit agencies with another way to comparably evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our capital investments over time. In addition, we incorporate ROIC into our executive incentive measures and it is an important component of shareholders’ return over the long term.\nWe define ROIC as our adjusted net operating profit after tax divided by our average invested capital using the trailing 12-month average. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. Estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases and average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases are not calculated in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution of our results as reported under GAAP. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to ROIC is return on assets.\nFor the 12 fiscal months ended May 5, 2018, our ROIC increased to 9.9% compared with 8.7% for the 12 fiscal months ended April 29, 2017. Results for the prior period were negatively impacted by approximately 320 basis points due to the Trunk Club non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the components of ROIC and return on assets:\n12 Fiscal Months Ended May 5, 2018 April 29, 2017 Net earnings $ 461 $ 371 Add: income tax expense 1 351 341 Add: interest expense 123 140 Earnings before interest and income tax expense 935 852 Add: rent expense, net 254 212 Less: estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases 2 (135 ) (113 ) Adjusted net operating profit 1,054 951 Less: estimated income tax expense (456 ) (436 ) Adjusted net operating profit after tax $ 598 $ 515 Average total assets $ 8,067 $ 7,977 Less: average non-interest-bearing current liabilities 3 (3,306 ) (3,013 ) Less: average deferred property incentives and deferred rent liability 3 (642 ) (644 ) Add: average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases 2 1,893 1,570 Average invested capital $ 6,012 $ 5,890 Return on assets 4 5.7 % 4.7 % ROIC 4 9.9 % 8.7 % 1 Results for the 12 fiscal months ended May 5, 2018 include a $42 impact related to the Tax Act.\n2 Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. The asset base is calculated based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base. The asset base for each month is calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases.\n3 Balances associated with our deferred rent liability have been classified as long-term liabilities as of January 28, 2017.\n4 Results for the 12 fiscal months ended April 29, 2017 include the $197 impact of the Trunk Club non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2016, which negatively impacted the prior period return on assets by approximately 240 basis points and ROIC by approximately 320 basis points.\nNORDSTROM, INC.\nADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)\n(unaudited; dollar amounts in millions)\nAdjusted Debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (\"EBITDAR\") is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and operate with an efficient capital structure. In evaluating our debt levels, this measure provides a reflection of our credit worthiness that could impact our credit rating and borrowing costs. We also have a debt covenant that requires an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of no more than four times. As of May 5, 2018, our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR was 2.6, and as of April 29, 2017, it was 2.3.\nAdjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR and debt to net earnings:\n2018 1 2017 1 Debt $ 2,736 $ 2,742 Add: estimated capitalized operating lease liability 2 2,029 1,700 Adjusted Debt $ 4,765 $ 4,442 Net earnings $ 461 $ 371 Add: income tax expense 351 341 Add: interest expense, net 116 138 Earnings before interest and income taxes 928 850 Add: depreciation and amortization expenses 674 649 Add: rent expense, net 254 212 Add: non-cash acquisition-related charges 3 1 207 Adjusted EBITDAR $ 1,857 $ 1,918 Debt to Net Earnings 4 5.9 7.4 Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR 2.6 2.3 1 The components of Adjusted Debt are as of May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017, while the components of Adjusted EBITDAR are for the 12 months ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017.\n2 Based upon the estimated lease liability as of the end of the period, calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property.\n3 Non-cash acquisition-related charges for the 12 months ended April 29, 2017 included the goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club.\n4 Results for the period ended April 29, 2017 include the $197 impact of the Trunk Club goodwill impairment charge, which approximates 260 basis points.\nNORDSTROM, INC.\nFREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)\n(unaudited; amounts in millions)\nFree Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. For the quarter ended May 5, 2018, we had Free Cash Flow of ($130) compared with ($85) for the first quarter ended 2017.\nBeginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we no longer reduce free cash flow by cash dividends paid. We believe that no longer reducing free cash flow by dividends paid is more reflective of our operating performance and more consistent with the way we manage our business, how our peers calculate free cash flows, and prevailing industry practice. Prior period Free Cash Flow financial measures have been recast to conform with current period presentation.\nFree Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nQuarter Ended May 5, 2018 April 29, 2017 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (28 ) $ 89 Less: capital expenditures (129 ) (153 ) Add (Less): change in cash book overdrafts 27 (21 ) Free Cash Flow $ (130 ) $ (85 )\nNORDSTROM, INC.\nADJUSTED EBITDA (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)\n(unaudited; amounts in millions)\nAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is our key financial metric to reflect our view of cash flow from net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA excludes significant items which are non-operating in nature in order to evaluate our core operating performance against prior periods and increase comparability with our peers. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings. As of May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $301 and $293.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net earnings, overall change in cash or liquidity of the business as a whole. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies.
