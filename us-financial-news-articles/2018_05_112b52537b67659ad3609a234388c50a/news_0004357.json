Refer to the section entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this release.\nNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ingevity Corporation (NYSE: NGVT) today reported first quarter net sales of $235.2 million, representing an increase of 7.6 percent versus $218.5 million in the prior year’s first quarter. Net income was $35.8 million, an increase of 55.7 percent versus $23.0 million in net income in the previous year’s quarter. The first quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, (EBITDA) of $67.1 million were up 33.7 percent versus first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $50.2 million. Diluted adjusted earnings per share were $0.79 excluding, net of tax, acquisition and other related costs of $0.08 per share and restructuring and other income of $0.01 per share. Ingevity’s first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.5 percent was up 550 basis points from the prior year’s first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.0 percent.\n“We’re off to a great start, in line with our expectations,” said Michael Wilson, Ingevity’s president and CEO. “We drove a 34 percent jump in adjusted EBITDA on an 8 percent revenue increase. This reflects an improvement in market dynamics and product demand, strong execution and cost discipline.”\nWilson attributed the results primarily to volume growth resulting from higher sales of the company’s Performance Materials segment’s activated carbon products to the global automotive market. In addition, sales in Performance Chemicals benefitted from higher sales to the oilfield services and pavement industries, as well as the company’s recent acquisition of Georgia-Pacific’s (G-P) pine chemicals business. These revenue increases were partially offset by declines in sales to industrial specialties applications as the company shifted available product to higher value-added applications.\n“Our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven primarily by volume gains, though price and mix benefits and lower raw material costs – specifically for crude tall oil, or CTO – also contributed significantly,” he said.\nPerformance Chemicals\nFirst quarter 2018 sales in the Performance Chemicals segment were $139.7 million, up $4.6 million, or 3.4 percent, versus the first quarter 2017. Segment operating profit was $18.7 million, up $8.3 million, or 79.8 percent, versus the prior year quarter segment operating profit. Segment operating margin rose 570 basis points to 13.4 percent. Segment EBITDA were $24.9 million, up $9.2 million, or 58.6 percent, versus the prior year quarter segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA margin rose 620 basis points to 17.8 percent.\n“U.S. rig count growth boosted sales to the oilfield industry and adoption of our pavement technologies in South America and Asia drove higher sales in our Performance Chemicals segment,” said Wilson. “In addition, sales for a partial quarter from our acquisition of the G-P pine chemicals business helped drive growth.” Wilson said that sales in industrial specialties applications declined as products were shifted to higher-margin uses in oilfield and pavement rather than from a decline in demand.\n“Despite modest revenue growth for the segment, our segment EBITDA were up 59 percent due to improved prices and product mix, lower raw materials costs – including for CTO – and our G-P pine chemicals acquisition,” he added.\nPerformance Materials\nFirst quarter 2018 sales in the Performance Materials segment were $95.5 million, up $12.1 million, or 14.5 percent, versus the first quarter 2017. Segment operating profit was $36.9 million, up $7.4 million, or 25.1 percent, versus the prior year quarter segment operating profit. Segment operating margin rose 320 basis points to 38.6 percent. Segment EBITDA were $42.2 million, up $7.7 million, or 22.3 percent, versus the prior year segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA margin rose 280 basis points to 44.2 percent.\n“Adoption of Ingevity’s U.S. Tier 3 and LEV III emission solutions, particularly our ‘honeycomb’ scrubber products, by automotive customers once again fueled growth in our Performance Materials segment,” Wilson said. “Our base canister carbon revenue also continued to grow – albeit more moderately – despite reduced North American auto production in the quarter.”\nOutlook\nIngevity narrowed and raised the mid-point for its fiscal year 2018 guidance for sales from between $1.07 billion and $1.13 billion to between $1.10 billion and $1.13 billion. It also narrowed and raised the mid-point for its guidance for 2018 adjusted EBITDA from between $285 million and $305 million to between $293 million and $307 million.\n“Three months in, we feel we have good line of sight on the year,” Wilson said. “We’re executing our businesses according to plan. We are focused on efficiently integrating the G-P pine chemicals acquisition, capturing the benefits of improving market conditions in Performance Chemicals, preparing for growing global demand in Performance Materials, and turning in another strong performance in 2018.”\nIngevity: Purify, Protect and Enhance\nIngevity provides specialty chemicals and high-performance carbon materials and technologies that purify, protect and enhance the world around us.

Definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP are included in the financial schedules accompanying this news release, under the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nA reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA as projected for 2018 is not provided. Ingevity does not forecast net income as it cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income. These components, net of tax, include additional separation costs associated with the separation from WestRock; further restructuring and other income (charges); acquisition and other related costs in connection with the acquisition of Georgia-Pacific’s pine chemical business; and revisions due to future guidance and assessment of U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, discrete tax items could drive variability in our projected effective tax rate. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures. Further, in the future, other items with similar characteristics to those currently included in adjusted EBITDA, that have a similar impact on comparability of periods, and which are not known at this time, may exist and impact adjusted EBITDA.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Restricted cash is included within \"Prepaid and Other Current Assets\" within the consolidated balance sheets.\nIngevity Corporation\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIngevity has presented certain financial measures, defined below, which have not been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business, because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.\nIngevity uses the following non-GAAP measures:\nAdjusted earnings (loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Ingevity stockholders plus restructuring and other (income) charges, separation costs, acquisition and other related costs and the income tax expense (benefit) on those items, less the benefit from U.S. Tax Reform.\nDiluted adjusted earnings (loss) per share is defined as diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to Ingevity stockholders plus restructuring and other (income) charges, net per share, separation costs per share, acquisition and other related costs per share and the income tax expense (benefit) per share on those items, less the per share tax benefit from U.S. Tax Reform.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus provision for income taxes, interest expense, , restructuring and other (income) charges, separation costs and acquisition and other related costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Sales\nSegment EBITDA is defined as segment operating profit plus .\nSegment EBITDA Margin is defined as Segment EBITDA divided by Net Segment Sales.\nThe Company also uses the above financial measures as the primary measures of profitability used by managers of the business and its segments. In addition, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are useful measures because they exclude the effects of financing and investment activities as well as non-operating activities. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP and investors should consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are set forth within the following pages.\nA reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA as projected for 2018 is not provided. Ingevity does not forecast net income as we cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income. These components, net of tax, include additional separation costs associated with the separation from WestRock; further restructuring and other income (charges); acquisition-related charges in connection with the acquisition of Georgia-Pacific’s pine chemical business; and revisions due to future guidance and assessment of U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, discrete tax items could drive variability in our projected effective tax rate. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures.
