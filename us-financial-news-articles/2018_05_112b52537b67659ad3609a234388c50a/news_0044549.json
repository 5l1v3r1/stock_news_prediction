It was the second of the season for Zobrist.\nMahle was pulled after six innings, having allowed four runs on seven hits. He walked two and struck out six.\nDarvish limited the Reds to two hits in his six innings. He walked three and struck out seven in his 94-pitch outing, during which he also hit two batters.\nFour Cubs pitchers combined for 13 strikeouts in the game.\nThe Cubs tacked on two runs in the seventh against the Cincinnati bullpen, with an error setting the stage for Albert Almora Jr.’s sacrifice fly and Anthony Rizzo’s RBI single for a 6-1 lead. Both runs were unearned.\nSchwarber was ejected by home plate umpire John Tumpane for disputing a called third strike that ended the seventh. It was his second consecutive strikeout after two hits, including the homer.\nBaez had three hits and Almora joined Schwarber with two for the Cubs, who have won nine of their last 13 games.\nZobrist scored two of Chicago’s six runs in the finale of a six-game trip, during which the Cubs won four of six.\nJoey Votto had two singles for the Reds, who totaled just three hits while losing for the fifth time in their last seven games.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:37:04.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
