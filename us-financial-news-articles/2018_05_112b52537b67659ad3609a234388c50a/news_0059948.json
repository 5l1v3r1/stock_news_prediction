We believe it will help improve trust amongst stakeholders in the industry,” Addo-Kufuor told a meeting of mining and power businesses in the capital.\n“PMMC officials now have permanent access to our gold rooms during gold pours for a first-hand view of the processes, and to take assay samples for analysis and comparison and participate in pre-shipment sealing and processes,” he said.\nGhana earned $5.78 billion (£4.3 billion) from exports of the metal last year, up 17.6 percent on 2016, central bank data showed.\nAkufo-Addo, who took office last year, has said about $5 billion worth of revenues from gold exports to the United Arab Emirates are unaccounted for.\nIndustry watchers say the unreported shipments represent smuggled gold produced by artisanal miners from Ghana and neighbouring countries.\nThe government has yet to lift a ban on small-scale mining as part of a general clamp-down on illegal miners last year.
