Under the terms of the agreement, valued at approximately $555 million, RPX shareholders will only receive $10.50 in cash per RPX share owned. The consideration is significantly lower than at least one analyst’s estimated value of $16.00.\nIf you are an affected investor, and you want to learn more about the investigation or if you have information that you believe would be helpful to our investigation of the fairness of the proposed transaction, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com or by calling (888) 809-2750. There is no cost or fee to you.\nThe investigation centers on whether RPX’s Board of Directors is acting in the shareholders’ best interests, whether the board considered alternatives to the acquisition, and whether the board has employed an adequate process to review and act on the proposed transaction. Notably, at least one analyst with Yahoo! Finance believes the true inherent value of RPX could be as high as $16.00 per share.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation and shareholder rights advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation matters, including claims of investor and stockholder fraud, shareholder derivative suits, and securities class actions.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005566/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51805614&newsitemid=20180514005566&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Briscoe+Law+Firm%2C+PLLC&index=2&md5=ffa953372d788e621a4bc31aaad52a6b", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005566/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebriscoelawfirm.com&esheet=51805614&newsitemid=20180514005566&lan=en-US&anchor=Willie+Briscoe&index=1&md5=f46e078df112da5bd7ed9f1bb661e7da"], "published": "2018-05-14T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T01:05:11.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
