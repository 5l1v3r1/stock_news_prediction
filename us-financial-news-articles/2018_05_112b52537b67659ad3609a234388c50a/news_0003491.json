It closed 2017 at 2.41 percent. Treasuries are considered risk-free because they are backed by the U.S. government. Therefore a good place to park money during uncertain and/or volatile market activity.”\nOverall, U.S.-based taxable bonds attracted $916 million in the week ended Wednesday, marking the group’s eighth straight week of inflows, Lipper said. U.S.-based money market funds, whose yields have also climbed higher, attracted $844 million in the week ended Wednesday, their second straight week of inflows.\nEquity flows have been choppy in recent weeks, underscoring investor concerns that economic growth has moderated and that future interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve could slow growth.\nU.S.-based equity mutual funds posted outflows of $1.59 billion in the week ended Wednesday, following the previous week’s outflows of $1.9 billion, Lipper data showed. U.S.-based equity exchange-traded funds - generally believed to represent the investment behavior of institutional investors, including fast-moving hedge funds - attracted inflows of $2.7 billion in the week ended Wednesday, marking their fourth consecutive week of inflows.\nU.S.-based emerging market equity funds posted outflows of $611 million for the week, their first weekly outflow of 2018, according to Lipper data.\nReporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and James Dalgleish\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
