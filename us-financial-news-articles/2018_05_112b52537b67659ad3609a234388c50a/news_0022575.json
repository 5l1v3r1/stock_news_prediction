He is a fighter, came out of nowhere, when Man United weren’t in a good state, had to do some tough things there to sort the team environment out.\n“He did that, and created something absolutely incredible. (It) was great to see him fighting.”\nWhen asked what he learned from Ferguson’s management style, Jones said: “Stick to what you believe in.”\nEarlier in the day, Jones picked seven new players in his 34-man England squad to tour South Africa for a three-test series next month.
