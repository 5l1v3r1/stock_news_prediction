REUTERS/Peter Powell With Palace not at their sharpest in a nervy opening half, it took the quality of Shaqiri to break the deadlock as he began a promising move with a fine cross-field ball, then tempted Ruben Loftus-Cheek into a clumsy challenge 23 metres out.\nThe Swiss international’s curled free kick took a slight diversion off Loftus-Cheek in the Palace wall to give Stoke a lifeline.\nYet the home side increasingly retreated as Palace began to swarm over them after the interval, with McArthur, overlapping on the left, slotting home an excellent left-footed finish after the visitors broke from deep in their own half.\nA draw would not realistically have been enough to save Stoke but their fate was sealed when Shawcross, trying to clear his lines, diverted the ball straight into the path of the charging full back Van Aanholt.\n“The goal was my fault. Sometimes you make mistakes and they cost you,” said Shawcross.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The win sealed Palace’s safety, a remarkable achievement for former England manager Hodgson, who had to pull off a considerable feat of escapology after the Eagles’ desperate start to the season under Frank de Boer.\nReporting by Ian Chadband, ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T17:04:00.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
