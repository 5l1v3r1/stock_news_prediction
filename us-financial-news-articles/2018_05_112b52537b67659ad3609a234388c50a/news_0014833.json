REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Files Experts have been divided over the existence of a concealed chamber behind the tomb, which some believe could be the final resting place of the lost Queen, Nefertiti.\nInternational interest in Nefertiti is high. She died in the 14th century B.C. and is thought to be Tutankhamen’s stepmother, and any confirmation of her final resting place would be the most remarkable Egyptian archaeological find this century.\nDiscovery of Nefertiti, whose chiselled cheekbones and regal beauty were immortalized in a 3,300-year-old bust now in a Berlin museum, would shed fresh light on what remains a mysterious period of Egyptian history.\nThe Egyptian Antiquities Ministry said in a statement that months of studies by Italy’s Polytechnic University in Turin has shown that no such chamber exists.\n“The studies ... have shown that no chambers exist, or even an indication of any threshold or door frames, which contradicts the previous theory that had assumed the existence of passages or chambers adjacent or inside the burial chamber of King Tutankhamen,” the statement Quote: d Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, as saying.\nIn 2015, the antiquities minister said that there was a “90 percent” chance that something was behind the walls of Tutankhamen’s tomb after an initial reading of radar imaging suggested such a chamber existed.\nReporting by Sameh El Khatib, writing by Sami Aboudi, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T21:21:51.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
