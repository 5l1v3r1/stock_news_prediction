The $114 billion market is growing by about 18 percent a year, according to the Global Impact Investing Network, a U.S.-based non profit.\n“I’m one of the people that believes that, by 2020, impact investing will be the normal way, that investors will expect a social or environmental outcome with their money, as well as a financial one,” said Woods, who started out as a banker.\nHis previous role was as head of Oikocredit, a social investor that funds microfinance and fair trade organizations.\n“Impact investment deals on environment and climate change will attract international private sector institutional investors, so help to share the burden facing the New Zealand taxpayer,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nWoods gave the example of the consulting agency Envirostrat, which is exploring whether investors could help to clean up the Waikato, New Zealand’s longest river, which has been polluted by run off from nearby dairy farms.\nEnvirostrat believes that investors will see an opportunity if clean water becomes more valuable because of scarcity.\nWith Woods on board, the NAB will join the 15-member Global Impact Investment Steering Group, an independent organization set up in 2015 to catalyze the sector, which brings together the worlds of finance, business and philanthropy.\nIt aims to make measurable impact “a deliberate driver in every investment and business decision affecting people and the planet”, it said on its website.\nAside from the environment, Woods reeled off a list of other social challenges he believes impact investing could address: affordable housing, child poverty, health issues and education for minorities, in particular in Maori communities.\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion.
