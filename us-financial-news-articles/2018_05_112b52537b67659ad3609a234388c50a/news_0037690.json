REUTERS/Michael Dalder “We are striving to keep group pre-tax profit (margins) sustainably above 10 percent,” Peter said in a interview in the newspaper. “For this year, that means a result of well over 10 billion euros.”\nBMW made record profits last year but delivered a slightly weaker showing in the first quarter as unfavorable exchange rate effects weighed.\nThe company has set an operating margin target of 8-10 percent in its core car business for this year. The group margin target of more than 10 percent would be accorded equal weight in future, Peter told Handelsblatt.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine.
