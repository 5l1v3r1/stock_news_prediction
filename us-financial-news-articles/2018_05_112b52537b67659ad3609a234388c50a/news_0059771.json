(though) it is most likely that Italy will stay in the euro zone,” said Wansleben.\nWhile he believed Italy could avert the worst-case scenario, the political crisis might nevertheless impair the capacity of the euro zone to work effectively.\nHe also said German companies were concerned about the effects of U.S. sanctions against Iran after President Donald Trump announced he was ditching an international nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic and reinstating sanctions.\nReporting by Gernot Heller; Writing by Michelle Martin and Madeline Chambers; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:23:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
