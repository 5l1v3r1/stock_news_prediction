(the “Company” or “STEP”) is pleased to announce its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This news release should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), condensed unaudited consolidated interim financial statements and notes thereto as at and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the MD&A, Annual Information Form and audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2017. The above documents are available at www.stepenergyservices.com or on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nQ1 2018 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING Highlights\nA hallmark of the first three months of 2018 was STEP’s announcement of the U.S.$275 million strategic acquisition of Tucker Energy Services Holdings, Inc. (“Tucker”). The transaction provides an efficient entry into the U.S. fracturing market, reduces commodity concentration risk and increases capital allocation flexibility. In addition to the acquisition, the Company continued to post strong performance, including increased operating days across all business segments, as well as record first quarter revenue.\nGenerated consolidated revenue of $187.6 million compared to $118.0 million during the same period of 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth in deployed equipment, as well as improved utilization and pricing. Revenue per operating day for fracturing services of $247,779 increased by 13% relative to the same period in 2017, while coiled tubing revenue per operating day increased 6% to $45,102. Operating days increased 43% for fracturing and 47% for coiled tubing over the first quarter of 2017, largely due to additional deployed equipment combined with strong demand for STEP’s services. Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 98% over the same period in 2017 to $41.8 million (or 22%), primarily attributable to strong utilization of an expanded fleet, cost control and operating efficiencies. Generated net income of $18.4 million, a 105% increase over $9.0 million for the same period in 2017. Exited the quarter with working capital of $128.1 million (including cash and cash equivalents of $40.3 million) and an undrawn $100.0 million credit facility.\nHighlights SUBSEQUENT TO QUARTER END\nOn April 2, 2018 STEP closed the Tucker acquisition, increasing our geographic diversification with an efficient and strategic entry into the U.S. fracturing market in key high-growth basins, including access to existing long-tenured clients holding large acreage positions and multi-year drilling inventories. The acquisition was funded with a combination of cash on hand and net proceeds from a previously announced equity financing, with the balance funded from borrowings under the new credit facilities. Commensurate with the closing of the Tucker transaction, STEP secured a new $330 million revolving syndicated credit facility, a $10 million operating facility and a U.S.$7.5 million operating facility. The new credit facilities mature April 2, 2021 and may be extended for a period of up to 3 years with syndicate approval.\n(1) See Non-IFRS Measures. “Adjusted EBITDA” is a financial measure not presented in accordance with IFRS and is equal to net income before finance costs, depreciation and amortization, loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, impairment, current and deferred income tax, share‐based compensation, transaction costs, unrealized foreign exchange forward contracts (gain) loss and foreign exchange (gain) loss.\nConsolidated highlights\nThe Company’s consolidated first quarter financial and operating highlights are presented below.\nFINANCIAL Three months ended March 31, ($000s except percentages, shares and per share amounts) 2018 2017 Consolidated revenue $ 187,593 $ 117,984 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders $ 18,416 $ 8,992 Per share-basic $ 0.30 $ 0.18 Per share-diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.18 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 41,780 $ 21,140 Adjusted EBITDA % (1) 22 % 18 % OPERATIONAL Three months ended March 31, ($000s except per day, days, units, and HP) 2018 2017 Total fracturing operating days (1) 515 361 Fracturing revenue per operating day $ 247,779 $ 219,781 Fracturing capacity (HP): Average active HP 214,333 133,500 Exit active HP 225,000 145,000 Total HP (2) 297,500 297,500 Proppant pumped (tonnes) 209,000 147,900 Total coiled tubing operating days (1) 1,330 906 Coiled tubing revenue per operating day $ 45,102 $ 42,652 Coiled tubing capacity: Average active coiled tubing units 20 14 Exit active coiled tubing units 21 14 Total coiled tubing units 21 16 Capital expenditures $ 24,597 $ 20,943 (1) An operating day is defined as any coiled tubing and fracturing work that is performed in a 24 hour period, exclusive of support equipment.\n(2) Represents total owned HP, of which 225,000 HP is currently deployed and the remainder of which requires certain maintenance and refurbishment.\nBALANCE SHEET\n($000s except shares and per share amounts) At as March 31, As at December 31, 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 40,296 $ 36,859 Working capital $ 128,071 $ 121,032 Total assets $ 579,892 $ 533,845 Total long-term financial liabilities $ 7,311 $ 8,049 Shares outstanding Basic 60,434,971 60,309,738 Weighted average shares – basic 60,420,318 56,528,016 Weighted average shares – diluted 62,492,198 57,752,867 (1) See Non-IFRS Measures. “Adjusted EBITDA” is a financial measure not presented in accordance with IFRS and is equal to net income before finance costs, depreciation and amortization, loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, impairment, current and deferred income tax, share‐based compensation, transaction costs, unrealized foreign exchange forward contracts (gain) loss and foreign exchange (gain) loss.\nOperations Review\nSTEP’s first quarter results reflect continued robust operational performance and expanded capacity with the deployment of an additional fracturing spread in Canada and two coiled tubing spreads in the U.S. Extreme weather conditions and third party sand delivery interruptions impacted some operations during the quarter, yet demand for STEP’s services drove higher equipment utilization relative to the same period in 2017. This stronger demand contributed to a 46% increase in total combined operating days relative to Q1 of 2017 and supported stronger pricing outcomes. Cost and operating efficiency improvements across the organization supported STEP generating record first quarter Adjusted EBITDA 1 .\nCanadian Segment\nSTEP took delivery of its eighth fracturing spread during the first quarter of 2018. At quarter-end, the Company’s Canadian operations were comprised of 297,500 fracturing HP, of which eight fracturing spreads representing 225,000 HP and 13 purpose-built coiled tubing spreads were all staffed for 24-hour operations. Since the end of Q1 2017 STEP has activated 80,000 HP along with three deep capacity coiled tubing spreads.\nThe combined impact of additional capacity, improved utilization and higher pricing resulted in revenue increasing 50% during the first quarter of 2018 over the comparable period in 2017. Jobs that combined STEP’s coiled tubing and fracturing services represented approximately 32% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018, higher than the 27% represented in Q4 2017, a reflection of the increased value realized by clients leveraging our integrated services.\nThe Canadian segment generated first quarter Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $34.2 million (or 21%) versus $20.4 million (or 19%) in the comparable period the prior year, despite being impacted by extreme weather and issues with sand delivery. The improvements are primarily attributable to improved pricing and utilization over an expanded fleet of deployed equipment, supported by cost containment measures and operating efficiencies.\nU.S. Segment\nAs at March 31, 2018, STEP had eight active coiled tubing spreads in the U.S. servicing an expanding client list in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in Texas and the Haynesville shale in Louisiana. STEP plans to take delivery of our ninth U.S. coiled tubing spread late in the second quarter, and two additional coiled tubing spreads during the second half of the year.\nContinuing demand in completions activity in the U.S. since Q1 2017 has allowed STEP to deploy four deep-capacity coiled tubing spreads, including two in Q1 2018. Compared to the same period in 2017, revenue increased 174% in Q1 2018 supported by our growing client base and strong demand for units across all operating districts. This was complemented by a strengthening U.S. dollar which amplified realized corporate revenue per day by approximately 3%.\nThe U.S. segment generated Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $7.6 million (or 34%) compared to $0.7 million (or 8%) in Q1 2017. The increase is attributable to strong utilization over a larger fleet of deployed equipment, improved pricing fundamentals and operating efficiencies.\noutlook\nSTEP’s completions commitments remain strong through Q2 2018, although management is anticipating that work deferrals may occur stemming from extended wet conditions related to the high amounts of winter snowfall. Through the back half of 2018, STEP’s outlook is positive with expectations of strong utilization for current active equipment.\nManagement anticipates Canadian drilling activity in 2018 will remain more focused on oil and liquids-rich gas plays given the strengthening of oil prices and the impact of continued weakness in natural gas prices in Canada. This reinforces STEP’s strategy to construct fit-for-purpose equipment to target shallow, oil-weighted areas where capital programs are anticipated to remain intact or expand. Should client drilling budgets expand, management anticipates there could be a shortage of pressure pumping equipment to service the incremental demand in Canada.\nIn the U.S., the market for completions activity remains robust and client inquiries continue to be supportive of deploying additional equipment to meet demand. The Company anticipates that our coiled tubing and recently acquired fracturing assets will experience strong utilization through 2018. Management believes that the impact of increased activity on fracturing demand could be compounded by labour constraints, attrition of older equipment and supply chain limitations which could extend the lead-time for construction, delivery and deployment of new capacity.\nThe demand for supply chain inputs is expected to drive modest cost inflation, specifically wage inflation for labour in the U.S. STEP will maintain our disciplined focus on operational efficiencies to assist with driving our financial performance. In addition, we will continue to monitor conditions in real-time to assess and anticipate the market’s ability to absorb new capacity and adjust our activities accordingly.\nANnual general meeting\nSTEP will hold its annual general meeting on June 25, 2018 at 10:00am MDT in the Bow Valley Club located at 250 6 Ave SW, Calgary, Alberta.\nNON‐IFRS MEASURES\nPlease see the discussion in the Non‐IFRS Measures section of the MD&A for the reconciliation of non‐IFRS items to IFRS measures.\nFORWARD‐LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains certain forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
