He did not elaborate.\nThe two have so far jointly provided combined loans of more than $700 million for four infrastructure projects, three of them in South Asia. WARNING ON PROTECTIONISM\nReferring to U.S.-China tensions, Nakao said the ADB was concerned about protectionism and trade troubles as Asia would suffer, but there were so far no signs of that.\nThe ADB has forecast growth of 6.0 percent for developing Asia this year, fuelled by solid export demand, but it has warned that U.S. protectionist measures and subsequent retaliation could undermine trade.\n“If trade is interrupted, it will have large damage to Asian countries as well as to other countries in the world. If this continues to escalate, it will have negative impact,” Nakao said.\n“At this moment it does not have impact on sentiment of people, investors and market players,” he said\nThe May 3-6 meeting comes as the Japanese-led ADB, formed in 1966 to help pull millions of Asians out of poverty, is watching closely as China asserts itself internationally via its vaunted “belt and road” initiative, and pushes regional infrastructure plans with support of its state-owned banks and the AIIB.\nKey topics to be discussed are free trade, globalisation, ageing populations, environmental degradation, gender equality, and the trend towards automation.\nNakao said he was optimistic that there were more opportunities in Asia to create jobs rather than lose them to machines and software, and said developments in technology are helping to boost equality among populations.\nThe ADB estimates developing Asia needs to invest $1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure until 2030 to maintain its growth momentum and the regional lender’s targets on poverty and climate change.\nNakao said that along with infrastructure development and poverty reduction, there was a need to introduce social security and universal healthcare to Asian economies, and make progressive tax reforms.
