This change will just make it easier to complete the connections you want to make for your child without having to friend the other parents,” read the statement.\nMessenger Kids debuted in December 2017 and is aimed at children as young as 6 years old, as children cannot create full-fledged Facebook accounts until they are 13-years-old. The app does not create a Facebook account for children and allows parents to monitor who they are communicating with.
