This is enough for tough condemnation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n“We will act aggressively and protect the interests of Russian media to the fullest extent.” Reporting by Natalia Zinets; editing by Matthias Williams and Angus MacSwan", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:06:47.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
