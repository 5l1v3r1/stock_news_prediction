The IPO is expected to be priced on Wednesday evening and the stock begins trading on Thursday.\nThe company revised its expected IPO price range to between $12 and $14 per share, up from the prior $10 to $12 per share range. The offering size of 20.7 million shares was left unchanged. ( https://bit.ly/2KoeiWJ )\nAt $14, the company will raise nearly $290 million in net proceeds, which it said it will largely use to lower its debt. The $2 billion-valuation excludes a green shoe option.\nFollowing the IPO, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Aaron Skonnard will hold about 54.4 percent of voting power.\nThe company is backed by Insight Venture Partners, which is also an investor in ride-sharing company BlaBlaCar and crowdfunding platform Indiegogo.\nPluralSight's platform provides online learning courses which is used by businesses to train their employees in technology-based skills such as HTML and JavaScript.\nIts customers include Adobe, telecommunications giant AT&T Inc and VMware Inc.\nMorgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Barclays and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters to the offering.\nFarmington, Utah-based PluralSight has achieved 'unicorn' status - a tag given to companies that have reached $1 billion in valuation without tapping the stock markets.
