Until it’s a bigger market and a bit more transparent, they are more than happy to wait on the sidelines,” he said.\nLME CEO Matt Chamberlain said the exchange’s planned lithium contract had seen interest both from project developers looking to secure funding and from lithium buyers.\n“There is genuinely a desire across the industry, both from the consumers – the battery manufacturers and the auto manufacturers - but also from the producers who are trying to add new capacity to get finance,” Chamberlain told Reuters. “So there is demand from both sides for this type of product.”\nWhile the EV revolution may be years away from igniting nickel consumption, the price impact is already being felt, according to Goldman Sachs director Rob Hawkes, as more of the metal is being used to partially displace expensive cobalt.\nIncreasingly, battery manufacturers and automakers “are going to have to start looking to hedge and lock in prices now,” Hawkes said.\n“We see continued interest from the macro community and asset managers who buy into the EV story and therefore are friendly to nickel. I don’t think you can underestimate how powerful the EV story is.”\nReporting by Melanie Burton and Tom Daly; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:16:29.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
