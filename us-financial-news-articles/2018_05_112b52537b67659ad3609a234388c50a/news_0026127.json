It also gave a disappointing forecast for yearly revenue and profit.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said the weak forecast was benign compared with the news of the investigation.\n\"While we've seen companies put matters of outstanding, transactions, litigation or investigation off-limits for Q&A, we've never seen a company cut off any Q&A on any topic from analysts or investors,\" Weiss said.\n(Reporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru and Jim Finkle in Toronto; editing by Patrick Graham and Sai Sachin Ravikumar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:06:13.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
