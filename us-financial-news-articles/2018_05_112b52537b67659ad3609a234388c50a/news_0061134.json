Some feared a repeat of the protests and looting of December 2016 when Maduro abruptly eliminated the largest bolivar note in circulation.\nConsumer protection agency Sundde on Monday warned businesses not to halt or slow operations as the monetary overhaul went into effect.\nVenezuela’s annual inflation is now close to 14,000 percent, according to the opposition-controlled legislature, as the country’s socialist economic system spirals downward.\nCash is in short supply because new banknotes have not been printed fast enough to keep up with price increases, spurring a growing use of cellular phone apps for financial transactions.\nLate socialist leader Hugo Chavez in 2008 carried out a similar so-called monetary conversion that removed three zeroes from the currency.\nBut the has bolivar depreciated by 99 percent since Maduro took office in 2013, while unchecked expansion of the money supply has give the country’s the world’s fastest rate of inflation.\nEconomists say shedding three zeroes from the currency is a palliative measure that would need to be repeated unless Maduro makes deep reforms to the country’s dysfunctional currency controls and excessive money creation.\n“It’s hyperinflation that’s the problem, not the bills,” tweeted opposition lawmaker Carlos Valero.\nMaduro, who portrays the country as the victim of an “economic war,” has in the past accused adversaries of stealing the country’s bills and smuggling them to neighboring Colombia.
