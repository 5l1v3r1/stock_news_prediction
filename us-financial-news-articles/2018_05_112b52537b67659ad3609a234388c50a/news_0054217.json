But opponents say the new rules are overly burdensome and have warned of costly business disruption.\nBy mid-morning, European readers trying to access the websites of media outlets owned by the U.S. Tronc publishing group were greeted by a message saying they were “unavailable in most European countries.”\nThe message did not explicitly name the reason for the problem but included “GDPR” in the redirected web page address.\nTronc, headquartered in Chicago, owns some of America’s biggest newspapers, including the LA Times, Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and Baltimore Sun.\n“We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market,” said the error message displayed in response to attempts to access the LA Times website in London and Brussels.\n“We continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism.” A padlock stands on a displayed European Union flag in this illustration taken May 23, 2018.
