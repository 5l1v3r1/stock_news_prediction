(OTCQB:SPIN), today announced financial results for its Fiscal 2018 first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 26% to $634,426, as compared to $501,163 during the same period the prior year.

Throughout the quarter our affiliate programs continued to garner what we believe is increasing interest from our unique services. We continued to introduce our Quad Video Halo to our target markets and through these efforts we’ve been focusing on numerous applications to enhance our knowledge of the challenges encountered in these markets that require innovative solutions where the Quad Video Halo can play a central role.

For the same period in 2017, gross revenue was $831,320, offset by $330,157 of the variable consideration discount, resulting in net revenue of $501,163. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we worked with four spine injury diagnostic centers: Houston, Texas; Tyler, Texas; Odessa, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico. Service cost was $193,645 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $156,804 for the same period in 2017. The increase in service cost is attributable to the higher case volume in Odessa, coupled with our Las Cruces affiliate recording revenue for the first time in the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred $349,273 of operating, general and administrative expenses compared to $382,028 for the same period in 2017. Operating, general and administrative expenses were lower or the 2018 quarter compared to 2017 primarily because of a decrease in consulting fees, website planning expense and payroll expenses, website planning fees, and traveling expenses totaling approximately $48,000, coupled with increases in bad debt expense, travel expense, rent, legal expenses and other expenses of $15,000. The higher consulting costs for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were mostly incurred in connection with the marketing of the QVH. There were no research and development costs during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We also experienced an increase of $8,081 in non-cash operating charges from $46,827 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $54,908 for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had net profit of $90,305 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $49,389 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, cash provided in operations was $5,068 which primarily included increases in accounts receivable of $74,201, increase of inventory of $15,782 and increases in prepaid expenses of $27,750, related party payables of $18,222 and accounts payable of $4,190.
