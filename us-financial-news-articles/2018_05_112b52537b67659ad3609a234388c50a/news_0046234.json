He struck out Brandon Crawford looking to open the inning, prompting the ejection of the San Francisco shortstop and Giants manager Bruce Bochy for arguing a low called strike on a full count.\nJake McGee (1-2), who pitched scoreless ball in the 10th and 11th innings, got the win.\nBelt’s homer came after the Rockies scored three runs in the second inning, on a two-run double by Daniel Castro and on starting pitcher Chad Bettis’ two-out RBI single for a 3-0 lead.\nNeither starting pitcher got a decision, although both padded their offensive stats.\nBettis was lifted after six innings, having allowed three runs and five hits. He walked two and struck out five.\nBettis’ run-scoring single in the three-run second produced his first RBI of the season and the fifth of his career.\nSan Francisco’s Jeff Samardzija worked two outs into the seventh inning. He also gave up three runs on five hits. He walked three and struck out three.\nOne of the top run-producers at the plate among pitchers with 11 in the last two seasons, Samardzija set up Gorkys Hernandez’s sacrifice fly in the third with a single that advanced Austin Jackson from second to third. It was his first hit of the season.\nParra, Arenado and Castro had two hits apiece for the Rockies, who improved to 2-1 on a nine-game trip.\nBelt and Jackson had two hits each for the Giants, who have lost two straight following a three-game winning streak.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:37:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
