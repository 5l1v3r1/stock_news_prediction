The company has lost 38 percent of its value since its stock market debut last year.\n\"The important thing is building that muscle of not putting numbers before doing the right thing for people using our service,\" he said. \"It requires a bit more grit than being a private company.\"\nAs an example, Spiegel referenced the company's recent app redesign.
