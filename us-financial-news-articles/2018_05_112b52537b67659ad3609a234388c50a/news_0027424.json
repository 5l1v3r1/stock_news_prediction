All financial measures, unless otherwise noted, are presented on a GAAP basis and include stock-based compensation as well as depreciation and amortization expenses.\nRevenue increased 33% year-over-year to $79.9 million during the first quarter, including $3.1 million from Redfin Now (1) . Gross profit was $5.7 million, a decrease of 11% from $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 7%, compared to 11% in the first quarter of 2017. Real estate gross profit was $6.8 million, a decrease of 6% from $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Real estate gross margin was 9%, compared to 12% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses were $42.9 million, an increase of 24% from $34.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses were 54% of revenue, down from 58% in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss was $36.4 million, compared to net loss of $28.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Stock-based compensation was $4.2 million, up from $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization was $2.0 million, up from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss per diluted share reflects accretion expense for changes in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, which was outstanding prior to its conversion to common stock following our initial public offering (\"IPO\"). GAAP net loss per diluted share of common stock was $0.44, compared to GAAP net loss per diluted share of common stock of $3.58 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net loss per diluted share (2) , which excludes accretion expense for changes in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and assumes its conversion to common stock in connection with our IPO as of the first day of the reported period, was $0.40 in the first quarter of 2017. As a result of the conversion of our redeemable convertible preferred stock in connection with our IPO, there was no accretion expense in the first quarter of 2018.\n“In the first quarter of 2018, Redfin maintained the elevated market-share growth we saw last quarter, with revenue above our guidance range, and net income near the top of our guidance range,\" said Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman. \"What drove that growth is the power of our 1% pricing for listing a home. Being able to sell homes for more money at a lower fee is a major competitive advantage, and it’s easy for consumers to understand. In the first quarter, we advertised it more broadly than ever before. If this formula of low fees, happy customers and increased advertising keeps working, the result will be not just more Redfin listings, but a better online marketplace. Several new businesses also had strong sales, which we believe can develop into major sources of growth for us not just over the next few years, but for the next decade.”\nHighlights\nReached market share of .73% of U.S. existing home sales by value in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of .02 percentage points from the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of .15 percentage points from the first quarter of 2017. (3) Continued to drive strong traffic growth, with visitors to our website and mobile applications increasing by 28% over the first quarter of 2017. Launched advertising campaign in 12 markets, including television, digital video, radio and outdoor media. The campaign is expected to run through May 2018. Increased the percentage of home tours booked automatically with Redfin Book It Now software from 79% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 83% in the first quarter of 2018. Book It Now gets homebuyers into homes faster and makes Redfin more efficient. Added the Redfin “Hot Homes” feature to 46 Redfin markets, for a total of 61 markets nationwide. Hot Homes identifies which homes for sale are likely to sell quickly, which is useful for buyers in the fast-moving, competitive environment of most major housing markets today. Homes are deemed Hot when Redfin’s proprietary algorithm calculates that there is an 80% chance of that home having an accepted offer within two weeks of its debut. Expanded Redfin Mortgage to Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, now serving homebuyers in a total of six states, with plans to launch in additional states in the coming months. Redfin Mortgage is part of the long-term vision of integrating lending with Redfin's existing brokerage and title businesses, ultimately leading to an entirely digital closing. Introduced the Redfin 1% listing fee to home sellers across the San Francisco Bay Area, subject to a minimum of $5,500. Sellers typically pay their listing agent a commission of 2.5 to 3% of the home's sale price. With the Redfin 1% listing fee, sellers will save between $15,000 and $20,000 on a $1,000,000 home sale. The 1% listing fee does not include buyer's agent commission, which is typically 2 to 3% and paid by the seller. Issued a comprehensive report comparing Redfin real estate agent pay to the pay of real estate agents at other brokerages. The study showed that Redfin agents earned more than double that of traditional agents in 2017, in addition to healthcare benefits, paid time off and parental leave. Employing and retaining the best real estate agents and paying them well is a major part of how Redfin will deliver the best real estate service to consumers. Released gender pay data for Redfin employees across 10 job categories with at least two women and two men in each category. The data showed no major pay gap between women and men, in large part because the company tries to be rigorous about paying employees based on objective guidelines.\n(1) Redfin Now is an experimental new service where we buy homes directly from homeowners and resell them to homebuyers. Revenue earned from selling homes previously purchased by Redfin Now is recorded at closing on a gross basis, representing the sales price of the home. For Redfin Now, cost of revenue includes the cost of homes such as the purchase price and capitalized improvements. There was no revenue from Redfin Now in any period prior to the three months ended June 30, 2017.\n(2) \"Adjusted net loss per diluted share\" is a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided below in the tables included in this press release. An explanation of this measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\".\n(3) We calculate the aggregate value of U.S. home sales by multiplying the total number of U.S. home sales by the mean sale price of these sales, each as reported by the National Association of REALTORS®. We calculate our market share by aggregating the home value of real estate transactions conducted by our lead agents or our partner agents. Then, in order to account for both the sell- and buy-side components of each transaction, we divide that value by two-times the estimated aggregate value of U.S. home sales.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following reflect Redfin's expectations as of May 10, 2018, and are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nFor the second quarter of 2018 we expect:\nRevenue between $134.8 million and $139.1 million, representing year-over-year growth between 29% and 33% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Redfin Now revenue between $5.2 million and $6.2 million is included in the guidance provided. Net income between $(1.0) million and $1.5 million, compared to net income of $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2017. This guidance includes approximately $4.8 million of expected stock-based compensation and $2.0 million of expected depreciation and amortization.\nConference Call\nRedfin will webcast a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today. The webcast will be open to the public at http://investors.redfin.com . The webcast will remain available on the investor relations website for at least three months following the conference call.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain within the meaning of federal securities laws, including statements regarding our future operating results included under the header Business Outlook . We believe our expectations related to these are reasonable, but actual results may turn out to be materially different. Please see our filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the in this press release. These risks include, among other things: that we operate in a seasonal and cyclical industry and may be affected by industry downturns; that we have a history of losses; and that our business is concentrated in certain geographic markets. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks and uncertainties may emerge that could impact the in this press release. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as supplemented by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website at http://investors.redfin.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . All reflect our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update to reflect future events or circumstances.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we have used a non-GAAP financial measure, specifically adjusted net loss per diluted share, in this press release. The presentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute of, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure enables comparison of financial results between periods where net loss per diluted share may vary independent of business performance.\nThere are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool, in particular the adjustments to our GAAP financial measure reflect the exclusion of accretion expense, which is related to our redeemable convertible preferred stock that converted into common stock upon the completion of our IPO in August 2017. Included in weighted-average shares outstanding, basic and diluted, are shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock as if all such shares were converted to common stock on the first date of each period presented. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. A reconciliation of adjusted net loss per diluted share to net loss per diluted share has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\nAbout Redfin\nRedfin Corporation ( www.redfin.com ) is the technology-powered, residential real estate brokerage.
