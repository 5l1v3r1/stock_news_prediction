The EU grant came from its Western Balkans Infrastructure Fund.\nAlbania has called for bids by May 31 to rehabilitate the Tirana-Durres line and build a new one to the nearby Rinas airport. Gjiknuri said it would take 22 minutes to Durres and 12 minutes to the airport once the rail line is built.\nA candidate to join the European Union, Albania will know by the end of June whether EU member countries will approve a recommendation by the European Commission to start entry talks with Albania.
