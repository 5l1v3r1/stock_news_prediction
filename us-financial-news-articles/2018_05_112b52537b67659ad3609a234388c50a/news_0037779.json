The International Energy Agency on Wednesday warned global demand growth will almost inevitably slow given how much the oil price has risen.\nMeanwhile, the rise in the U.S. dollar since the start of the year may curb the purchasing power of major importing nations to buy crude, especially since many, such as India and Indonesia, no longer offer drivers such as generous fuel subsidies.\nOPEC also has a headache in the form of rival supply from outside its club, namely from the United States, which is on course to become the largest producer in the world by the end of this year, with output set to top 11 million bpd.\nOPEC's supply cuts have been swamped by the increase in U.S. output, led by production from shale fields and this, along with the higher price, has made the major forecasting agencies -- the IEA, OPEC itself and the U.S. Energy Information Administration -- far more cautious.\nSo while $80 might be Saudi Arabia's purported magic number, its spell might prove short-lived.\n(Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:31:37.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
