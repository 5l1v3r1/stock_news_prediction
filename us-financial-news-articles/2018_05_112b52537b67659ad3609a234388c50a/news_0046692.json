Companies breaching the new rules on how they handle people’s data could incur fines of up to 4 percent of their annual revenue.\nCarphone Warehouse, which is owned by Dixons Carphone, said it had reviewed how it stored customers’ information ahead of the new law, which comes into effect on May 25.\nThe mobile phone retailer was fined in January by Britain’s Information Commissioner’s Office for a 2015 cyber attack which exposed the personal data of over 3 million customers.\nEXTRA BARRIER Under GDPR, companies will have to report serious data breaches within 72 hours and have to be able to provide European customers with a copy of the personal data they hold.\n“Citizens will now have greater rights to know what is being held by corporations, organisations,” said Richard Benham, founder of The Cyber Trust, which aims to protect those most vulnerable from cyber fraud.\n“They will have the right not only to access that information but also have the right for that information to be deleted if appropriate.”\nBusinesses around the world have been racing to make sure they comply with the rules, which apply to all companies that do business with Europeans.\nThe industries most affected will be those that collect large amounts of customer data, including technology companies, retailers, healthcare providers, insurers and banks.\n“It’s not just a tech sector issue. Data protection is key to all organisations of every size and every sector,” said Jeremy Lilley, policy manager for data protection at trade association TechUK.\nFor the consumer, analysts say the law will have the added benefit of decreasing the number of marketing emails hitting their inbox.\nIt will be policed by a patchwork of national and regional watchdogs across the 28-nation European Union bloc.\nAlthough his experience has made him more careful, Verma has not stopped using online services and is optimistic the new EU law will help with data protection.\n“I cannot avoid my data being out there ... For me, GDPR offers that extra bit of security that gives me that comfort that there’s an extra barrier. It’s like having a house and putting an alarm on it,” he said.
