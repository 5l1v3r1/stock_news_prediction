Photo: Bloomberg News\nAn abundance of capital and a need to keep pace with an increasingly digital workplace are among the factors stoking a surge in merger and acquisition activity in the first three months of the year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.\nU.S. deal values for the first quarter of 2018 jumped nearly 13% to $531 billion up from the previous three-month period, reaching the highest amount since the final quarter of 2016, according to a report by the accounting firm released last week. The total number of deals also rose 6% to 3,670.\nAging baby boomers have created a savings glut as they prepare to retire ensuring that banks have plenty of capital, according to Curt Moldenhauer, a partner at PwC’s deals practice.\n“We’re pretty bullish not just for the first quarter but for all of 2018,” Mr. Moldenhauer said. “The level of megadeals have been staggering.”\nDuring the first three months of the year, there have been 26 deals valued over $5 billion, up from nine during the first quarter of 2017, Mr. Moldenhauer said. Among notable examples, Health insurer Cigna Corp. unveiled plans in March to buy Express Scripts Holding Co. in a deal worth $54 billion.\nThe sweeping tax overhaul is enabling the current spending spree to take shape. A soaring stock market has set valuations high, matching eager sellers with flush buyers.\n“The main characteristic is a huge amount of capital supply,” Mr. Moldenhauer said.\nPwC’s report also noted that more than 1,000 U.S. deals in the first quarter of 2018, roughly a third of the total number of deals in the period, reached across sectors. Companies are often looking to bring technological capabilities in-house when striking such deals, the report said.\nMr. Moldenhauer said there were some factors that could present headwinds to the increased M&A activity. Geopolitical turmoil, rising interest rates in the U.S. and trade tension between Washington and Beijing were among the factors.\nBut he expects a strong year, he said. “Between a lower tax rate and other provisions, many companies will explore new acquisitions,” he said.\nShare this: MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS Previous CFOs Confident About U.S. Fundamentals But Fear Protectionism Next The Morning Ledger: U.S. Companies Report Best Earnings for Years After Corporate Tax Overhaul ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T13:02:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
