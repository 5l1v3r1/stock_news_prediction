The Blind Faith platform is located in the Mississippi Canyon region of the northern Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Petronius platform is in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf.\nShell shut its Ram Powell Hub, which is also in the Viosca Knoll area, on Friday.\nShell has shut the production platform at the Appomattox Hub it is developing in Norphlet in the eastern Gulf. Appomattox has not yet begun production, but the platform recently arrived on the site.\nExxon said production in the Gulf was unaffected by the evacuations and the company transferred control of its offhsore operations in Mobile Bay, Alabama, to an onshore control room.\nThe Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude output and five percent of natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nMore than 45 percent of the U.S. refining capacity and 51 percent of natural gas processing capacity is located along the Gulf.
