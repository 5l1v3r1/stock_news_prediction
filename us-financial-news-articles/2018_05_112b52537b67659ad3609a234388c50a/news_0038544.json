The Chinese authorities have set thresholds at 0.5 percent of total weight for paper, wood and plastic and 1 percent for non-ferrous metals.\nThis upends the way the recycling industry has evolved in the rest of the world.\nAs the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) — a U.S. trade group — said in its formal response to the Chinese proposals, there are more than 150 specifications for non-ferrous scrap, with impurity thresholds ranging from zero to 4 percent.\n“There is no other country in the world that uses its own set of standards as a ‘pass/fail’ test for imports,” ISRI said in a Nov. 15 submission to the World Trade Organization.\nBut that is precisely what China is now doing, hence the month-long, container-by-container inspection at the country’s ports.\nNor is this a case of copper scrap suffering collateral damage from plastics or waste paper.\nA specific concern for GAC is scrap metal containing what it terms “powdery substances”.\nThe allowable threshold for powder contaminants has been set at a draconian 0.1 percent of total weight, even though ISRI has pointed out that certain types of copper oxidise into cupric oxide powders that are still copper and satisfy ISRI specifications.\nGraphic on China's copper scrap imports, in gross weight and with implied content: tmsnrt.rs/2IgpZlD\nGraphic on top 20 suppliers in Q1 and change vs Q1 2017:\ntmsnrt.rs/2Ihlc3v\nGraphic on top 20 suppliers in Q1 by gross weight:\ntmsnrt.rs/2IgrFvr\nDOMINANT SUPPLIER The crackdown on U.S. shipments of waste effectively targets the country that has become China’s dominant supplier of copper scrap as imports from other, lower-quality suppliers wind down.\nIn gross weight terms, China’s imports slumped by almost 40 percent to 553,000 tonnes in the first quarter.\nHowever, the implied purity of those imports — calculated by cross-referencing the customs department’s dollar value of imports against the copper price — jumped from 43 percent to almost 60 percent.\nThe implied hit on copper units, therefore, has been much smaller than implied by the headline figure; something like a 5 percent drop.\nCountries that have historically supplied low-purity scrap, such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand, have registered steep drops in exports to China in the first three months of the year. Only six of the top 20 suppliers achieved any volume growth, with only two of those having been significant suppliers of scrap to China, namely Britain and the United States.\nImports from the United States grew by 5.8 percent in the quarter to 129,300 tonnes in gross weight.\nIn tonnage terms this was only a modest 8,000 tonne increase, but the import share taken by the United States jumped to 23 percent from 15 percent in the same quarter last year.\nChina’s next largest supplier, Hong Kong, suffered a 63 percent collapse to only 58,800 tonnes. In other words, China has slammed the door shut on its most important supplier of copper in scrap form.\nMORE DISRUPTION AHEAD OK, so it’s only for a month. But there are two problems with the time line.\nFirst, can GAC meet its target of “100 percent open-box inspection and quarantine” in only a month?\nSecondly, how long until the next container-level check? Because this is the way Chinese enforcement tends to work, as evidenced by the rolling campaign of environmental inspections that have caused turmoil across industrial sectors over the past year or so.\nWhich both serve to inject further uncertainty into what happens to scrap flows this year.\nIf the elimination of Category 7 scrap is the “known known”, the combination of the new “carried waste” thresholds and the enforcement of those standards is a significant “known unknown”.\nSo too is any follow-on impact on China’s domestic market copper balance.\nScrap feeds into the supply chain in two ways, as a raw material for refining and as a direct melt input by fabricators.\nIt is the dark matter of the copper universe. Statistically obscure, its presence is largely felt by proxy, either through its displacement effect on other raw materials, such as concentrates, or for refined metal.\nThis year was already shaping up for tectonic shifts in how this dark matter flows between generators of scrap and the world’s largest buyer. But things could turn out to be more tumultuous still as China’s war on waste goes global. (Editing by David Goodman)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
