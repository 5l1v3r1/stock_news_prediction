(Nasdaq:BRQS) (the “Company”), a global leader in embedded software and products for the Internet of Things (IoT), today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenues\nThe Company reported net revenue of $58.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, including $50.4 million from the Connected Solutions Business Unit which engaged in the design and manufacturing of IoT products, and $7.9 million from the MVNO Business Unit which included mobile virtual operator and some traditional telephony services. This represented an 87% increase in total net revenue from last year. The increased sales in IoT products was primarily due to orders from a customer from the emerging markets in Asia.\nWe expect a similar strong trend in the Connected Solutions sales and anticipate moderate growth in the MVNO mobile services for the rest of the year 2018.\nGross Margins\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, gross margin for the Connected Solutions Business Unit was 12.3% compared with 12.9% from 2017.
