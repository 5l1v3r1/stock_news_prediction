Environmental Services revenue increased 8.0%, or $4.3 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nELGIN, Ill., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. (Nasdaq:HCCI), a leading provider of parts cleaning, used oil re-refining, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste services primarily focused on small and mid-sized customers, today announced results for the first quarter which ended March 24, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Review\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $83.1 million compared to $80.5 million for the same quarter of 2017, an increase of 3.3%.\nOperating margin decreased to 14.3% compared to 19.7% in the first quarter of 2017 as both of our reporting segments experienced higher costs in certain areas. Our first quarter SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 14.2% compared to 16.4% for the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to lower legal fees and lower expense for incentive compensation.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter was $(0.1) million compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $4.8 million in the year earlier quarter. Earnings for the first quarter of 2017 were favorably impacted by a gain from an arbitration award of approximately $5.5 million on a pre-tax basis. Basic loss per share was $(0.01) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to basic earnings per share of $0.21 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 was favorably impacted by $0.16 due to the aforementioned arbitration award.\nSegments\nOur Environmental Services segment includes parts cleaning, containerized waste, vacuum services, antifreeze recycling, and field services. Environmental Services revenue was $57.5 million during the quarter compared to $53.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, as the Company saw growth in all of our service lines during the quarter. Environmental Services operating margin dropped to 23.1% compared to 28.1% in 2017. The decline in operating margin was primarily due to higher disposal and transportation costs during the quarter. As expected we also experienced higher costs due to the addition of sales and service resources to fuel continuing revenue growth in our business.\nPresident and CEO Brian Recatto commented, \"While we are pleased with our continued strong revenue growth in this segment, we were impacted by a spike in disposal and transportation costs during the first quarter. During the quarter we were forced to utilize secondary disposal outlets for a material portion of our containerized waste material due to an outage at one of our main third-party disposal sites which led to higher costs. Our main third-party disposal outlet has now returned to normal operations. Transportation costs in our vacuum business which utilizes railcars to move waste to the proper disposal outlet were negatively impacted by the challenges we faced in rail logistics due to the unplanned downtime experienced at our re-refinery during the first quarter. However, we are confident the steps we've taken early in the second quarter will allow us to reduce these costs relative to our revenue and give us the opportunity to restore our operating margins back to the level we experienced during the second half of fiscal 2017.\"\nOur Oil Business segment includes used oil collection activities, sales of recycled fuel oil, and re-refining activities. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Oil Business revenues decreased 5.8% to $25.7 million compared to $27.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The revenue decrease was due to unplanned downtime at our re-refinery and significantly lower charges to customers for our used oil collection services. Oil Business segment operating margin was (5.4%) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The negative operating margin for the quarter was due to poor leveraging of our fixed costs as well as higher maintenance and transportation costs caused by the unplanned downtime at the re-refinery. Higher costs for used oil feedstock as well as site closure costs also contributed to lower operating margin during the first quarter.\nRecatto commented, \"As we alluded to earlier this year, the unplanned downtime at the re-refinery during the first quarter limited our ability to produce and sell product as well as led to higher operating costs. The extended unplanned downtime caused a back-up in our logistics network which affected all aspects of this segment. The back-up of our logistics impeded our ability to offload railcars at our re-refinery, as well as our ability to offload our service vehicles due to lack of empty vessels. Looking forward, our re-refinery has been fully operational since before the beginning of the second quarter and we are currently enjoying our highest base oil pricing since 2014.\"\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAll references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., and its subsidiaries.\nThis release contains that are based upon current management expectations.

We have presented EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors, our lenders and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management uses EBITDA as a measurement tool for evaluating our actual operating performance compared to budget and prior periods. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do. EBITDA is not a measure of performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; EBITDA does not reflect tax expense or the cash requirements necessary to pay for tax obligations; and Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using EBITDA only as a supplement. (b) Legal fees incurred to resolve routine and non-routine matters stemming from the acquisition of FCC Environmental and International Petroleum Corp. (c) Non-cash compensation expenses which are recorded in SG&A (d) Gain from partial award for claims made in our arbitration related to our acquisition of FCC Environmental and International Petroleum Corp. in 2014. (e) We have presented Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it may be used by analysts, investors, our lenders, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nSource:Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PCZ49oGZEjV5ln1kVtZVg_B9bx-oGy3UDKT2TrTzRSmSzhkWyQJejCYPH54vX2u66-IbdoQKcEM1pLTYpDBojEQL3qijRapZn4lCkPlucnPe8ZsdIzYWa8yBoYZbuhAZLUnVczAFbJniYU6YryeAUQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7b97c8ae-e626-4f38-9917-d8efae312ac5", "http://crystal-clean.com/investor-relations/", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=grx42tFbKvenyC2RBJdP_MNItb_QbATVAxuewA3ZD3a7ZRgq_URNCgDEEyE_0uMhAfOgIJkF8LC1FtzKqQKZwDwIhtOYo6wJAnFm6A1E2O4="], "published": "2018-05-03T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T02:05:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
