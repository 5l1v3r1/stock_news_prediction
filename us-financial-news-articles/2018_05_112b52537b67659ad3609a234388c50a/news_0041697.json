(Comparisons to 2016 results are not relevant, as the Company was inactive and restructuring prior to mid- 2017. Revenues under the new business model did not begin until the second half of 2017.) Net revenues consisted of royalties from The Starco Group’s sales of Breathe products.\nStarco Brands’ revenues are derived from royalties received from its production partner The Starco Group (TSG) on products whose brands are owned by Starco Brands. Starco Brands books the revenue upon receipt of the royalties related to such sales, typically within 60-90 days after the products are shipped to retailers. During the first quarter of 2018, the aggregate wholesale shipments of such products was approximately $29,000. During the first quarter of 2018, these sales were exclusively in the Breathe product line, and more than doubled sequentially each month of the quarter. Because this business model was not adopted until the third quarter of 2017, there were no such revenues booked in the first half of 2017.\nOperating expenses totaled $243,840. The net loss was $248,028, or $0.00 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $203,230. See note below on “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nMr. Sklar continued, “In the weeks since the end of the first quarter, we have made several important announcements setting the stage for growth, including our distribution relationship with United Natural Foods, Inc. (a leading distributor of natural foods and other products), our global partnership with Deutsch, one of the world’s top advertising firms (which has been instrumental in the design and development of Breathe and several of our future products), and the availability of Breathe in Walmart stores across the United States. The year is off to a good start, and we look forward to sharing these results in the coming months and quarters.”\nOutlook\nThe Company continues to expect revenues to grow significantly in 2018, driven by expanded distribution of Breathe products, new product and brand launches and the addition of product licenses to be acquired during the coming year. Operating expenses are expected to grow as the Company expands its marketing team and activities.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the preliminary results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP included in this release, the Company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information including adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP metric that excludes various items that are detailed in the financial tables and accompanying footnotes reconciling GAAP to non-GAAP results contained in this release. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because the information may allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of the Company’s results. In addition, the Company believes that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s ability to make period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s operating results. This information should be considered in addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP results. The Company has reconciled the non-GAAP financial information included in this release to the nearest GAAP measures. See the attached “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nAbout Starco Brands\nStarco Brands, born out of The Starco Group, is an innovative consumer packaged goods company focused on technological innovation that changes the current landscape.
