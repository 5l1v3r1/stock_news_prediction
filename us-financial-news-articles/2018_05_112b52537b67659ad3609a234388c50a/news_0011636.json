(NYSE:PGRE) (“Paramount” or the “Company”) filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 today and reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nReported net income attributable to common stockholders of $1.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.4 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Reported Core Funds from Operations (“Core FFO”) attributable to common stockholders of $55.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $51.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Reported a 15.2% increase in Same Store Cash Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and a 6.6% increase in Same Store NOI in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year. Leased 285,167 square feet, of which the Company’s share was 216,848 square feet that was leased at a weighted average initial rent of $86.32 per square foot. Of the square footage leased, 161,215 square feet represented second generation space, for which the Company achieved a positive mark-to-market of 17.8% on a cash basis and 12.9% on a GAAP basis. Increased leased occupancy and same store leased occupancy by 50 basis points to 94.0% at March 31, 2018 from 93.5% at December 31, 2017. Amended its revolving credit facility, on January 10, 2018, to extend the maturity date from November 2018 to January 2022, with two six-month extension options and increase the capacity to $1.0 billion from $800.0 million. The interest rate on the extended facility, at current leverage levels, was lowered by 10 basis points from LIBOR plus 125 basis points to LIBOR plus 115 basis points, and the facility fee was reduced by 5 basis points from 25 basis points to 20 basis points. Increased the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock by 5.3% on March 15, 2018 to $0.10 per common share, which was paid on April 13, 2018.\nFinancial Results\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $1.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.4 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) attributable to common stockholders was $53.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $51.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. FFO attributable to common stockholders for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 includes the impact of non-core items, which are listed in the table on page 8. The aggregate of these items, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, decreased FFO attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 by $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and increased FFO attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 by $0.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share.\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders, which excludes the impact of the non-core items listed on page 8, was $55.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $51.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nPortfolio Operations\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018\nSame Store Cash NOI increased by $11.0 million, or 15.2%, to $83.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $72.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Same Store NOI increased by $6.1 million, or 6.6%, to $98.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $92.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company leased 285,167 square feet, of which the Company’s share was 216,848 square feet that was leased at a weighted average initial rent of $86.32 per square foot. This leasing activity, partially offset by lease expirations in the quarter, increased leased occupancy and same store leased occupancy (properties owned by the company in both reporting periods) by 50 basis points to 94.0% at March 31, 2018 from 93.5% at December 31, 2017. Of the 285,167 square feet leased in the first quarter, 161,215 square feet represented second generation space (space that had been vacant for less than twelve months) for which the Company achieved positive mark-to-markets of 17.8% on a cash basis and 12.9% on a GAAP basis. The weighted average lease term for leases signed during the first quarter was 8.3 years and weighted average tenant improvements and leasing commissions on these leases were $7.88 per square foot per annum, or 9.1% of initial rent.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. You can identify these statements by our use of the words “assumes,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “guidance,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Company’s control and could materially affect actual results, performance or achievements. These factors include, without limitation, the ability to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms, dependence on tenants’ financial condition, the uncertainties of real estate development, acquisition and disposition activity, the ability to effectively integrate acquisitions, the costs and availability of financing, the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations, the effects of local, national and international economic and market conditions, the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and possible impairment charges on our operating results, regulatory changes, including changes to tax laws and regulations, and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake a duty to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFFO is a supplemental measure of our performance. We present FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”). Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and expense from real estate assets, including our share of such adjustments of unconsolidated joint ventures. FFO is commonly used in the real estate industry to assist investors and analysts in comparing results of real estate companies because it excludes the effect of real estate and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. In addition, we present Core FFO as an alternative measure of our operating performance, which adjusts FFO for certain other items that we believe enhance the comparability of our FFO across periods. Core FFO, when applicable, excludes the impact of certain items, including, transaction related costs, realized and unrealized gains or losses on real estate fund investments, unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps, severance costs and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, in order to reflect the Core FFO of our real estate portfolio and operations. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results.\nFFO and Core FFO are presented as supplemental financial measures and do not fully represent our operating performance. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO and Core FFO or use other definitions of FFO and Core FFO and, accordingly, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to other real estate companies. Neither FFO nor Core FFO is intended to be a measure of cash flow or liquidity. Please refer to our financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, for purposes of evaluating our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNOI is used to measure the operating performance of our properties. NOI consists of property-related revenue (which includes rental income, tenant reimbursement income and certain other income) less operating expenses (which includes building expenses such as cleaning, security, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property administration and real estate taxes). We also present Cash NOI which deducts from NOI, straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above and below-market leases, net, including our share of such adjustments of unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we present PGRE's share of NOI and Cash NOI which represents our share of NOI and Cash NOI of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures, based on our percentage ownership in the underlying assets. We use NOI and Cash NOI internally as performance measures and believe they provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at property level.\nSame Store NOI is used to measure the operating performance of properties that were owned by us in a similar manner during both the current period and prior reporting periods and represents Same Store NOI from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures based on our percentage ownership in the underlying assets. Same Store NOI also excludes lease termination income, bad debt expense and certain other items that may vary from period to period. We also present Same Store Cash NOI, which excludes the effect of non-cash items such as the straight-lining of rental revenue and the amortization of above and below-market leases.\nA reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in this press release and in our Supplemental Information for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which is available on our website.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), during which management will discuss the first quarter results and provide commentary on business performance.
