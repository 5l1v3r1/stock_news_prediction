Phil Mickelson also took advantage of the softer greens to shoot a seven-under 64 and move into 10th at five-under 208.\nWoods picked up six birdies to reach one-under 212 but finished the round on a sour note with a three-putt bogey on 18.\nThe former world number one had moved to four under with three consecutive birdies from the 13th.\n“I was so close to shooting about seven, eight-under today,” he told reporters. “I still didn’t have enough pace on a couple that I left on the lip.\n“I’m close, I’m hitting the ball well enough to contend, to win this golf tournament, but I just haven’t made putts.”\nUihlein had five consecutive birdies from the fifth, an eagle at 10 and added two more birdies at the 14th and 15th as he missed McIlroy’s 2015 Quail Hollow record by one shot.\n“The way the golf course was set up today it felt like you could get after it a bit,” he said. “It played a little easier than it did the first two days.”\nMcIlroy, at three-under 210, had four birdies in a row before also bogeying the last.\n“I’m just not that comfortable with anything right now,” McIlroy told Golf Channel. “I’m trying really hard to hit it in the fairway and then trying really hard to get my irons on line. It’s all just a little bit of a struggle.” Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T02:45:06.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
