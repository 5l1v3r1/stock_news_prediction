But it has not been assessed yet what kind of protection would be suitable,” said Hashmi, 54.\nRaja Mushtaq Khan, a political activist and Kotli resident, said the city has been vulnerable to river flooding for decades, but there had been no concrete protection efforts taken by the government or non-governmental organizations, in part because of a lack of credible data on the threats.\nNow, with a study in hand, “work can be outlined to save thousands of residents,” said Khan, 59.\nFOREST PROTECTION Asif Hussain Shah, head of Pakistani Kashmir’s planning and development department, said establishing dedicated centers to monitor the impacts of a changing climate and develop ways for the region to adapt is a step in the right direction.\nBut the real test is whether other departments - such as the forestry department, charged with protecting the region’s fast-disappearing trees - will be able to play their part, he said.\nProtecting trees both helps limit climate change and can cut the risk of flooding, landslides and other problems as forested land absorbs more water and holds soil in place, he said.\nFor now, with the risk (of drought and floods) increasing every day ... we have to equip and prepare ourselves,” Shah said.\nAs weather patterns change, monsoon rains are shifting slowly toward the Neelum Valley, a tourist hotspot, Shah said. That knowledge will now aid preparations to cut risks in the area, he said.\nShafique Abbasi, deputy director of Kashmir’s Environmental Protection Agency, said such data is hugely needed in a country that ranks seventh in the list of the 10 most climate change vulnerable countries in the world since 1997, according to the World Climate Risk Index 2018.\n“We don’t have data on many things and these studies will pave the ways to adopt measures to mitigate climate change impacts,” Abbasi said.\nReporting by Roshan Mughal, Editing by Alex Whiting and Laurie Goering.
