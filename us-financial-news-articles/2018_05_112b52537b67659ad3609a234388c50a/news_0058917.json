McLaughlin said he's sold dummies to rugby and soccer teams, and fielded interest from basketball teams and even one hockey team, the Colorado Avalanche.\n\"They need some tweaks to make them work effectively on the ice,\" McLaughlin said.\n\"Maybe some Air Jordans on their feet on the court rather than wheels.
