And, even more importantly, we are thrilled to apply their deep A.I. expertise to cannabis.

Based on the success we have seen in the utilization of similar technology in other industries, we are extremely excited and optimistic to become the first company to introduce this incredible technology into the cannabis market and further enhance the online experience for cannabis patients.\nOur vision for the Company in becoming a global leader in medical cannabis technology is evident from the addition of our new board members coming from Google and SpaceX, industry leaders in the areas of machine learning and A.I. that chose to join Namaste’s team.
