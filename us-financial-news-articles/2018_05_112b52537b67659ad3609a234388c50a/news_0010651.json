Analysts on average had expected revenue of $244.5 million.\nCompany executives acknowledged that the new design hurt results but said they were sticking with the plan to keep content from friends separate from other publishers.\n\"The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both,\" Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in remarks prepared for a conference call with analysts.\n\"As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption, especially given the high frequency of daily engagement of our community.\"\nThe redesign was meant to draw in a broader audience but sparked criticism from users including celebrities Kylie Jenner and Chrissy Teigen.\nThe changes also created some \"apprehension\" among advertisers, Spiegel said.\n\"We are now focused on optimizing the redesign based on our ongoing experimentation and learning,\" he said.\nUser growth at the company's disappearing-message app have repeatedly fallen short of Wall Street's expectations since its heavily hyped IPO in March last year.\nThe Venice, California-based firm posted a net loss of $385.8 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, a year earlier.
