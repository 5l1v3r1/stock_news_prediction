Counsel assisting the commission said last week that, in doing so, AMP had breached provisions of the Corporations Act that carry criminal sanctions.\n“The extent of interaction between AMP and Clayton Utz has been overstated,” AMP said in a statement.\nThe company announced the resignations of its chairwoman Catherine Brenner and legal counsel on Monday, and slashed its directors’ fees by a quarter, after the Royal Commission heard damning evidence of misconduct at AMP, including that it had misled customers and deceived the corporate regulator.\nThe scandal has already caused the early departure of CEO Craig Meller, who was due to leave by year end.\nThe inquiry disclosed that advisers at AMP misappropriated funds of thousands of clients over the last decade by charging them without providing advice, and that it had repeatedly lied to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\nIn a filing to the Australian Securities Exchange, the wealth manager reiterated its apology for “the failings in respect of advice and service delivery to our customers”.\nThe year-long Royal Commission inquiry started hearings in February and has already exposed widespread wrongdoing including fraud by financial planners, deception of regulators and charging customers fees without providing a service.\nThe inquiry will be able to make wide-ranging recommendations including legislative changes and on criminal or civil prosecutions.
