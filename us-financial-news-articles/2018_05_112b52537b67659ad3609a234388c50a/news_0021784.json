The Transaction is intended to address concerns that Renren may be deemed to be an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The Transaction will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements. Please refer to the Form 6-K filed with the SEC on April 30, 2018 for unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements, based on the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as though the Transaction occurred on September 30, 2017, total Renren Inc. shareholders' equity value following the Transaction is currently estimated to range from US$209 million to US$340 million (2) . The Company will update the pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements, which includes the pro forma shareholder's equity value, as though the Transaction occurred on December 31, 2017, at the time when it files its annual report on Form 20-F with the SEC, which is expected to be on or before May 15, 2018.\n(2) The Transaction is structured in a manner that leads to significant different results for Renren which are depended on the\npercentage of the Renren shareholders that are the Eligible Shareholders who validly accept the Offer. Accordingly, the\nCompany has presented two separate pro forma balance sheets in Form 6-K illustrating the following:\nThe aggregate dollar amount of the cash dividend to be paid by Renren in the Transaction amounting to $0 assuming all\nshareholders of Renren are eligible shareholders and validly elect to waive the cash dividend\nThe aggregate dollar amount of the cash dividend to be paid by Renren in the Transaction amounting to $131 million if no\nadditional shareholders beyond the committed shareholders elect to waive the cash Dividend in respect of any of their shares in\nRenren.\nRefer to Form 6-K filed on April 30, 2018 for additional information including assumptions used in the pro forma calculation.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will not host a conference call. Please contact our Investor Relations Department if you have any questions.\nAbout Renren Inc.\nRenren Inc.
