Why it is only three or four rounds at this stage, I don’t know.\n“Everyone is excited to have him. He will be great in the changing rooms with younger players.”\nAustralian batsman Cameron Bancroft, who is serving a nine-month ban for using a piece of sandpaper on the ball in the Cape Town test, was given special dispensation earlier this week to turn out for his club side Willetton in Western Australia.
