North Korea said on Friday it was still open to talks with the United States after President Donald Trump called off a summit with leader Kim Jong Un, saying it hoped the “Trump formula” could resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons program.\nTechnical factors were also driving the bond rally, with benchmark 10-year note yields falling back from an almost seven-year high of 3.128 percent last week.\n“The Treasury market has essentially pulled back from a solid attempt to reprice to a higher yield plateau,” Lyngen said.\nThe 10-year notes gained 13/32 in price to yield 2.93 percent, down from 2.98 percent on Thursday.\nMonth-end demand was also seen as boosting bonds.\nData on Friday showed that new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in April and shipments rebounded, suggesting business spending on equipment was picking up after slowing at the end of the first quarter.\nThe bond market closed early on Friday at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) and will close on Monday for the U.S. Memorial Day holiday.
