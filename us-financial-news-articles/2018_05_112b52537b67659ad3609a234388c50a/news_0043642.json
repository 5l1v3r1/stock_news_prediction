Gross billings (non-GAAP) were RMB929.2 million (US$148.1 million), representing a 125.5% increase year-over-year. Gross profit was RMB335.7 million (US$53.5 million), representing a 146.4% increase year-over-year. Net loss was RMB245.2 million (US$39.1 million), representing a 146.8% increase year-over-year. Net loss margin, defined as net loss as a percentage of net revenue, decreased to 60.3% from 63.8% in the first quarter of 2017. New student enrollments were 152,140, representing a 128.6% increase year-over-year.[1] As of March 31, 2018, deferred revenue balance was RMB2,619.1 million (US$417.6 million).\n[1] New student enrollments for a given period refers to the total number of orders placed by students that newly enroll in at least one course during that period (including those students that enroll and then terminate their enrollment with us).\nMr. Tongbo Liu, Chief Executive Officer of Sunlands, said, \"We are pleased to deliver a strong set of results following our initial public offering on the NYSE. Our investments in higher quality educational offerings, our IT platform and distinctive marketing initiatives to attract more students led to robust growth in new student enrollments and net revenues during the first quarter. This enabled us to gain market share and strengthen our leadership position in China's online post-secondary and professional education market.\"\nMr. Liu added, \"Looking forward, we are excited by the growth potential of the higher education market in China. According to iResearch, as of December 31, 2017, there were over 600 million people between the ages of 18 and 48 without a bachelor's degree in China. Our online tutoring services are designed to address this enormous unmet demand and provide a path for underserved adult students to significantly improve their employment and career prospects. We will continue to invest in long term initiatives to unlock the potential market and attract more students to our platform, enhance our content and teaching quality, and upgrade our IT platform. We are confident that these investments will enable us to continuously improve the student experience and sustainably grow our market share.\"\nMr. Steven Yipeng Li, Chief Financial Officer of Sunlands, said, \"During the first quarter, we delivered strong financial results with net revenue increasing 161.1% year-over-year and net cash provided by operating activities of RMB226.3 million. Bolstered by the recent capital infusion from the IPO and a significant and growing deferred revenue base, we have the resources that we need to continue to build our online education platform and attract more students. We look forward to growing our market share and realizing the growth potential of our highly scalable business model in the coming quarters.\"\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter of 2018\nNet Revenues\nIn the first quarter of 2018, our net revenues increased by 161.1% to RMB406.4 million (US$64.8 million) from RMB155.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the growth in gross billings, which was attributable to an increase in new student enrollments. The significant increase in new student enrollments in the first quarter of 2018 was driven by our continuous investments in improving the quality of our courses and educational content offerings, improving our IT platform, as well as an increase in sales, branding and marketing efforts.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues increased by 263.9% from RMB19.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB70.7 million (US$11.3 million) in the first quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase in compensation for our faculty members, which mainly included teachers and mentors, as we continued to retain our existing faculty members and attract new faculty members.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit increased by 146.4% to RMB335.7 million (US$53.5 million) from RMB136.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nIn the first quarter of 2018, operating expenses were RMB588.3 million (US$93.7 million), representing a 149.2% increase from RMB236.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 137.4% to RMB499.0 million (US$79.5 million) from RMB210.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly due to increases in (i) our sales and marketing compensation; and (ii) spending on branding and marketing activities, including investments in broadening our search engine and mobile application channels.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 267.0% to RMB77.7 million (US$12.4 million) from RMB21.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in the employee compensation, mainly as a result of hiring more staff to satisfy requirements of operating as a public company; and (ii) foreign exchange losses as a result of the decline in the USD in the first quarter in 2018.\nProduct development expenses increased by 145.2% to RMB11.6 million (US$1.8 million) from RMB4.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation for our course and educational content professionals and technology development personnel during the quarter.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB245.2 million (US$39.1 million), compared with RMB99.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nBasic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per share was RMB55.25 (US$8.81) in the first quarter of 2018.\nNet Cash Generated from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was RMB226.3 million (US$36.1 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB140.4 million for the same quarter last year.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had RMB1,841.6 million (US$293.6 million) of cash and cash equivalents and RMB444.0 million (US$70.8 million) of short-term investments, compared to RMB559.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and RMB353.1 million of short-term investments as of December 31, 2017.\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of March 31, 2018, our deferred revenue balance was RMB2,619.1 million (US$417.6 million) . Revenues related to online courses are recognized on a straight line basis over the service period. Deferred revenue consists of tuition fees received from students for which services have not yet been provided to such students pursuant to the terms of those service contracts.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures incurred primarily in connection with purchases of buildings and IT infrastructure equipment necessary to support our operations. Our capital expenditures were RMB147.7 million (US$23.5 million) and RMB2.4 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was mainly due to purchases of buildings and leasehold improvements.\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, we currently expect net revenues to be between RMB460.0 million to RMB480.0 million, which would represent an increase of 123.5% to 133.2% year-over-year.\nThe above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects our current and preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions and customer demand, which are all subject to substantial uncertainty.\nExchange Rate\nThe Company's business is primarily conducted in China and all of the revenues are denominated in Renminbi (\"RMB\"). This announcement contains currency conversions of RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to US$ are made at a rate of RMB6.2726 to US$1.00, the effective noon buying rate for March 30, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.

Our management uses gross billings as a performance measurement because we generally bill our students for the entire course tuition at the time of sale of our course packages and recognize revenue proportionally over a period. EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding depreciation, amortization, interest income, and income tax expenses. We believe that gross billings and EBITDA provide valuable insight into the sales of our course packages and the performance of our business.\nThis non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure has been provided in the tables included below. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. As gross billings and EBITDA have material limitations as an analytical metric and may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider gross billings and EBITDA as a substitute for, or superior to, net revenues prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nFor investor enquiries, please contact:\nYingying Liu\nIR Director\nTel: +86 182 5691 2232\nEmail: ir@sunlands.com\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\nBrunswick Group\nZiya Yang\nTel: +86 10 5960 8600\nEmail: Sunlands@brunswickgroup.com\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data, or otherwise noted)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of March 31,\n2017\n2018\nRMB\nRMB\nUS$\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n559,459\n1,841,615\n293,597\nShort-term investments\n353,070\n443,959\n70,778\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n48,993\n112,800\n17,982\nAmounts due from related parties\n250,096\n62,726\n10,000\nDeferred costs, current\n55,073\n84,032\n13,397\nTotal current assets\n1,266,691\n2,545,132\n405,754\nNon-current assets\nProperty and equipment, net\n525,288\n549,598\n87,619\nIntangible assets, net\n1,552\n1,367\n218\nDeferred costs, non-current\n43,187\n61,618\n9,823\nLong-term investment\n3,300\n2,464\n393\nOther non-current assets\n129,641\n134,232\n21,400\nTotal non-current assets\n702,968\n749,279\n119,453\nTOTAL ASSETS\n1,969,659\n3,294,411\n525,207\nLIABILITIES, MEZZANINE EQUITY AND SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities (including accrued expenses\nand other current liabilities of the consolidated VIE without recourse to\nSunlands Online Education Group of RMB223,298 and RMB233,738\nas of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively)\n235,900\n323,380\n51,556\nDeferred revenue, current (including deferred revenue, current of the\nconsolidated VIE without recourses to Sunlands Online Education Group of RMB1,325,954 and\nRMB1,325,954 and RMB1,518,741 as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively)\n2018, respectively)\n1,325,954\n1,518,741\n242,123\nPayables to acquire buildings (including payables to acquire buildings of the\nconsolidated VIE without recourse to Sunlands Online Education Group of\nRMB180,390 and nil as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018,respectively)\n240,390\n121,540\n19,376\nTotal current liabilities\n1,802,244\n1,963,661\n313,055\nNon-current liabilities\nDeferred revenue, non-current (including deferred revenue, non-current of the\nconsolidated VIE without recourse to Sunlands Online Education Group of\nRMB784,474 and RMB1,100,393 as of December 31, 2017 and March 31,\n2018, respectively)\n784,474\n1,100,393\n175,429\nTotal non-current liabilities\n784,474\n1,100,393\n175,429\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n2,586,718\n3,064,054\n488,484\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS-continued\n(Amounts in thousands, except for share and per share data, or otherwise noted)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of March 31,\n2017\n2018\nRMB\nRMB\nUS$\nMEZZANINE EQUITY\nSeries A convertible redeemable preferred shares\n292,000\n-\n-\nSeries B convertible redeemable preferred shares\n601,605\n-\n-\nSeries B+ convertible redeemable preferred shares\n131,104\n-\n-\nTOTAL MEZZANINE EQUITY\n1,024,709\n-\n-\nSHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nOrdinary shares (par value of US$0.00005, 1,000,000,000 shares\nauthorized;
