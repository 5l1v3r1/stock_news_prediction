They plan to meet their Russian counterpart in Saint Petersburg in a week to discuss the oil market.\nGlobal oil inventories were expected to drop further as the peak demand summer driving season nears, offsetting increases in U.S. shale output, Bernstein analysts said.\nSeveral banks have in recent days raised their oil price forecasts, citing tighter supplies and strong demand.\nFurther supporting prices, Royal Dutch Shell said it was halting crude exports from a major Nigerian pipeline.\nOn the flip side, high oil prices would hurt consumption, the International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday as it lowered its global oil demand growth forecast for 2018 to 1.4 million bpd from 1.5 million bpd.\nThe IEA said global oil demand would average 99.2 million bpd in 2018. U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said consumption would cross 100 million bpd during the peak summer period.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore and Ron Bousso in London; editing by Simon Webb and Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:52:03.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
