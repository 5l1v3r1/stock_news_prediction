A design for Kanepi municipality's flag and coat of arms featuring a cannabis leaf is seen during the municipality council's vote in Polgaste, Estonia May 15, 2018. Kanep is the Estonian word for cannabis. Picture taken May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\nThe name of the region, Kanepi, in southeastern Estonia, is derived from “kanep”, the Estonian word for marijuana and the hemp that their ancestors grew and processed into cloth, oil and ropes more than 150 years ago.\nThe need for a new flag came about after several different local government areas merged into the larger Kanepi.\nAn open online poll in January collected more than 12,000 votes for the cannabis symbol, despite the population of the rural district and village of Kanepi being less than 5,000.

Possession and use of small quantities of marijuana for personal use is a misdemeanor punishable with a fine.
