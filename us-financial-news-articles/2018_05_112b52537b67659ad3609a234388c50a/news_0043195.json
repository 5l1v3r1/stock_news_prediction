FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - International Friendly - Egypt vs Greece - Stadion Letzigrund, Zurich, Switzerland - March 27, 2018 Egypt coach Hector Cuper before the match REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nThe soccer-mad country has won the African Nations Cup seven times but has qualified for only two previous World Cups — in 1934 and 1990.\nOn both occasions Egypt bowed out without winning a game but under the guidance of Argentine Hector Cuper they have the ability to go deep in this year’s tournament.\nThe pace and finishing skills of forward Mohamed Salah are a lethal asset and a group including Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and hosts Russia gives Egypt a good chance of making the knockout stages for the first time.\nEgypt are ranked 46th in the world, above Russia and Saudi Arabia, and should finish second in Group A behind Uruguay but will probably face title contenders Spain or Portugal in the last 16.\nCuper’s team came through the third round of World Cup qualifying with four wins, a draw and one defeat, using a game plan based on a strong defensive foundation.\nThe 62-year-old, who twice took Valencia to the Champions League final, has developed a team capable of soaking up pressure and using Salah’s pace to launch devastating counter-attacks.\nThe Argentine’s tactics have divided opinion, with many fans craving more attacking adventure, but Egypt’s run to last year’s African Nations Cup final showed how effective they are at tournaments.
