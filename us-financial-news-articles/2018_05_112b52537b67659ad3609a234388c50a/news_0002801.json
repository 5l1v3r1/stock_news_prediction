RSO previously used Adjusted Funds from Operations as a non-GAAP measure of operating performance.\nCore Earnings exclude the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that RSO believes are not indicative of its current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. Core Earnings exclude income (loss) from all non-core assets, such as commercial finance, middle market lending, residential mortgage lending, certain legacy CRE loans and other non-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date. (1)\nCore Earnings, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for loan losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (2)(3) (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations. Core Earnings may also be adjusted periodically to exclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items.\nAlthough pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement RSO calculates incentive compensation using Core Earnings excluding incentive fees payable to the Manager, beginning with the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 RSO includes incentive fees payable to the Manager in Core Earnings for reporting purposes.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or as a measure of liquidity under GAAP. RSO's methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies used by other companies to calculate similar supplemental performance measures, and, accordingly, its reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to similar performance measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from GAAP net (loss) income allocable to common shares to Core Earnings allocable to common shares for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data): For the Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP $ (12,582 ) $ 2,700 Adjustment for realized gain on CRE assets — — Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP, adjusted (12,582 ) 2,700 Reconciling items from continuing operations: Non-cash equity compensation expense 967 788 Non-cash (recovery of) provision for CRE loan losses (799 ) 860 Realized loss on core activities (4) (2,167 ) — Non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings 778 414 Net income from limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date (1) — (358 ) Income tax (benefit) expense from non-core investments (2)(3) (32 ) 1,499 Net realized loss on non-core assets (2)(3) 215 — Net loss (income) from non-core assets (3) 397 (1,429 ) Reconciling items from discontinued operations and CRE assets: Net interest income on legacy CRE loans held for sale (322 ) (1,324 ) Realized gain on liquidation of CRE loans — (6,954 ) Fair value adjustments on legacy CRE loans held for sale 4,672 — Net loss (income) from other non-CRE investments held for sale 478 (25 ) (Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (247 ) 561 Core Earnings allocable to common shares (5) (8,642 ) (3,268 ) Reconciling items for nonrecurring activities: Loss on redemption of Series B Preferred Stock 7,482 — Realized loss on core activities 2,167 — Core Earnings allocable to common shares, adjusted $ 1,007 $ (3,268 ) Weighted average common shares - diluted 31,111 30,752 Core Earnings per common share - diluted (5) $ (0.28 ) $ (0.11 ) Core Earnings per common share, adjusted - diluted $ 0.03 $ (0.11 )\n(1) Initial measurement date is December 31, 2016.
