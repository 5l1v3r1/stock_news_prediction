The Company reported operating income of $985 million compared to $116 million for the first quarter of 2017, which includes a capital gain from the previously announced sale of the Company's Oil Additives and Fire Safety businesses. Excluding this gain, the Company showed improvement across all financial metrics, with gross profit, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income growing by 20%, 30% and 56%, respectively. Growth was supported by a 36% increase in the Company's Essential Minerals segment profit as well as by increased prices in ICL's Specialty Solutions segment. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $251 million compared to $218 million in the prior-year quarter.\nICL's Acting CEO, Asher Grinbaum, stated, \"I am proud to report that ICL recorded strong revenue and profit gains during the first quarter. These results were supported by the positive potash environment and the growth of our Specialty Fertilizers business line in our Essential Minerals segment, as well as by the value-oriented pricing approach of our Specialty Solutions segment. The Q1 results also reflect the strategic efforts of the Company over the past two years, during which time ICL has stabilized its financial position, divested low-synergy assets for net proceeds in excess of a billion dollars, reduced its debt, implemented efficiency measures, reduced its cost structure and CAPEX, and optimized its cash flow management.\"\n\"As I hand over the management of the Company to incoming CEO, Raviv Zoller, in the next few days, I am proud of ICL's many accomplishments, despite market and other challenges during the past two years in which I have served as Acting CEO. I am also grateful for having had the opportunity to serve the Company for 45 years in a variety of capacities and to have worked with ICL's talented and dedicated team of managers and employees in Israel and throughout the world. They are the strength of this Company, and I am confident that under Mr. Zoller's leadership, ICL will continue to grow and flourish.\"\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\n1-3/2018\n1-3/2017\n2017\n$\nmillions\n% of\nsales\n$\nmillions\n% of\nsales\n$\nmillions\n% of\nsales\nSales\n1,404\n-\n1,295\n-\n5,418\n-\nGross profit\n431\n31\n358\n28\n1,672\n31\nOperating income\n985\n70\n116\n9\n629\n12\nAdjusted operating income (1)\n151\n11\n116\n9\n652\n12\nNet income - shareholders of the Company\n928\n66\n68\n5\n364\n7\nEPS ($, fully diluted)\n0.73\n-\n0.05\n-\n0.29\n-\nAdjusted net income - shareholders of the Company (1)\n106\n8\n68\n5\n389\n7\nAdjusted EPS ($, fully diluted)\n0.08\n-\n0.05\n-\n0.30\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)\n251\n18\n218\n17\n1,059\n20\nCash flows from operating activities\n36\n-\n195\n-\n847\n-\nPurchases of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets (3)\n127\n-\n106\n-\n457\n-\n(1) See \"Adjustments to reported operating and net income\" in the Appendix.\n(2) See \"Adjusted EBITDA for the periods of activity\" in the Appendix.\n(3) See \"Condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (unaudited)\" in the Appendix\nResults analysis:\nOperating\nSales\nExpenses\nincome\n$ millions\n$ millions\n$ millions\nQ1 2017 figures\n1,295\n(1,179)\n116\nTotal adjustments Q1 2017\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted Q1 2017 figures\n1,295\n(1,179)\n116\nQuantity\n(54)\n63\n9\nup\nPrice\n76\n-\n76\nup\nExchange rate\n87\n(100)\n(13)\ndown\nRaw materials\n-\n(17)\n(17)\ndown\nEnergy\n-\n(7)\n(7)\ndown\nTransportation\n-\n(7)\n(7)\ndown\nOperating and other expenses\n-\n(6)\n(6)\ndown\nAdjusted Q1 2018 figures\n1,404\n(1,253)\n151\nTotal adjustments Q1 2018*\n-\n(834)\n(834)\nQ1 2018 figures\n1,404\n(419)\n985\n* See \"Adjustments to reported operating and net income\" above.\nRevenue: Consolidated sales improved by about 8% to $1,404 million in Q1 2018, driven primarily by higher potash prices (an increase of $28/tonne FOB compared to Q1 2017) as well as higher prices for bromine and derivatives and specialty phosphates. Higher sales quantities of potash at ICL Potash & Magnesium, of dairy proteins at ICL Food Specialties and of specialty agriculture products at ICL Specialty Fertilizers were more than offset by lower sales quantities of clear brine fluids at ICL Industrial Products and of commodity phosphate fertilizers and phosphoric acid.\nOperating income: The Company reported operating income of $985 million compared to $116 million for the first quarter of 2017. Q1 2018 reported operating income includes a capital gain of $841 million from the sale of the Company's Oil Additives and Fire Safety businesses. Adjusted operating income was positively impacted primarily from an increase in the selling prices as well as by an improved product mix, mainly due to an increased share of sales from higher margin potash sites at ICL Potash. These were partly offset by an increase in raw material prices, mainly of commodity fertilizers used as raw materials for specialty fertilizers and Sulphur used as a major raw material in the phosphate value chain. Higher marine transportation prices and an increase in potash quantities sold led to an increase in transportation costs. The upward revaluation of the euro against the dollar contributed to revenue, however, exchange rate fluctuations had a negative impact on operating income as the upward revaluation of the shekel and the euro against the dollar increased production costs. The negative impact of operating and other expenses derived mainly from insurance income in Israel recorded in Q1 2017.\nFinancing expenses, net: The net reported financing expenses in the first quarter of 2018 amounted to $15 million, compared with net financing expenses of $14 million in the corresponding quarter last year. An increase in the amount of $4 million in expenses in respect of change in the fair value of foreign-currency hedging transactions was offset by a decrease in the interest expenses in respect of provisions for employee benefits.\nTax expenses: The tax expenses in the first quarter of 2018 amounted to $45 million. Excluding a tax expense of $12 million related to the completion of the divestments of the fire safety and oil additives businesses, the adjusted effective tax rate amounted to 24%.The Company's tax rate in Q1 2018 was impacted mainly by a decrease in tax rate following the tax reform in the US at the end of 2017 and by the devaluation of the shekel against the dollar during the quarter.\nCash flow& debt level: First quarter net operating cash flow of $36 million decreased by $159 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease stemmed mostly from higher sales and production quantities, mainly in ICL Potash, resulting in an increase in trade receivables and inventory as well as lower cash received from derivatives transactions in the amount of $34 million. Operating cash flow and net cash proceeds received from the sales transaction of the fire safety and oil additives businesses in the amount of $931 million, enabled ICL to reduce net debt by $768 million (after dividend payments and investments), to $2,269 million as of March 31, 2018. As a result of the timing of the Fire Safety and Oil Additives divestment at the end of the quarter, the Company ended the quarter with a high cash balance of $798 million. The Company intends to use these proceeds to reduce debt.\nDuring the quarter Fitch Ratings affirmed the Company's international corporate credit rating at BBB- with a Stable Outlook. The rating also applies to the Company's Series D debentures.\nICL'S STRATEGY\nDuring the first quarter, ICL launched its new strategy which focuses on the Company's strengths and bases its growth on its core capabilities. The strategy has two key dimensions, or pillars. The first pillar relates to the Company's three core minerals chains, potash, phosphate and bromine, which will continue to serve as the anchor of ICL's operations. This pillar focuses on reducing ICL's cost per tonne by optimizing the Company's cost structure across its production sites and operations, including at the Dead Sea, Spain, the UK and China, in order to strengthen the Company's competitive position in potash, in the phosphate value chain and in the bromine market. This pillar of the strategy also relates to growing ICL's downstream businesses through innovation and a value oriented pricing approach, by shifting YPH JV in China to specialties and by leveraging the potential growth in demand for bromine and specialty phosphates in China.\nThe second pillar of the strategy is to grow ICL's Advanced Crop Nutrition business. The Company's current activity in this area is based around its Specialty Fertilizers platform which offers NPK fertilizers using innovative CRF (Controlled Release Fertilizers), as well as water soluble solutions. The platform extends from mining minerals to providing a diversified portfolio of end products to customers. The Company will leverage this platform to offer additional tailored solutions and to provide a broader scale of services, both in ICL's existing markets and in new ones.\nGiven the technological revolution occurring in the agriculture market, and ICL's role as a major fertilizer player with expertise in developing downstream products and a strong marketing orientation, a major focus of this second pillar of the strategy is to utilize the growing role of precision agriculture which enables farmers to increase and improve their yields at lower costs. To this end, the Company will invest in additional R&D activities, engage in bolt-on acquisitions and is evaluating a wide range of possible investments, from investments in funds and establishment of a venture capital fund to direct investment in related startups for the purpose of leveraging the Company's existing synergies to offer new products, technologies and solutions geared to the farmer, with increasing use of precision agriculture.\nREVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS\nSpecialty Solutions Segment\nThe Specialty Solutions Segment, which serves diversified industrial markets, concentrates on achieving growth through a highly-tailored customer focus, product innovation, value oriented pricing approach and commercial excellence. The segment includes three business lines: ICL Industrial Products, ICL Advanced Additives and ICL Food Specialties.\nICL's Specialty Solutions segment accounted for 45% of sales (before other activities and elimination of inter-segment sales) and 59% of segments' income in the first quarter of 2018. During the quarter, the segment completed the divestment of its oil additives (P2S5) and fire safety businesses, resulting in a capital gain of $841million for the Company. ICL Industrial Products recorded solid results as higher prices across all sub-business lines offset lower clear brine fluids sales. ICL Advanced Additives achieved strong performance supported by its value oriented pricing approach. A favorable pricing trend in food phosphates and higher dairy proteins volumes contributed to a significant increase in the profit of ICL Food Specialties.\n1-3/2018\n1-3/2017\n$ millions\n$ millions\nIndustrial Products\n317\n310\nSales to external customers\n314\n308\nSales to internal customers\n3\n2\nBusiness line profit**\n78\n77\nAdvanced Additives*\n177\n169\nSales to external customers\n162\n155\nSales to internal customers\n15\n14\nBusiness line profit**\n34\n25\nFood Specialties\n167\n138\nSales to external customers\n165\n136\nSales to internal customers\n2\n2\nBusiness line profit**\n18\n12\nSetoffs (sales)\n(2)\n(4)\nTotal segment sales\n659\n613\nSegment profit ***\n131\n115\n*The operating results include the results of ICL's Fire Safety and Oil Additives (P 2 S 5 ) businesses which were sold towards the end of Q1 2018.\n** The business line's profit is aggregated by segment into our primary segment measure of earnings, and ICL does not attribute G&A expenses, finance expenses or tax expenses by segment or to individual business lines.\n*** See additional data and reconciliation between business line profit and segment profit in the appendix below.\nBusiness highlights:\nICL Industrial Products\nICL Industrial Products delivered another quarter of solid performance. During the first quarter of 2018 Elemental bromine prices in China gradually softened, and reached a slightly lower level compared to the previous quarter due to increased production in China as the seasonal winter production shutdown ended and lower environmental-related regulation on bromine producers. The business line recorded stable to moderately growing demand for bromine-based flame retardants. Sales were higher compared to Q1 2017, mainly as a result of higher prices. Phosphorous‑based flame retardants revenues increased as higher selling prices and favorable foreign exchange rates more than offset lower volumes due to a shortage of other raw materials used in the production of ICL customers' final products. One-year agreements were secured with strategic customers of bromine and bromine derivatives with higher prices and volumes. Sales of clear brine fluids in the first quarter of 2018 decreased significantly compared to Q1 2017 as a major customer of ICL Industrial Products lost market share. ICL Industrial Products achieved higher profitability for its magnesia products as a result of higher selling prices and a focus on higher margin applications. The business line recorded higher sales of solid MgCl2 for de-icing due to weather conditions on the East Coast of the US during the first quarter of 2018. ICL Industrial Products expects Q2 2018 to continue the trend and to maintain high profitability levels.\nICL Advanced Additives\nGlobal sales of phosphate salts and acids increased by approximately 10% compared to the corresponding quarter last year. The business line's performance was favorably impacted by demand from new acid and salts customers as well as by higher volumes sold to the oral care and chemical processing industries in Europe. This compensated for lower sales to the existing customer base as a result of the roll-out of ICL's value-oriented pricing approach. Continued growth of the P 2 O 5 business in China was driven by the YPH Joint Venture's increased local market share for acids. Salts sales remained at the previous year's level. Acids and salts revenue in North America was stable at the level of the corresponding quarter last year. The South American market continued its good performance, exceeding the corresponding quarter last year by approximately 25%, as a result of an increase in acids exports from Brazil to other South American countries and higher market prices. The market demand for phosphate acid and salts in the first quarter was stable globally and is expected to remain stable in 2018. The Paints and Coatings sub-business line experienced strong performance globally during Q1 2018 and sales increased by approximately 25% compared to the corresponding quarter last year. This was driven mainly by increased volumes and improved average prices especially of stabilizers and organic products. Average prices in the business line increased for the third consecutive quarter as a result of the new value oriented pricing approach. The Oil Additives (P 2 S 5 ) and Fire Safety businesses were divested at the end of the first quarter of 2018. As a result, the Company recognized a capital gain of $841 million. The aggregate sales and operating income of these businesses in the first quarter of 2018 were slightly below the first quarter of 2017.\nICL Food Specialties\nICL Food Specialties' revenue in the first quarter was significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2017. Recovered volumes in the dairy proteins business for the Infant Food market were the main driver for this increase. The strong recovery in the dairy protein business during the quarter was mainly driven by improved demand in the Chinese market. Over the second half of 2017 the dairy protein business successfully diversified its customer base and is continuing to focus on developing organic dairy solutions for the infant food industry. ICL Food Specialties' food phosphates and multi-ingredient blends business experienced some upward pressure on costs of certain raw materials during the quarter. The business line adjusted its selling prices accordingly and put into place a new global, value-oriented pricing approach. Sales in North America were below the corresponding quarter last year due to competitive pressure in the bakery market. Although European business remained negatively impacted during the quarter by the transition to a new distributor in Russia, the business line expects a stronger ramp-up of distribution for the remaining quarters of the year.\nResults of operations for the period January – March 2018\nIndustrial\nAdvanced\nFood\nSegment\nSales analysis\nProducts\nAdditives*\nSpecialties\nSetoff\nTotal\n$ millions\nTotal sales Q1 2017\n310\n169\n138\n(4)\n613\nQuantity\n(17)\n(8)\n13\n2\n(10)\ndown\nPrice\n15\n7\n3\n-\n25\nup\nExchange rate\n9\n9\n13\n-\n31\nup\nTotal sales Q1 2018\n317\n177\n167\n(2)\n659\n* The operating results include the results of ICL's Fire Safety and Oil Additives (P 2 S 5 ) businesses which were sold towards the end of Q1 2018.\nSegment profit analysis\n$ millions\nTotal operating income Q1 2017\n115\nQuantity\n(9)\ndown\nPrice\n25\nup\nExchange rate\n2\nup\nRaw materials\n(5)\ndown\nEnergy\n(1)\ndown\nTransportation\n-\nno change\nOperating and other (expenses) income\n4\nup\nTotal operating income Q1 2018\n131\nLower quantities derived mainly from a decrease of clear brine fluids' quantities sold at ICL Industrial Products due to a major customer's loss of market share, as well as decreased quantities sold of Oil Additives (P 2 S 5 ) at ICL Advanced Additives and of food phosphates and multi-ingredient blends businesses at ICL Food Specialties, partly offset by an increase in dairy protein quantities sold. Price increases derived mainly from bromine-based industrial products and flame retardants, acids in ICL Advanced Additives and food phosphates and multi-ingredient blends in ICL Food Specialties. The upward revaluation of the euro against the dollar contributed to revenues. This was partly offset in the operating income as the upward revaluation of the euro and the shekel against the dollar increased costs in dollar terms. The negative impact of raw materials on operating income derived mainly from an increase in the production costs of cleaner green phosphoric acid (4D), used in the production of white phosphoric acid in ICL Advanced Additives, mainly due to higher Sulphur prices.\nEssential Minerals Segment\nThe Essential Minerals segment, which serves the agricultural market, includes three business lines: ICL Potash & Magnesium, ICL Phosphate Commodities and ICL Specialty Fertilizers. The segment focuses on efficiency, process innovation and operational excellence, in order to improve its competitive position, as well as on growing its advanced crop solutions business.\nICL's Essential Minerals segment accounted for 55% of sales (before other activities and elimination of inter-segment sales) and 41% of income attributed to segments in the first quarter of 2018. The segment recorded an increase of more than 70% in its potash business profit driven by an increase in potash production and sales volumes as well as potash and Polysulphate prices, and partially offset by higher transportation costs and unfavorable exchange rates. In the phosphate commodity business line, higher fertilizers prices were offset by higher sulphur costs as well as lower volumes due to a prolonged winter in Europe. ICL Specialty Fertilizers achieved record first quarter profit driven by higher volumes, prices and favorable exchange rates.\nResults of Operations\n1-3/2018\n1-3/2017\n$ millions\n$ millions\nPotash & Magnesium\n353\n283\nSales to external customers\n325\n253\nSales to internal customers\n28\n30\nBusiness line profit*\n62\n37\nPhosphate Commodities\n265\n292\nSales to external customers\n216\n247\nSales to internal customers\n49\n45\nBusiness line profit*\n6\n8\nSpecialty Fertilizers\n221\n192\nSales to external customers\n211\n186\nSales to internal customers\n10\n6\nBusiness line profit*\n25\n20\nSetoffs (sales)\n(25)\n(33)\nTotal segment sales\n814\n734\nSegment profit *\n90\n66\nFor additional details regarding potash– see 'Potash – Stand-Alone Activities'.\n* See additional data and reconciliation between business line profit and segment profit in the appendix below\nBusiness highlights:\nDespite the recovery in crop commodity prices during the first quarter, levels are still near a ten-year low. A recent report by the USDA(US Department of Agriculture) reduced the expected yield for wheat resulting in an increase in prices. The President Trump/China \"Fair Trade\" affair has caused concern among America's farmers, who fear that a threat by China to impose a 25% tariff on soybean imports will limit exports to China. Based on the WASDE report published by the USDA in April 2018, the grain stock to use ratio for 2017/2018 agricultural year is expected to decrease slightly to 24.9%, compared with 25.5% at the end of the 2016/2017 agricultural year, and compared with 25.8% in the 2015/2016 agricultural year. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN) forecast from April 2018, early indications point to smaller wheat and coarse grain crops in 2018 A major pillar of the Company's strategy is to grow its semi-specialty business, including its Polysulphate, PotashpluS, PKpluS products. During the first quarter, PotashpluS was produced for samples and trials toward a commercial launch in the second half of 2018. In Q1 2018, total sales of semi-specialty products were $28 million, included blended PK fertilizers in different composition which are also enhanced with Polysulphate. Potash prices continued to firm during Q1 2018, supported by healthy demand. According to CRU (Fertilizer Week Historical Prices, April 5, 2018), the average CFR Brazil price (all supply sources) for the first quarter of 2018 was $293 per tonne, $13 per tonne (5%)and $48 per tonne (20%) higher than in Q4 2017 and Q1 2017, respectively. There has been very little activity towards 2018 contract settlements in India and China. The government of India has announced that the subsidy allocation for potash will decrease by around 10% in 2018/2019, reflecting a $12/tonne decrease. Market observers estimate a $55-60 per tonne difference between Chinese importers and the price proposed by suppliers for the 2018 contract price. According to recent media reports, BPC (Belarusian Potash Company) expects an increase of more than $20/tonne in the 2018 contract price vs. the 2017 price. According to customs data, China imported about 2.74 million tonnes of potash during the first quarter of 2018, about a 4.4% decrease over the corresponding quarter last year. According to the FAI (Fertilizer Association of India), potash imports for the first quarter of 2018 amounted to 1.23 million tonnes, a 50% increase over the imports in the corresponding quarter last year. According to ANDA (Brazilian National Fertilizer Association), potash imports into Brazil in the first quarter of 2018 amounted to 1.7 million tonnes, a 1.3% increase over the imports in the first quarter of 2017. Following the launch of its Bethune mine in Canada, K+S is planning to shut-down its Sigmundshall mine at the end of this year, removing about 500 thousand tonnes of capacity. In Russia, following significant delays, EuroChem launched its Usolskiy potash mine in March 2018. The second mine (VolgaKaliy) is not scheduled to commission until the end of this year. The company recently announced that it expects to produce 640,000 tonnes of potash in 2018. A new potash mine was inaugurated in Turkmenistan, with a nameplate capacity of 1.4 million tonnes per year. No product from this mine has yet been seen on the international market, but some material was said to be exported to neighboring countries in the region. ICL continues to optimize its European mineral assets: ICL Iberia shifted to profit in Q1 2018. The site is meeting its production targets and implementing an efficiency plan that is resulting in a lower cost per tonne, while progressing with construction of a new access tunnel to its mine at the Suria site. ICL UK has significantly reduced its operating loss. The site is progressing with its transition to Polysulphate in the second half of 2018, as well as with its labor reduction process. Metal magnesium: Rising raw material and production costs in China have offset weaker domestic demand pushing up prices since early 2016. However, prices remain 25-30% below regulated markets (price-protected markets). The impact of the Chinese prices combined with imports from Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey at lower prices have caused a steady price decline in ICL's Magnesium key markets, which led to lower operating results. A positive impact on demand is expected following the re-start of 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes per year of US primary aluminum capacity, as announced by Alcoa, Century Aluminum and Magnitude 7. Additionally, GF Linamar, Spartan Lightweight Metals and Shiloh Industries announced capacity increases in the US, improving the prospects for alloy sales in this premium market. The President Trump/China \"Fair Trade\" affair could serve to continue this trend.\nPhosphate Commodities\nThe phosphate commodity market continued to firm moderately during Q1 however prices appear to have stabilized toward the end of the quarter. Some minor decline has been evident in the Western Hemisphere, with producers trying to place volumes in South America. In the Eastern hemisphere, stability is projected to persist with the emergence of demand in India. At the end of Q1, the fertilizing season began in Europe, while in China the season concluded and accumulation of stocks has begun toward the renewal of the season in September. Sulphur prices moderated during the first quarter of 2018 and reached $135 per tonne CFR China at the end of the quarter, compared with a peak level of over $200 per tonne during the second half of 2017. Major capacity increases are still in progress in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. The Moroccan producer, OCP, is in the process of commissioning its fourth phosphate plant with an annual capacity of one-million tonnes of finished phosphate plant in Jorf Lasfar. The Saudi Arabian producer, Ma'aden, is in the process of ramping-up its Wa'ad Al Shamal facility with a finished product capacity of 3 million tonnes per year. Export of phosphate fertilizers (DAP, MAP and TSP) from China decreased by 14% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, to 1.2 million tonnes, as producers' margins were under pressure by stricter environmental regulation and competition from Saudi Arabia. Phosphate fertilizer imports to Brazil (DAP, MAP, TSP, SSP & 11-44) during the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 18% compared to the corresponding quarter last year, to 729 thousand tonnes. In India, the high price of phosphoric acid tilted the scale in favor of importing DAP over producing it from imported acid. According to the FAI (Fertilizer Association of India), DAP imports during the first quarter of 2018 more than doubled to 418 thousand tonnes compared to the corresponding quarter last year. Domestic DAP production, using imported rock and acid, decreased by 16.7% compared to Q1 2017, to 962 thousand tonnes. Demand in the US was firm. According to TFI (The Fertilizer Institute) data, DAP imports in the first two months of 2018 increased by 4.2% compared to the corresponding period last year, to 227 thousand tonnes. MAP imports more than doubled compared to the corresponding period last year reaching 384 thousand tonnes The average price of DAP in Q1 2018 was $423 per tonne FOB Morocco, a $33 (8.5%) increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and $51 (14.0%) increase compared to Q1 2017 (according to CRU - Fertilizer Week Historical Prices, April 5, 2018). The average price of phosphate rock (68-72% BPL) in Q1 2018 was $84 per tonne FOB Morocco, a $4 per tonne increase compared to Q4 2017 but a $12 per tonne (9%) decrease compared to Q1 2017 (according to CRU - Fertilizer Week Historical Prices, April 5, 2018). No significant change in the phosphate rock market is expected. The Moroccan producer OCP has settled second-quarter phosphoric acid contracts with its Indian joint venture partners at $730 per tonne P 2 O 5 CFR, up $52 compared to the first quarter of 2018. This is following an increase of $111 per tonne in the first quarter of 2018.With this recent increase, green phosphoric acid prices have reached their highest level since December 2015. Market observers are forecasting stability in global prices as higher supply from Morocco and Saudi Arabia are projected to be offset by lower exports from China and higher imports by India. Excluding insurance compensation received in Q1 2017 in the amount of $10 million, ICL Rotem demonstrated better results compared to the corresponding quarter last year, supported by improved market conditions. During Q2 2018, ICL Rotem is expected to enter into a maintenance period, mainly to prepare for implementation of the Clean Air Law, which is expected to unfavorably affect its production level and, as a result, sales and operating income. YPH JV results improved in Q1 2018 driven by a shift to specialty and higher margin products, as well as its implementation of efficiency and cost reduction measures. The off-season period and maintenance activities are expected to negatively impact YPH JV's results in Q2 2018. In connection with the appeal filed by Adam Teva V'Din – Israeli Association for Environmental Protection (hereinafter – ATD) in the matter of the building permit for phosphor-gypsum Pond 4, in March 2018, the Appeals Committee fully rejected the claims of ATD regarding the permit, which remains in effect up to May 31, 2018. Regarding the permits for Pond 5, the Appeals Committee determined that in connection with the northern part of the Pond, the permits for preparation and use can presently be issued. As for the southern part of the pond, the Committee determined that the permit for continuation of the preparation works and the use permit will be subject to a decision of the Tamar Local Committee, which will be issued pursuant to the results of a discussion, headed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, relating to the future of the gypsum ponds and their location.\nSpecialty Fertilizers\nICL Specialty Fertilizers' improved performance derives mainly from our specialty agriculture activities in Europe, North America and Asia‑Pacific. The strengthening of the main transaction currencies against the dollar coupled with higher volumes and prices had a significant positive effect on the total sales. The business line recorded higher sales to Europe despite a delay in fertilizer application due to harsh winter conditions. ICL Specialty Fertilizers expects to recover part of the lost sales in Q2. Improved sales volumes were recorded for controlled-release and water‑soluble fertilizers, as well as for straight fertilizers (MAP & MKP), as a result of better demand mainly in Europe and the US, which recovered following unfavorable weather conditions in 2017.\nPotash &\nPhosphate\nSpecialty\nSegment\nSales analysis\nMagnesium\nCommodities\nFertilizers\nSetoff\nTotal\n$ millions\nTotal sales Q1 2017\n283\n292\n192\n(33)\n734\nQuantity\n20\n(70)\n10\n7\n(33)\ndown\nPrice\n31\n23\n2\n-\n56\nup\nExchange rate\n19\n20\n17\n1\n57\nup\nTotal sales Q1 2018\n353\n265\n221\n(25)\n814\nSegment profit analysis\n$ millions\nTotal operating income Q1 2017\n66\nQuantity\n19\nup\nPrice\n56\nup\nExchange rate\n(10)\ndown\nRaw materials\n(15)\ndown\nEnergy\n(5)\ndown\nTransportation\n(8)\ndown\nOperating and other (expenses) income\n(13)\ndown\nTotal operating income Q1 2018\n90\nLower sales quantities of phosphate fertilizers, mainly in Europe and Asia, and of phosphoric acid were partly offset by an increase in the sales quantities of potash and specialty agriculture products. Improved product mix, mainly due to increased share of sales from higher margin sites at ICL Potash, resulted in a positive contribution of sales quantities to operating profit. The increase in prices derived mainly from an increase in potash selling prices. Sales were also positively impacted by the upward revaluation of the euro against the dollar. However, the upward revaluation of the shekel and the euro against the dollar increased production costs in dollar terms and had a negative impact on operating income. Higher Sulphur prices and an increase in commodity fertilizer prices which are used as raw materials in ICL Specialty Fertilizers had a negative impact on operating income. Operating income was also negatively impacted by higher marine transportation costs as well as higher electricity, gas and water costs. The negative impact from operating and other expenses derives mainly from insurance income in Israel recorded in Q1 2017.\nPotash Stand Alone Activities:\nMillions of dollars\n1-3/2018\n1-3/2017\nSales to external customers\n305\n231\nSales to internal customers *\n34\n36\nTotal sales\n339\n267\nGross profit\n142\n84\nPotash business profit\n71\n41\nDepreciation and amortization\n31\n27\nCapital expenditures\n57\n57\nAverage potash selling price per tonne - FOB (in $)\n244\n216\n* Sales to other business lines of ICL including its magnesium business.\nPotash stand-alone activities include, among others, Polysulphate produced in a mine in the UK and salt produced in underground mines in UK and Spain.\nSales analysis\n$ millions\nTotal sales Q1 2017\n267\nQuantity\n21\nup\nPrice\n33\nup\nExchange rate\n18\nup\nTotal sales Q1 2018\n339\nPotash business profit analysis\n$ millions\nTotal operating income Q1 2017\n41\nQuantity\n21\nup\nPrice\n33\nup\nExchange rate\n(6)\ndown\nEnergy\n(2)\ndown\nTransportation\n(13)\ndown\nOperating and other (expenses) income\n(3)\ndown\nTotal operating income Q1 2018\n71\nThe high positive contribution of quantities sold to operating income, at the same level as the contribution to sales, derived from an improved mix due to increased share of sales from higher margin sites. The contribution of potash selling prices, was partly offset by higher marine transportation prices and by the upward revaluation of the shekel and the euro against the dollar, which increased production costs in dollar terms.\nPotash – Production and Sales\nThousands of tonnes\n1-3/2018\n1-3/2017\nProduction\n1,160\n1,057\nSales to external customers\n1,021\n942\nSales to internal customers\n85\n72\nTotal sales (including internal sales)\n1,106\n1,014\nClosing inventory\n454\n709\nHigher potash production derived mainly from an increase in ICL Iberia, following an implementation of an efficiency plan in the beginning of the year and as a result of higher ore grade in the mining area during the quarter. In addition, in the first quarter of 2017 there was an operational breakdown in the mine tailing channel that unfavorably impacted production at ICL UK. Higher sales quantities derived mainly from an increase in potash sales to Asia and South America.\nPhosphate Commodities– Stand-Alone Activities\nThousands of tonnes\n1-3/2018\n1-3/2017\nPhosphate rock\nProduction of rock\n1,273\n1,400\nSales *\n119\n160\nPhosphate rock used for internal purposes\n1,061\n1,096\nPhosphate fertilizers\nProduction\n519\n570\nSales *\n518\n649\n* To external customers.\nThe decrease in the production of phosphate rock was mainly due to decreased production at ICL Rotem in Israel. Lower sales quantities of rock were mainly due to the challenging business environment and unattractive rock prices. Production of phosphate fertilizers decreased due to maintenance activities at ICL Rotem and decreased production at YPH as a result of its shift to specialty products. Lower sales quantities of phosphate fertilizers stemmed mainly from a decrease in sales in China by the YPH joint venture, as a result of the shift to specialty products and a decrease in sales to Europe due to weather-related application delays.\nDIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION\nIn respect of ICL's first quarter 2018 results, the Board of Directors declared a dividend totaling $0.04 per share or about $52 million. The dividend will be paid on June 20, 2018, with a record date of June 6, 2018.\nAbout ICL\nICL is a leading specialty minerals and specialty chemicals Company that operates three minerals chains in a unique integrated business model, serving two key markets: agriculture and industrial.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to assessments and judgments regarding macro-economic conditions and ICL's markets, operations and financial results. Forward-looking assessments and judgments are based on our management's current beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various factors, including, but not limited to, market fluctuations, especially in ICL's manufacturing locations and target markets ;the difference between actual resources and our resources estimates ;changes in the demand and price environment for ICL's products as well as the cost of shipping and energy, whether caused by actions of governments, manufacturers or consumers ;changes in the capital markets, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, credit availability, interest rates;changes in the competition structure in the market;and the factors in \"Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors\" in the Company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2018. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise them or any other information contained in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n(Financial tables follow and are also available in\nExcel format on our website located at www.icl-group.com )\nAppendix:\nWe disclose in this Quarterly press release non-IFRS financial measures titled adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS attributable to the Company's shareholders, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our management uses these measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and present free cash flow to facilitate a review of our cash flows in periods. We calculate our adjusted operating income by adjusting our operating income to add certain items, as set forth in the reconciliation table \"Adjustments to reported operating and net income\" below. Certain of these items may recur. We calculate our adjusted net income attributable to the Company's shareholders by adjusting our net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to add certain items, as set forth in the reconciliation table \"Adjustments to reported operating and net income\" below, excluding the total tax impact of such adjustments and adjustments attributable to the non-controlling interests. We calculate our adjusted EBITDA by adding back to the net income attributable to the Company's shareholders the depreciation and amortization, financing expenses, net, taxes on income and the items presented in the reconciliation table \"Adjusted EBITDA for the periods of activity\" below which were adjusted for in calculating the adjusted operating income and adjusted net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. We calculate our free cash flow as our cash flows from operating activities net of our purchase of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets, and adding Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and Dividends from equity-accounted investees during such period as presented in the reconciliation table under \"Calculation of free cash flow\".\nYou should not view adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company's shareholders or adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for operating income or net income attributable to the Company's shareholders determined in accordance with IFRS, or free cash flow as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities, and you should note that our definitions of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company's shareholders, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow may differ from those used by other companies. However, we believe adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company's shareholders, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operations. In particular for free cash flow, we adjust our Capex to include any Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment because we believe such amounts offset the impact of our purchase of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets. We further adjust free cash flow to add Dividends from equity-accounted investees because receipt of such dividends affects our residual cash flow. Free cash flow does not reflect adjustment for additional items that may impact our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures, such as adjustments for charges relating to acquisitions, servicing debt obligations, changes in our deposit account balances that relate to our investing activities and other non-discretionary expenditures. Our management uses these non-IFRS measures to evaluate the Company's business strategies and management's performance. We believe that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate our performance.\nWe present a discussion in the period-to-period comparisons of the primary drivers of changes in the Company's results of operations. This discussion is based in part on management's best estimates of the impact of the main trends in its businesses. We have based the following discussion on our financial statements. You should read the following discussion together with our financial statements.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except per share data)\nFor the
