Boggs, Douglas I. Smith and Mark R. Patterson Reelected Based on Preliminary Vote Count –\n- All of the Company’s Proposals Including “Say on Pay” Have Been Approved Based on Preliminary Voting –\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HomeStreet, Inc. (Nasdaq:HMST) (the “Company” or “HomeStreet”), the parent company of HomeStreet Bank, today announced that based on the preliminary vote count at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting reviewed by its proxy solicitor, all three of the Company’s director nominees, Scott M. Boggs, Douglas I. Smith and Mark R. Patterson, have been reelected to the Company’s Board of Directors.\nHomeStreet previously indicated that, despite the substantial risk that votes on Roaring Blue Lion’s blue proxy cards would be considered invalid under Washington State banking law, the Company would count votes on blue proxy cards on a provisional basis, subject to the final determination as to the validity of the blue proxy cards. Notably, whether or not votes on blue proxy cards are counted, all of the Board’s nominees were reelected by a majority of the votes cast and all of the Company’s proposals have been approved.\nMark K. Mason, President and CEO of HomeStreet, said, “On behalf of the entire Board and management team, I would like to thank our shareholders for their support, as well as the highly valuable input they provided during this process. Our focus at HomeStreet continues to be on executing against our clear strategic plan in order to further diversify our business and deliver shareholder value.\n“In addition, we are committed to translating the feedback we have received from our shareholders into action. We will continue to evaluate our board composition and corporate governance policies to ensure that we are taking the right steps to position the Company for success. We also appreciate the willingness of our shareholders to engage with the Company in discussing our governance practices over the course of the coming year following proxy season. Most importantly, we look forward to further dialogue with our shareholders – as well as our customers, employees and partners – around how best to maximize the potential of HomeStreet moving forward.”\nThe preliminary voting results also indicate that shareholders approved all other proposals considered at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting, including the advisory vote (non-binding) to approve executive compensation, proposal on the advisory (non-binding) vote on the frequency of future advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation and the advisory non-binding ratification of the appointment of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe Company will file the voting results, as tabulated by the independent Inspector of Elections, on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days.\nAbout HomeStreet, Inc.\nHomeStreet, Inc.
