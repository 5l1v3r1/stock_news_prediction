While the tech company beat Wall Street expectations on many fronts, one disappointing number was iPhone sales. The company sold 52.2 million phonesin the March quarter — higher than the 51 million sold during the same quarter last year, but analysts were expecting 53 million.\nBut while customer upgrade rates are low, Piecyk said sales will continue to grow. He pointed out that sales of Apple’s 6 and 6 Plus were higher than other models because of pent-up demand for new products. And, as those phones age and Apple introduces new features and improvements, consumers will be more motivated to update their phones.\n“You may hold on to [your phone] longer because it’s really expensive,” Piecyk said on “Power Lunch” Wednesday. “But if you’re staring at it however many hours a day, it’s going to be important for you to get a new one at some point. That’s where the loyalty factor comes in. Those customers are not going and buying android phones. They’re buying Apples.”\nIn addition, while the iPhone X is the most expensive Apple phone to date, starting at about $1,000, Tim Cook said during the conference call that the phone was also the most popular phone sold in China during the quarter. China is one of Apple’s most competitive markets.\nIn response to the earnings report, the analyst increased his price target fpr Apple from $198 to $207 and rated the stock as a buy.
