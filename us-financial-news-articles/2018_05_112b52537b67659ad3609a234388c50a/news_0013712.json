Culture is part of our daily life, and this is a special opportunity,” said Julien Claude-Penegry, communications director of the Paris Naturists Association, in the Palais de Tokyo’s vast concrete and steel hallways.\n“Today, the mentality is changing. Naturists ... are pushing past barriers, taboos or mentalities that were obstructive.”\nAccording to the association, which has 88,000 followers in Paris alone, there are 2.6 million naturist practitioners in France.\nNext in store is a nudist clubbing night planned for later this year.\nNudist events at museums are not unheard of. A gallery in Vienna invited visitors to take their clothes off for a special viewing in 2013 of an exhibit dedicated to paintings of male nudity, while a museum in Australia has also opened its doors to naked viewers.
