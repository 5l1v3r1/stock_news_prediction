So far this year BI has bought 50 trillion rupiah ($3.54 billion) of government bonds from foreign sellers with most of the operations done in the past month, he said.\nBI raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 4.50 percent last week, the first hike since November 2014.\nWhen the rupiah extended falls the next day, outgoing governor Agus Martowardojo, said BI would be prepared to raise rates further.\nWarjiyo reiterated his predecessor’s view that the current weakness in the rupiah was due to external factors.\nHe said Southeast Asia’s largest economy had sound fundamentals, predicting economic growth at 5.2 percent this year, with an inflation rate near the midpoint of BI’s target range and a current account deficit under BI’s healthy threshold.\nThe central bank will hold a meeting with bankers and businesses, who use foreign currencies, to convey BI’s commitment to support the rupiah, Warjiyo said.\nSuch a meeting could prevent market from “overshooting the currency”, he said.\nThe new BI governor sought to draw a distinction between Indonesia and some other emerging markets, where there has been concern in the market about politicians meddling in policies.\nWhile BI was working with the government and other regulators, President Joko Widodo had pledged to uphold BI’s independence, he said.\nInvestors have sold the Turkish lira on concerns that its president would seek to influence monetary policy settings, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates by 300 basis points in an emergency move on Wednesday.\nIn a bid to calm concerns about how policy makers can support economic growth, Warjiyo said BI would balance its monetary policy tightening with looser macroprudential rules and efforts to deepen financial markets and improve payment systems.\nIndonesia’s GDP growth was 5.06 percent in the first quarter, below market expectations, and some analysts have said further tightening could choke economic activity.\n“When we raise interest rates, it doesn’t mean growth would slow immediately. The impact to growth will lag 1.5 years,” Warjiyo said. “Meanwhile, the volatility in the currency will probably only last a quarter.”\nJosua Pardede, an economist with Bank Permata in Jakarta, said he believes Warjiyo, who is an experienced central banker, “will be extra careful with the interest rate instrument” given the effects rate movements have on bank lending rates.\n“If the pressure on the rupiah continues, there is a probability of another 25 basis points hike before the end of the year,” Pardede said. $1 = 14,140 rupiah Editing by Ed Davies and Sam Holmes", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T10:25:39.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
