Berry will lead Integreon’s data, analytics and client services teams and spearhead the creation of comprehensive solutions to address clients’ litigation needs. Berry brings nearly 20 years of legal experience to his new role, working with corporate legal departments and global law firm clients.\nBerry has developed and implemented custom, integrated strategies and solutions for e-discovery and information management during complex litigation and investigations. Most recently, he was a senior vice president at UnitedLex Corporation and previously served as a managing director at Huron Consulting Group. Prior to that, Berry directed litigation consulting services at Thomson Reuters, which was later acquired by Navigant Consulting. Initially, after graduating from law school, Berry was the litigation support manager for DLA Piper.\n“Jamie’s experience in the litigation services arena is unparalleled, helping organizations to both develop their overall discovery strategy and address their day-to-day discovery and litigation challenges through the effective balance of people, processes and technology,” Rowe said. “We are excited to welcome Jamie to the Integreon family during an exciting time of progress and change within our organization, and the legal industry as a whole.”\nIn his new role, Berry plans to focus on further building brand awareness of Integreon’s litigation services practice and launching new creative services for existing and new clients. The company’s managed litigation services include: discovery consulting; digital forensics; data analytics consulting; data reduction and ECA; high-speed processing; hosted review and managed review. Additionally, Integreon’s Allegory technology provides real-time access to all litigation information in context, offering clients a greater level of transparency and efficiency for even the most complex matters.\n“As the line between in-house and law firm work continues to evolve, Integreon combines valuable expertise with tested, credible workflows to solve important business challenges,” Berry said. “With our comprehensive set of offerings, Integreon is uniquely positioned to be the process experts for organizations with discovery challenges and deliver cost-effective, creative solutions for problems.” Integreon’s integrated and flexible pricing model, Simplicity Plus, also reduces the barriers for legal departments and law firms to leverage Integreon’s people, processes and technology while using alternative commercial models.\n“We have removed complex pricing models as an inhibitor to do business. By offering alternative, yet appropriate fee arrangements, companies gain a heightened sense of cost predictability,” Berry added. “Our commercial models are fueled by good metrics, allowing Integreon to offer cost-savings and efficiency for all discovery services.”\nBerry received his B.A. from Marquette University and his J.D. from The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law, where he is currently an adjunct professor.\nAbout Integreon\nIntegreon is a trusted, global provider of award-winning legal, document, business and research support solutions to leading law firms, legal departments, financial institutions and professional services firms.
