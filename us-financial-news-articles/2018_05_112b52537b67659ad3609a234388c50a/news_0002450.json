Steve and the board felt it important that the bank’s leadership shared the time horizons of the investment case and will now work together to secure a successor who can lead the bank through that phase,” said Chairman John Callender.\nReporting by Emma Rumney, editing by Sinead Cruise\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:04:03.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
