Moon and Kim said they would work to denuclearise the Korean peninsula and seek a peace agreement to replace the 1953 armistice.\nSince that April 27 encounter, a movie set version of the compound where the leaders met has become popular with South Koreans, who line up to recreate the famous handshake and snap a photograph.\n“It is much more realistic to actually see it here,” said Kim Sang-jin, 8, who watched the meeting live on television.\n“I wondered how they felt when holding hands, and now my curiosity has been satisfied,” he told Reuters Television.\nThe faded film set on the outskirts of Seoul, the South Korean capital, has become a destination for selfie-seeking tourists who cannot step across the real, heavily-guarded border at the exact spot the Korean leaders met.

REUTERS/Kwak Sung-Kyung\nThe set was built at a studio for the South Korean murder mystery film “Joint Security Area”, named for the United Nations-administered area along the border between the two countries technically still at war.\nThe replica compound at the KOFIC Namyangju Studio is an hour’s drive from the real Joint Security Area, near the truce village of Panmunjom, where the leaders met.\nOn a recent sunny day, families, couples and even a pet dog roamed the set, smiling and laughing as they mimicked the handshake between Moon and the reclusive Kim.\nFor many visitors, including older ones who lived through the war, the summit raised hopes for peace on the divided peninsula.
