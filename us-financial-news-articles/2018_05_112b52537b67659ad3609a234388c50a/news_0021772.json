But it must present a united front and cannot let itself be divided,” Kerkhoff said.\nGermany is urging its European partners to show some flexibility and pursue a broad trade deal with the United States that benefits both sides. But that puts Berlin at odds with European peers such as France.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:43:55.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
