Last year it launched Masoko, an e-commerce platform.\nIt’s first-half revenue announced in November showed that revenue from M-Pesa rose 16 percent, while revenue from phone calls rose by far less - only 4 percent. Mobile internet service revenue rose by nearly a third.\n“Our future is to become a platform that enables business in Kenya as well as our consumers to do their work in a different way,” Bhattacharya said. “Messenger platforms are the most popular apps, the most popular approach on the internet today to bring people together.” ($1 = 100.3000 Kenyan shillings) (Reporting by Maggie Fick; Writing by Omar Mohammed, editing by David Evans)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:46:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
