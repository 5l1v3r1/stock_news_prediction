(AP) â€” The average price of regular-grade gasoline in the U.S. rose 7 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $2.90, the 10th week straight of increases.\nIndustry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that the jump marks the highest average price since November 2014.\nLundberg says the increase is largely driven by higher crude oil costs and the phasing-in of summer-grade gasoline, which is used to prevent smog.\nThe highest average price in the contiguous 48 states was $3.73 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The lowest was $2.45 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nThe average price for diesel fuel rose 5 cents, to $3.14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T09:35:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
