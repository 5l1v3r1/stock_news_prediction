The lights aren’t bright either. It’s dark,” she said, describing the area around her apartment block.\nThe cost of living in the city also chafes elderly farmers, who earn a meagre 500 to 800 yuan ($80 to $126) a year. They say the government should provide an allowance.\nSlideshow (4 Images) “Those who leave need to have money.
