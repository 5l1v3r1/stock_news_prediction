REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\nDaimler has submitted a software update for the engines for regulatory approval, the German weekly paper said on Sunday.\nThe report comes after German motor authority KBA this week ordered Daimler to recall around 6,300 Vito vans fitted with 1.6 liter diesel Euro-6 engines globally because of engine control features to reduce exhaust emissions which KBA said breached regulations.\nThe carmaker reiterated it was cooperating fully with KBA but would appeal against the Vito recall decision and fight it in court, if necessary.\nGerman Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer has summoned Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche to a meeting at the ministry scheduled for Monday to discuss the Vito recall.\nDaily Bild reported on Friday that Daimler also faces a recall order for more than 600,000 diesel-engine vehicles including C-Class and G-Class models.\nSince rival Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, German carmakers including VW, Daimler and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) have faced a backlash against diesel technology in which they have invested billions of euros.
