Majedur Rahman said.\nThe consortium will also provide technical support worth $37 million, Rahman added.\nThe agreement was signed on Monday evening after receiving approval from the country’s regulator, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), early this month.\nThe DSE submitted a revised proposal to the BSEC last month as per the instructions of the regulator, with the unanimous consent of its shareholders.\nBesides the Chinese consortium, India’s National Stock Exchange had also submitted a proposal in December to acquire the stake that DSE put up for sale. The Chinese group was later chosen as the winner.\nThe BSEC had ordered the DSE to ensure that any deal did not include terms that contradicted the country’s laws, or those that harmed the interest of other shareholders (Reporting by Serajul Quadir; Editing by Sunil Nair)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:55:04.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
