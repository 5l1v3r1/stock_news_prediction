He scattered nine hits, allowing only one run with six strikeouts and no walks.\nGordon and Alcides Escobar each had three hits for the Royals, and Jon Jay added two hits. Yairo Munoz went 4-for-4 to lead the Cardinals, and Marcell Ozuna finished 3-for-4.\nThe Cardinals grabbed a 1-0 lead by executing a double steal in the first inning, with Jose Martinez coming home from third base as Ozuna took second.\nGordon tied the score in the second inning, smashing his fourth home run of the season to center field.\nThe Royals grabbed the lead in the third inning. Whit Merrifield drew a walk and advanced to second on a single from Gordon. Escobar delivered a two-out double to left field to bring home Merrifield.\nPerez led off the sixth inning with his seventh home run to extend the Kansas City lead to 3-1.\nJay provided some insurance with a two-run single in the ninth inning off St. Louis reliever Greg Holland.\nPerez also made his mark on defense behind the plate, twice gunning down Munoz trying to steal second base.\nCardinals starter Luke Weaver (3-4) pitched well but took the loss. He surrendered three runs on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out eight and walked one.\nRoyals relievers Brad Keller and Kelvin Herrera each pitched a scoreless inning in relief as Kansas City beat the Cardinals for the first time in the past six meetings.\nRight-hander Michael Wacha is slated to start for the Cardinals in Wednesday’s series finale. Kansas City will counter with right-hander Jakob Junis.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:15:01.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
