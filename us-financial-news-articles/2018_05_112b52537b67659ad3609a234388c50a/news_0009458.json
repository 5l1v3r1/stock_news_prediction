(NYSE: FET) today announced first quarter 2018 revenue of $250 million, an increase of $3 million from the fourth quarter 2017. Net income for the quarter was $28 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to net income of $49 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2017. Excluding $36 million, or $0.32 per share of special items, the adjusted net loss was $0.07 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. This adjusted net loss includes a negative impact of $0.02 per diluted share related to certain unrecognized tax benefits.\nSpecial items in the first quarter of 2018, on a pre-tax basis, included a gain of $34 million related to the contribution of the subsea rentals business to Ashtead Technology in exchange for a 40% interest in the combined company and a $16 million tax benefit from applying updated guidance on U.S. tax reform, partially offset by $4 million of foreign exchange losses and $7 million of other charges. See Tables 1-3 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.\nSegment Results\nCompletions segment revenue was $113 million, an increase of $9 million, or 9%, sequentially, due to improved customer spending on pressure pumping equipment, coiled tubing and downhole completion products. New inbound orders in the first quarter were $111 million, an increase of $10 million, or 10%, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 99%. The Completions segment designs and manufactures products for the well construction, completion, stimulation and intervention markets primarily in North America.\nProduction & Infrastructure segment revenue was $86 million, a 6% decrease from the fourth quarter 2017, after strong deliveries of well site production equipment in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. New inbound orders in the first quarter were $97 million, a 20% increase sequentially, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 112%. Orders for valves in the first quarter set another record, as customers prepare for downstream projects later in the year. The Production & Infrastructure segment manufactures U.S. land well site production equipment, desalination refinery equipment, and a wide range of valves for energy, industrial and mining customers.\nDrilling & Subsea segment revenue was $52 million, a decrease of $2 million from the fourth quarter 2017, primarily due to the contribution of the subsea rentals business to Ashtead in early January 2018. The decline in subsea revenue was partially offset by higher sales of drilling consumable products and handling tools. New inbound orders in the first quarter were $53 million, a 7% increase from the fourth quarter 2017, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 102%, led by orders for drilling equipment in the U.S., partially offset by delays of long anticipated orders for subsea capital equipment. Drilling & Subsea operations focus primarily on manufactured equipment and consumable products for global drilling and subsea contractors.\nReview and Outlook\nPrady Iyyanki, Forum’s President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, \"Our overall performance was in line with our expectations, except for the Subsea product line. Drilling and completions activity in North America continued to improve and we began to see the early signs of a recovery in international land drilling activity. These improving market fundamentals drove growth in orders in each of our three segments.\n\"New orders received by Forum in the first quarter were $261 million, a $30 million increase, or 13% sequentially, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 104%. Despite the slow start to the quarter, revenue was up from the prior quarter to $250 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $19 million, even with a sequential decrease of approximately $4.5 million in the Subsea product line.\n\"Our financial liquidity remains strong. During the quarter, we paid down $50 million on our revolving credit facility and we ended the quarter with approximately $277 million of total liquidity.\n\"We expect robust growth for the balance of the year, led by our North America focused Completions and Production & Infrastructure segments. We are also well positioned to capture growth opportunities in our Drilling product line as the global land rig count improves. Regarding Subsea, we expect to receive some large non-oil and gas orders in the second quarter. With these orders, and our continued focus on streamlining operations, Subsea will achieve EBITDA break even or better for the balance of the year.\"\nRecent Events\nForum received orders in the first quarter of 2018 for over 280,000 horsepower of J-Mac hydraulic fracturing power ends.\nForum was awarded a multiyear frame agreement to supply its Davis-Lynch casing and cementing equipment to an international service company, providing the opportunity to obtain significant incremental revenue.\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company contributed Forum Subsea Rentals into Ashtead Technology, a competing business, in exchange for a 40% interest in the combined company. The transaction creates a market leading independent provider of subsea survey and remotely operated vehicle equipment rental services.\nConference Call Information\nForum's conference call is scheduled for Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 9:00 AM CDT.

As a result, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $10.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Based on guidance recently issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), the Company updated our provisional estimate and recorded a $16.2 million benefit in the first quarter of 2018 to reflect the revised provisional estimate. The impacts related to U.S. tax reform remain provisional in nature and are subject to further adjustment as additional guidance is provided by the U.S. IRS regarding the application of the new U.S. corporate income tax laws.\n(2) Refer to Table 1 for schedule of adjusting items.\nForum Energy Technologies, Inc.

In addition, EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community. See the attached separate schedule for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information. (4) Refer to Table 1 for schedule of adjusting items. (5) In order to better align with the predominant customer base of the segment, the Company has moved management and financial reporting of the Company's fully rotational torque machine operations, which operates under the AMC brand, from the Drilling and Subsea segment to the Completions segment. Prior period financial information has been revised to conform with current period presentation with no impact to total segment operating results.\nForum Energy Technologies, Inc.

The Company believes that this ratio is useful to investors because it provides an indication of whether the demand for our products, in the markets in which the Company operates, is strengthening or declining. A ratio of greater than one is indicative of improving market demand, while a ratio of less than one would suggest weakening demand. In addition, the Company believes the book-to-bill ratio provides more meaningful insight into future revenues for our business than other measures, such as order backlog, because the majority of the Company's products are activity based consumable items or shorter cycle capital equipment, neither of which are typically ordered by customers far in advance.

In addition, EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community. See the attached separate schedule for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.\n(2) Foreign exchange, net primarily relates to cash and receivables denominated in U.S. dollars by some of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that report in a local currency, and therefore the loss has no economic impact in dollar terms.\nForum Energy Technologies, Inc.
