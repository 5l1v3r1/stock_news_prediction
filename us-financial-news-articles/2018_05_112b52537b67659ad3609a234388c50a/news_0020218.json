(“Gibson” or the “Company”), (TSX:GEI), announced today its operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights:\nInfrastructure segment profit of $69 million, a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to additional tankage entering service at the beginning of 2018 under take-or-pay, stable fee-based contracts\nSegment profit from continuing operations of $102 million, a 21% increase relative to the first quarter of 2017, driven by a higher contribution from Infrastructure and the impact of IFRS 16\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (1) increased by 31% to $93 million relative to the $71 million earned in the first quarter of 2017, due to the same factors as segment profit as well as the impact of cost savings initiatives completed in 2017\nDistributable cash flow from combined operations (2) of $65 million, an increase of 48% over the first quarter of 2017, resulting in a payout ratio on a trailing twelve month basis of approximately 92%\nIncurred $26 million in growth capital expenditures, with nearly the entire amount attributable to the construction of new tankage and related infrastructure at the Hardisty and Edmonton Terminals\nStrategic Developments and Highlights:\nDuring the quarter, announced the corporate strategy to accelerate Gibson’s transition to an oil infrastructure focused company, targeting 10% distributable cash flow per share growth while paying a secure, growing dividend\nAs part of the strategy, the Company announced its intention to divest of its NGL Wholesale, Canadian Truck Transportation, non-core Canadian Environmental Services and non-core U.S. Injection Stations and Truck Transportation businesses\nPlaced an 800,000 barrel expansion of the Edmonton Terminal into service on January 3, 2018, and continued to advance the construction of 1.1 million barrels of new tankage at the Hardisty Terminal that is expected to be in-service in mid-2019\nOn February 21, 2018, announced the sanction of the Viking Pipeline Project, which is expected to be in-service in the first quarter of 2019 at a capital cost of approximately $50 million\nOn March 19, 2018, announced the sale of its U.S. energy services businesses, including its U.S. Environmental Services and its U.S. seismic assets, for approximately US$96 million prior to closing adjustments or approximately $125 million at current exchange rates. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company closed both transactions\n“The solid financial and operational results in the first quarter provide a strong start to 2018, helping to push down our payout ratio and leverage as we focus on realigning and growing the business,” said Steve Spaulding, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The sanction of the Viking Pipeline Project and the sale of our U.S. energy services businesses were important first steps in executing our strategy, and we are confident that the non-core divestitures will be completed on or ahead of schedule with proceeds within or above our target range. Additionally, we are optimistic we will sanction additional capital projects over the balance of the year to provide growth visibility into 2020 and beyond. With the progress we have made over the last several months, we are very well positioned to deliver on our strategy.”\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is defined in Gibson’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”).

No assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this news release should not be unduly relied upon.

The Company does not undertake any obligations to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements except as required by securities law.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Distributable cash flow (“DCF”) from combined operations are not a measure recognized under IFRS and does not have standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other entities. Management considers these to be important supplemental measures of the Company’s performance and believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in industries with similar capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Distributable cash flow are used to assess the level of cash flow generated and to evaluate the adequacy of internally generated cash flow to fund dividends. Additional information about reconciliation of historical distributable cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA to its most closely related IFRS measure, cash flow from operating activities and segment profit, respectively, can be found in our MD&A available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on our website at www.gibsonenergy.com .\nFor further information, please contact:\nMark Chyc-Cies\nVice President, Investor Relations\nPhone: (403) 776-3146\nEmail: mark.chyccies@gibsonenergy.com\nSelected Financial Information Three months ended March 31, 2018 1 2017 1 Continuing operations Revenue $ 1,736,619 $ 1,398,823 Segment profit 102,064 84,449 Net income(loss) 12,824 (3,117 ) Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share 0.09 (0.02 ) Adjusted EBITDA 3,4 93,328 70,952 Distributable cash flow 3,4 59,490 40,469 Dividends declared 47,472 47,057 Cash flow from operating activities 127,188 99,149 Growth capital expenditures $ 26,384 $ 24,990 Combined operations 2 Combined adjusted EBITDA 2, 3, 4 $ 101,480 $ 86,906 Distributable cash flow 3, 4 $ 65,293 $ 43,714\nLast twelve months - as at March 31, 2018 2017 Debt ratios 5\nTotal and senior debt leverage ratio 3.6 3.4 Interest coverage ratio 5.0 2.8 1 The current period results include the impacts from the adoption of new accounting standards as discussed on page 29 and 30.
