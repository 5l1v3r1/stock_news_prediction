In an effort to continue to scale Thrive Global’s mission of ending the epidemic of stress and burnout around the world, the company has hired top talent including Laurie Weisberg as Chief Revenue Officer, Anne Sachs as Chief Content Officer, and Amy Vezzetti as Chief People Officer.\n\"Laurie, Anne and Amy are three of the most gifted and impactful leaders in their respective fields, and of course I love the fact that we are adding more women to our leadership team,\" said Arianna Huffington, Founder and CEO of Thrive Global. \"This will allow us to double down on scaling our behavior change products to make them available to companies and consumers around the world, and growing our media platform to reach tens of millions of people with the latest data on the connection between well-being and performance and great storytelling around ancient wisdom and new role models.”\nAs Thrive Global's first Chief Revenue Officer, Laurie Weisberg will lead sales and marketing for Thrive's enterprise solutions and media platform. Laurie brings more than 20 years’ experience in sales and marketing to Thrive. Most recently, she was CRO at Curalate, and prior to that Oracle Data Cloud, where she led sales and client solutions for the brand solutions group. She was part of the executive leadership team at Datalogix that transformed the business into the world’s largest data company for marketers before its 2015 sale to Oracle at a 33x return to investors.\n“My professional journey has led me to a variety of industries, but with Thrive Global, I have a natural connection and passion for our mission of helping people around the world change the way they work and live,” said Weisberg. “Adding my sales experience to this world-class team and scaling the company to bring solutions to people around the globe—at a time when the epidemic of stress and burnout is more evident than ever—is the opportunity of a lifetime.”\nAs Chief Content Officer, Anne Sachs will continue to expand the digital presence of Thrive Global’s media platform. Prior to joining Thrive, Anne managed a dual role at Condé Nast, where she served as both Executive Digital Director at W Magazine and Editorial Director for Product Partnerships at Condé Nast working across product and content. Before that she was founder of Condé Nast’s social news desk and worked in content strategy for brands including ELLEgirl and The Gallup Poll.\n\"Issues like burnout and exhaustion can seem intimidatingly broad,” said Sachs. “But seeing these same issues in context, examined through personal, honest storytelling--and not always with a sitcom-length resolution--humanizes these challenges. We all have these conversations with ourselves every day as we try to balance feeling like we're winning both personally and professionally. I'm most excited to bring these conversations out of our own headspace and into everyday life, seeded by experts who bring experience, inspiration and actual solutions to readers.”\nAs Chief People Officer, Amy Vezzetti will focus on building corporate culture internally and supporting key external initiatives. She has spent the last 18 years in strategic human resources and talent management roles including with Pfizer in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific and most recently at Tory Burch as a founding member of the HR team, during which time the business grew 5x in revenue and the team expanded 10-fold globally.\n“I love that Thrive Global is leading the way to change the way we work and live,” said Vezzetti. “Having a meaningful, healthy life and a successful career does not need to be a trade-off. I’m proud to join the team and become part of this important movement, as well as nurture a thriving internal culture that reflects this.”\nSince its launch, Thrive Global has conducted over 200 live corporate trainings to improve well-being, productivity, engagement and retention in 26 countries, including China, India, Japan and Kenya. Thrive Global’s media platform reaches a total cross-platform audience of more than 20 million users and has built a community of over 30,000 contributors, ranging from experts in neuroscience and sports medicine to business leaders, including Jeff Bezos, Denise Morrison and Richard Branson; celebrities, including Selena Gomez, Priyanka Chopra and Ashton Kutcher; and college students sharing their personal stories of how they succeed without burning out. Thrive Global has also launched season two of its podcast in partnership with iHeartMedia, sponsored by Sleep Number and hosted by Arianna Huffington, which has featured interviews with, among others, Jennifer Aniston, Andre Iguodala, Mark Cuban, Katy Perry, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Demi Lovato, Gayle King and Bozoma Saint John, on how they deal with stress and burnout and how they thrive.\nAbout Thrive Global\nFounded and led by Arianna Huffington, Thrive Global is a behavior change media and technology company helping individuals, companies and communities improve their well-being and performance.
