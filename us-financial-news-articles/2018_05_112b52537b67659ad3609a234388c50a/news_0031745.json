The two teams start a three-game series in Atlanta on Tuesday.\nAlbies went 3-for-5 to pace a nine-hit Atlanta attack and help the Braves win for the 11th time in their last 12 road games. He led off the game with a solo homer, his 13th, and added a single and a double.\nAtlanta’s other home runs came from catcher Tyler Flowers, a two-run shot in the third, and third baseman Jose Bautista, a two-run homer in the fifth. It was the first home run for Flowers, the second for Bautista, who had another long blast that turned foul.\nJulio Teheran (4-1) tossed six innings for the win. He gave up four runs on four hits, two of them home runs, and walked three while striking out one. Teheran improved to 3-0 in his career at Wrigley Field and won his fourth consecutive decision.\nRookie left-hander A.J. Minter, typically Atlanta’s setup man, pitched the ninth to earn his second save. Minter gave up two hits and walk with one out to load the bases. He struck out pinch hitter David Bote and nicked pinch hitter Ian Happ with a pitch to bring home a run. Kris Bryant, who was hitting .472 against lefties, lined out to left field to end the game.\nThe losing pitcher was Jose Quintana (4-3), who was chased after allowing six runs in 4 2/3 innings. He gave up nine hits and three walks, and he struck out six. Quintana has allowed 13 runs in seven innings against the Braves this season. He took his first career loss against Atlanta.\nThe Cubs scored two runs in the second on a two-run homer by Albert Almora Jr., his second. That ended Teheran’s scoreless streak at 16 innings.\nBryant clubbed his eighth homer, a two-run blast, in the third inning. Bryant hit .347 (8-for-23) on the Cubs’ seven-game homestand.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
