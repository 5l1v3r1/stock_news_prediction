In every home there is an injured person, in every home there is a martyr. All the mothers are sad, there is no nice Ramadan atmosphere at all,” said Sabreen al-Turk.\nNohaa Shomar, a mother living in the Beach refugee camp, said she cannot afford meat and feeds her family of nine with only rice and grains.\nIt is usually a time of celebration, but many business owners are barely staying afloat and say that no-one is buying their goods.\n“The situation is really difficult, whether Ramadan is here or not, there are economic difficulties,” said merchant Fayez al-Bitar. “How are we supposed to afford food?”\nEditing by Stephen Farrell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:45:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
