Frenchman Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) retained his third place but now trails the race leader by one minute and four seconds.\nTeam Sky’s Froome crossed the line 40 seconds behind Yates at 23rd spot to drop out of top 10 in the overall standings.\nThe four-time Tour de France winner now trails his fellow Briton by three minutes and 20 seconds as his hopes of winning the race continue to fade.\nStage 12 begins on Thursday in Osimo and runs 214km to Imola.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:12:52.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
