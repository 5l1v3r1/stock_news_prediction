I had a good run but now it’s also time to be generous with the actresses in the films.’\n“We all have to be part of the adjustment. That’s one idea. I’m going to be hated for it. I hope I can get a job after this!”\nThe issue of equality has been a running theme throughout the film festival which is the first to take place since sexual harassment allegations against some major Hollywood players surfaced last year.\nThe Cannes Film Festival runs from May 8 to May 19. 71st Cannes Film Festival - Photocall Kering Women in Motion - Cannes, France May 13, 2018.
