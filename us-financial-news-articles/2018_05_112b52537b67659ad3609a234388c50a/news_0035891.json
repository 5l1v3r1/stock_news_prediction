With the addition of the OMV wind project at the end of 2017 and completion of our financing in January, we have approximately doubled our power generation capacity and at the same time materially reduced our indebtedness. We now have a platform to integrate cryptocurrency mining as part of our strategy in an effort to maximize the value received for the power we generate. We have also commenced the installation of the recently acquired cryptocurrency mining assets with an aggregate hashpower of 27.8 PH/s which is expected to be fully commissioned shortly.”\nFor further information please contact:\nRavi Sood\nChairman\n+1 647-987-7663\nrsood@blockchainpower.com J.

The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management's determination of the components of non-GAAP and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions, a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable. Any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable.\nSource:Blockchain Power Trust", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=10vbofcw5M6zyJ6QQjN_5gQRbG7bBWrjdGhXggDqz-kR0ULL8LG62amdV64fibK0r-P62-MW0Uwey16NAlp9VQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=10vbofcw5M6zyJ6QQjN_5sE8uBqSq-nBgoRKAK0alVTnBiCt6Y1Iwa80bYHxW2HhBK18b-QIwTyzWgnu13ztoQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3a81f184-e217-42d1-af77-02f1d63006e3"], "published": "2018-05-16T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:04:19.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
