The French bank’s shares had fallen at the open but recovered to trade up 1.3 percent after quarterly profit fell short of expectations.\nDealmaking, which has been ubiquitous in European markets this year, continued apace with Worldline agreeing to buy the payments arm of Swiss stock exchange operator SIX for $2.75 billion.\nShares in the French payments company jumped 4.8 percent, while Atos, which has a majority stake in Worldline, rose 1.3 percent.\nShares in Switzerland’s Temenos jumped 4.5 percent. The banking software firm was boosted by dealmaking in the sector and by its addition to MSCI’s Switzerland index, traders said.\nMeanwhile Iliad shares sank 16 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after a management reshuffle and weak first-quarter results.\nFrench satellite firm Eutelsat also tumbled 10.8 percent after warning it could fall short of its full-year revenue target, and Danish jewelry maker Pandora fell 8.4 percent on lower than expected profit due to a slowdown in China.
