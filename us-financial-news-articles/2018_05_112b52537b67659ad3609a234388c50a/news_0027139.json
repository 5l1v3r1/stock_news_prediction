The logo of Takata Corp is seen on its display at a showroom for vehicles in Tokyo, Japan, February 9, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai\nThe air bags have also been linked to 15 deaths, according to the statement from the Senator.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ordered the first recall in 2015, but Nelson said as of March 30 some 16.4 million unrepaired inflators remain in vehicles on the highways.\nThe defective inflators, which can explode with excessive force and unleash metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks, resulted in the auto industry’s biggest recall and pushed the Japanese company to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017.\nFlorida had the highest number of injuries related to the inflators, according to the statement from Nelson, who heads the Senate committee that oversees the automakers.
