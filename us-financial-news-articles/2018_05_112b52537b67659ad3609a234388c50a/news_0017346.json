At least 400 counties in 41 states had wind farms as of January, more than double the number that had them 10 years ago, Moody's found.\nThe developments have expanded rapidly in Kansas and Minnesota, for instance. The primary factor for placing wind farms is an abundance of wind, but government tax incentives and mandated clean energy requirements can also drive their location.\nThe tax boost is especially strong in counties that are allowed to apply their locally determined property tax rate to the valuation of wind turbines, as they do in Iowa.\nThere, the state lets wind farms be phased into a county's tax base, starting at 5 percent of a turbine's assessed valuation annually until it hits a maximum of 30 percent.\nIowa's booming wind energy sector also prompted tech companies, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, to invest a total of nearly $10 billion on data centers, Moody's said.\nCounties can also tax annual kilowatt hours of wind energy produced, as is the case in Minnesota.\nMoody's expects demand for wind energy to remain strong despite the phase-out of a federal production tax credit, talk of tariffs on imported steel and waning political support for state incentives.\n(Reporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Daniel Bases and Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:22:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
