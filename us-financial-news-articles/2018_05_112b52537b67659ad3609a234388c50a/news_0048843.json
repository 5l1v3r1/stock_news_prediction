We’re almost alone as we fight it and we’re doing so with our own resources,” said Pacheco.\n“International aid is very important, but if there isn’t aid we can’t just lay down and cry,” he added.\nThe violent MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs operate in Honduras, just as they do in neighbouring El Salvador and Guatemala, where they engage in extortion, drug trafficking, assassinations and the recruitment of children.\nIn recent years, Honduras has received annual disbursements of U.S. aid of between $30 million (22.39 million pounds)and $60 million.\nAt the start of 2017, the United States provided the Central American nation $125 million, part of $750 million package U.S. officials have pledged to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\nHonduras is one of the most violent countries in the western hemisphere and has recently been convulsed by protests following a contested presidential election.\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration announced it will end temporary protections for immigrants in the United States from Honduras by early 2020, leaving potentially 57,000 people vulnerable to deportation.
