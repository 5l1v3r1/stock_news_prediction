(Nasdaq:VTVT) today reported financial and operational results for the first quarter that ended March 31, 2018.\n“We continue to make progress on all of our major programs,” said Steve Holcombe, chief executive officer, vTv Therapeutics. “While our initial readout of the results of our STEADFAST Part A Study was not what we had hoped for, we are pleased with the results of our subgroup analysis and are continuing our work in preparation for the Part B readout with a new prospectively-defined target population. We also are continuing to move our diabetes compounds into Phase 2 studies. Our GKA activator is now enrolling patients in a Phase 2 trial for type 1 diabetes and we expect interim results by year-end. We also continue to work with Huadong Medicine in China on the commencement of a Phase 2b study for our GLP-1r compound to test lower dosing levels. We remain enthusiastic for the success of these programs.”\nPre-specifying New Subgroup with the FDA for Part B Readout Expected in June\nLast week, the company announced that, based on post hoc analyses of the data from Part A of the company’s Phase 3 STEADFAST study of the investigational medication azeliragon in people with mild Alzheimer’s disease, despite not meeting co-primary endpoints, it had identified a subpopulation that showed statistically significant benefit (unadjusted for multiple post hoc comparisons) from azeliragon relative to placebo on ADAS-cog. The identified subpopulation consisted of participants with peak azeliragon blood plasma concentration of less than 7.5 ng/mL.\nBased on the subpopulation data analyses from the Part A Study and the prior azeliragon trials, the company will submit a revised Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to the Food and Drug Administration for the Part B Study that pre-specifies a target population for the primary study analysis and expects to report Part B topline efficacy results based on 12 month data in June 2018.\nThe patients in the identified subgroup (n=~48) had a -1.9 point improvement in ADAS-cog relative to the placebo group (n=200) which was statistically significant (unadjusted for multiple post hoc comparisons) (p = 0.02), and a 0.5 point improvement on CDR-sb relative to placebo (p = .06) despite the smaller sample size.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash Position : Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018, were $6.5 million compared to $11.8 million as of December 31, 2017. R&D Expenses : Research and development expenses were $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease in research and development expenses were primarily driven by decreased costs related to certain azeliragon preclinical studies which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, research and development expenses related to compound manufacturing costs for azeliragon as well as the STEADFAST and OLE studies were lower during the first quarter of 2018. G&A Expenses : General and administrative expenses were $2.3 million and $2.9 million, for the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative cost was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs in the first quarter of 2018 as well as lower expenses related to professional services. The cost of professional services were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the license transactions that were entered into in December 2017. Net Loss Before Non-Controlling Interest : Net loss before non-controlling interest was $10.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net loss before non-controlling interest of $14.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net Loss per Share : GAAP net loss per share was $0.30 and $0.44 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, based on weighted-average shares of 9.7 million in each period. Non-GAAP net loss per fully exchanged share was $0.30 and $0.44 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, based on non-GAAP fully exchanged weighted-average shares of 32.8 million in each period.\nvTv Therapeutics Inc.

The 18-month study targeted enrollment of 800 patients (400 in each trial). The first trial enrolled patients in the United States and Canada who had a clinical diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease and an MRI consistent with this diagnosis. Enrollment of the second trial included study sites in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Clinical trials involving azeliragon, including the Part B Study and the open-label extension study have been terminated based on the topline results from the Part A Study showing the trial failed to meet either of the co-primary endpoints. Topline efficacy results from the Part B Study are expected to be announced in June of 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains , which involve risks and uncertainties.

Non-GAAP earnings per fully exchanged share is defined as net loss attributable to vTv Therapeutics Inc. including the loss attributable to the non-controlling interest and assuming the exchange of all the Class B common stock of vTv Therapeutics Inc. and an equal number of non-voting common units of vTv Therapeutics LLC (“vTv Units”) for shares of Class A common stock of vTv Therapeutics Inc. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors as it eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest resulting from the exchanges of Class B common stock and vTv Units into Class A common stock. This measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following is a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings per fully exchanged share, basic and diluted to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss per share of vTv Therapeutics Class A common stock, basic and diluted and the computation of the components of this non-GAAP measure:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Numerator: Net loss attributable to vTv Therapeutics Inc. $ (2,952 ) $ (4,311 ) Reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interest from the assumed exchange of Class B shares (1)\n(7,008 ) (10,281 ) Net loss before noncontrolling interest $ (9,960 ) $ (14,592 ) Denominator: Weighted-average number of vTv Therapeutics Inc.
