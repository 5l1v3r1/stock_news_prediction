(NASDAQ:SGC), manufacturer of uniforms, career apparel and accessories, today announced that for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, net sales increased 19.8 percent to $73.1 million compared with 2017 first quarter net sales of $61.0 million. Net income for the 2018 first quarter was $2.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared with $3.8 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, reported for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2017 included a pre-tax gain of $1.0 million related to the sale of the Company’s former call center building in San Salvador. This gain resulted in an increase in earnings per share (diluted) in the first quarter of 2017 of approximately $0.05.\nMichael Benstock, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our results for the first quarter were mixed across our various segments. Uniform segment net sales were down slightly at $48.1 million versus $48.3 million. While organic growth in our uniform segment lagged in the first quarter, our results demonstrate our diversified approach and our ability to maintain discipline while navigating a competitive market environment.\n“Promotional Products net sales were up 109 percent with most of this increase coming from our two acquisitions completed in the latter part of 2017. We’re making solid progress on integration efforts, leveraging our shared services model as well as capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities across our business. The Promotional Products segment reported a pre-tax loss of approximately $0.6 million for the quarter in comparison to pre-tax income of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. This loss is attributed to the December acquisition of Tangerine and the nature of their business. Tangerine generally reports lower sales in the first and fourth quarter each year with a more significant portion of their annual sales volume coming in the second and third quarters. We are still in the early stages of integrating this recent acquisition, and we still expect the results from this acquisition to be accretive for the full year in 2018.\n“The Office Gurus, our Remote Staffing segment, had a tremendous quarter with net sales to outside customers increasing by $2.6 million or 68.8 percent as they continue to land new customers and to grow with existing customers.”\nCONFERENCE CALL\nSuperior Uniform Group will hold a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s results.
