The win went to Carl Edwards Jr. (2-0), who surrendered a long solo home run to Atlanta rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. that gave the Braves a 2-1 lead in the eighth. It was the fourth homer for Acuna.\nNeither starter figured in the decision.\nAtlanta’s Mike Foltynewicz worked five innings and allowed one run (unearned) on three hits and five walks. The right-hander struck out 10 batters and lowered his ERA to 2.87.\nAtlanta’s bullpen worked the next three innings scoreless — 2 1/3 from Luiz Gohara and two-thirds from Dan Winkler, who fanned both batters he faced.\nChicago’s Yu Darvish worked only four innings, but gave up only one run on three hits and two walks. Darvish, who remains winless, struck out five in his return from a stint on the disabled list with flu-like symptoms.\nChicago got two scoreless innings of relief from Mike Montgomery and one scoreless inning from Pedro Strop.\nThe Cubs scratched out a run in the fourth inning. Willson Contreras led off with a double and went to third on a grounder. He scored when Addison Russell struck out swinging, but the ball eluded catcher Kurt Suzuki and went for a wild pitch.\nAtlanta got the run back in the bottom of the fourth when Ender Inciarte hit his fourth homer of the season, a solo shot to right field.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:47:20.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
