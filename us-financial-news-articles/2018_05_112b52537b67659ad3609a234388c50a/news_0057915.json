In return, Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities, increasing the time it would need to produce an atom bomb if it chose to do so.\nSince U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States this month, calling the agreement deeply flawed, European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal.\nChina has also strongly supported the deal and is one of its signatories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T06:04:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
