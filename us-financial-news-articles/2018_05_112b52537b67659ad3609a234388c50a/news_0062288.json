REUTERS/Kham\nSaudi Arabia and Russia have discussed raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran.\nBrent crude LCOc1 was down 1 cent at $75.38 a barrel by 0015 GMT, after settling up 9 cents on Tuesday.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $66.86 a barrel, having earlier settled down $1.15.\nCredit Suisse analysts on Tuesday said even if Russia and OPEC producers raise output, they would likely only add an additional 500,000 bpd, which would leave inventories in the most developed countries short of the five-year average by the end of 2018.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in Vienna on June 22.\nFalling stocks and a stronger U.S. dollar index also weighed on oil prices. U.S. stock markets sank more than 1 percent, while the dollar wobbled at a 10-month high against the euro. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.\nU.S. oil got some support as U.S. crude inventories likely fell by 1.8 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. [EIA/S]\nIndustry group American Petroleum Institute (API) releases its weekly oil data at 2030 GMT, followed by the report by U.S. Energy Departmentâ€™s Energy Information Administration on Thursday, both delayed a day because of the federal Memorial Day holiday on Monday.
