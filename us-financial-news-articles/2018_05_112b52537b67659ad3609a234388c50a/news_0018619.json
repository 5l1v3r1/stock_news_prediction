The state's building sector is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions when fossil fuels power plants are factored in.\n\"This is an undeniably historic decision for the state and the U.S.,\" said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade association with about 1,000 member companies. \"California has long been our nation's biggest solar champion, and its mass adoption of solar has generated huge economic and environmental benefits, including bringing tens of billions of dollars of investment into the state.\"\nNews of the nation's most populous state mandating solar on new homes sent solar stocks higher Wednesday. SunPower added 6 percent, Sunrun jumped 4 percent, First Solar added 3 percent and Tesla picked up nearly 2 percent.\nThe commission's action on new 2019 building energy efficiency standards also apply to everything from current ventilation systems to indoor air quality. California updates its building energy efficiency standards every three years, and the state's ultimate goal is net-zero energy homes that reduces the carbon footprint of buildings and makes them effectively energy self-sufficient.\nCalifornia — now the world's fifth-largest economy — already has a reputation for pushing the boundaries when it comes to going green. The state's renewable portfolio standard requires power companies to have 50 percent of total energy sources from renewable energy such as solar, wind, geothermal and hydroelectricity by 2030.\n\"Adoption of these standards represents a quantum leap in statewide building standards,\" Bob Raymer, the technical director for the California Building Industry Association said in remarks to the energy commission prior the vote in Sacramento. \"No other state in the nation will have anything close to this — and you can bet every one of the 49 other states will be watching closely to see what happens.\"\nRaymer also applauded state regulators for working with builders \"to significantly reduce overall compliance costs and to provide increased design flexibility.\" He said the cooperation \"was the key to gaining industry support from these first-of-a-kind regulations.\"\nThe state's solar mandate for homes includes compliance credits for the installation of battery storage technology. That means homeowners with the rooftop solar systems will be able to capture cheap electricity during the middle of the day and to keep that power onsite for evening hours when rates tend to go up.\nThe commission estimates the solar mandate will add an average of about $9,500 to the upfront cost of single-family houses but result in about $19,000 in energy savings over a 30-year period.\n\"The lifetime savings are significant because in California we have high energy costs,\" said Anne Hoskins, chief policy officer for Sunrun, a large residential solar and storage provide based in San Francisco.\nThe approved standards still allow new home construction to continue with some natural gas but it looks to reduce gas need over time and facilitate a shift to high-efficiency electric appliances, such as heat pump water heaters. All-electric homes using solar are seen as having lower greenhouse gas emissions and less energy consumption than those that use natural gas.\nUnder the change, new homes are expected to cut energy use by more than 50 percent by having solar photovoltaic systems on rooftops. For residential homeowners, the commission estimates that the standards will add about $40 to an average monthly payment over a 30-year period but essentially save consumers $80 on monthly heating, cooling and lighting bills.\nThere are still significant upfront costs of requiring the solar panels on rooftops of new homes. The mandate comes at a time when California also is dealing with a housing shortage and the challenge of affordable homes statewide.\nExperts suggest the cost of adding solar on new homes in areas such as the San Francisco Bay region where real estate prices are already high may not affect homebuyers as much. But it could prove to be more challenging for new homeowners in communities with lower housing costs such as Fresno in the Central Valley.\nRegardless, the state estimates the proposed solar standards applying to most homes and many commercial structures could save California residents and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars in energy costs over the next decade.", "external_links": ["http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2019standards/rulemaking/documents/", "https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/research/research-green-buildings"], "published": "2018-05-09T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T22:27:12.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
