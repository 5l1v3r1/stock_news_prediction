Our recently announced private placement is scheduled to close in 2Q18. This will ensure we continue to have the financial depth to undertake the major projects we have underway.”\nSummary of first quarter 2018 consolidated results\nContract Backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $214 million, down 7% from $230 million at December 31, 2017. The Company expects its backlog to reach new record levels when the first two ride system contracts are executed under the previously announced strategic cooperation agreement with an Asian theme park owner. Revenues increased by $1.3 million (4%), to $33.7 million, from $32.4 million in 1Q17 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.6 million (52.3%), to $1.5 million from $3.1 million in 1Q17.
