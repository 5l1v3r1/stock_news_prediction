REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo\nThe red swamp crayfish, or Procambarus clarkii, are on the European Union’s list of invasive alien species but also popular in German aquariums.\nIt is likely some were abandoned by their owners and started multiplying in favorable weather conditions, the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union believes.
