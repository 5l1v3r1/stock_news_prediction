The central bank started raising interest rates last August, delivering three rate hikes so far.\nTo counter persisting pressure on profit margins and growing competition, Komercni Banka said it planned to update its strategy in the coming years to simplify, digitalise and accelerate customer processes in its retail and corporate segments.\nIt said implementation of its KB Change 2020 plan - under which it will adjust its retail network including closing 10-15 percent of branches - would bring a net positive financial contribution starting from 2019. It will also boost investments, mainly in digital channels, this year and next.\nIt added it was still assessing the scope of activities and investments under the plan.\n$1 = 21.2750 Czech crowns Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:16:16.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
