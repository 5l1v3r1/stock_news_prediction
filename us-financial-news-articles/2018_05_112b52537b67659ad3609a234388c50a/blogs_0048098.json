Companies that choose to leave Iran because the U.S. exited the nuclear deal are doing so for a number of reasons, sanctions experts say, including a need to stay in the U.S. market, potential banking problems or secondary sanctions.\nCompanies such as Total SA , A.P. Moller-Maersk and Allianz SE announced last week they were set to walk away from the business they started with Iran following the 2016 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. President Donald Trump earlier this month said the U.S. would leave the deal and re-impose all of the sanctions lifted as part of the agreement. The phase-in of those sanctions will occur over a six-month period, but some companies are accelerating their departures.\n“Many non-U.S. companies who have announced their intention to exit Iran must be experiencing deja-vu,” said Adam M. Smith, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn Crutcher LLP.\nCompanies saying they’re leaving Iran decided their market interests in the U.S. outweigh the potential of those in Iran, sanctions observers said.\n“They are motivated by preserving their access to the [U.S.] dollar economy,” said Sanjay Mullick, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.\nCompanies are afraid of the pain that comes from enforcing secondary sanctions, said Daniel Tannebaum, the leader of PwC’s global financial services sanctions practice. There isn’t much of a history of enforcing them, and there may not need to be. “The threat of secondary sanctions is enough to scare institutions and companies out of the market,” said Mr. Tannebaum.\nThat threat led Total to halt its work in Iran, said Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne, in an interview at the Center for Strategic and International Studies last week in Washington. “As soon as the U.S. decide to put back in place the secondary sanctions there is no possibility for us to be a major company, a global company,” he said.\nMr. Pouyanne said 90% of Total’s financing is linked to the U.S. financial system and secondary sanctions that block the firm from U.S. banks would make business impossible. “I cannot run a company in 130 countries without any access to any U.S. banks,” he said.\nThe banking issue is a very large concern, said Janet Kim, partner at the firm Baker McKenzie. Even during the nuclear deal banks were reticent to work in Iran, she said, but the U.S. walking away from the agreement makes them even more so.\nA company needs banking services to operate in Iran, she said. “If that infrastructure isn’t there, it’s almost impossible to continue to do business with Iran,” she said.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nColombian ex-anticorruption director extradited to U.S. The former Colombian national anticorruption director and a Colombian lawyer were extradited to face U.S charges.\nProsecutors said both Luis Gustavo Moreno Rivera, who was the Colombian national director of anticorruption, and Leonardo Luis Pinilla Gomez, an attorney practicing there, arrived Thursday in the U.S to face charges of laundering money related to foreign bribery. They were arrested in Colombia on an Interpol notice, prosecutors said.\nMr. Moreno’s lawyer said his client is glad to be in the U.S. to address the charges filed against him. A lawyer for Mr. Pinilla couldn’t immediately be reached.\nThe two men allegedly tried to orchestrate a scheme in which they received a fee to obstruct a separate corruption investigation into a Colombian governor who acted a U.S. cooperating source. The then-director of the anticorruption office had allegedly offered to inundate his prosecutors with work so they wouldn’t be able to focus on the investigation, prosecutors said. – Samuel Rubenfeld\nCOMPLIANCE\nChina praised a reduction in trade tensions with the U.S. after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that a trade war was “on hold” as the countries work on a wider trade agreement, Reuters reports.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News on Sunday that the U.S. was ‘putting the trade war on hold.’ PHOTO: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES Investigators have yet to issue their final report on a Southwest Airlines flight last month that led to a passenger’s death.
