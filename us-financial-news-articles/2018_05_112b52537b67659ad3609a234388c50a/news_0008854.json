These statements are only estimates or predictions and reflect our current beliefs and expectations. Actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in the estimates, projections or forward-looking statements. It is routine for internal projections and expectations to change as the quarter progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our expectations may change prior to the end of the quarter. Although these expectations may change, we will not necessarily inform you if they do. Our policy is to provide expectations not more than once per quarter, and not to update that information until the next quarter. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein include, without limitation, (i) our operating results may fluctuate, are difficult to predict and could fall below expectations, (ii) our ability to accurately measure and monetize the level of offline store level traffic attributable to an online digital campaign conducted on our sites, (iii) our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our business, (iv) our ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing business and/or fail to generate the results we are expecting, (v) if we are unable to continue to develop solutions that generate revenue from advertising and other services delivered to mobile devices, our business could be harmed, (vi) our businesses could be negatively affected by changes in Internet search engine and app store search algorithms and email marketing policies, (vii) we face intense competition in our markets. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected, (viii) our transactions business is dependent on third-party participants, whose lack of performance could adversely affect our results of operations, (ix) fraudulent or unlawful activities on our marketplace could harm our business and consumer confidence in our marketplace, (x) we may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content, (xi) we may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business, or prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks, and (xii) other factors detailed in documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes information about certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\" or \"U.S. GAAP\"), including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Our use of these terms may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.\nManagement defines its non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\nEBITDA represents GAAP income from operations adjusted to exclude, (1) interest, (2) tax, and (3) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP income from operations adjusted to exclude, if applicable: (1) interest, (2) tax, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) gains or losses in equity method investments, (5) stock-based compensation expense, (6) asset impairment charges, and (7) other items affecting comparability during the period. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA (as defined above), divided by total GAAP revenue. Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income, adjusted for items that impact comparability, which may include: (1) asset impairment charges, (2) executive separation and other severance charges, (3) use of an estimated long-term effective tax rate, (4) costs related to exit activities, and (5) other items affecting comparability during the period. Adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income (as defined above), divided by the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operations, less capital expenditures. National online advertising programs include display advertisements. Revenue from display advertisements is largely generated by sold impressions (the number of views or displays of a customer's advertisement, banner, link or other form of content on our online properties for which we earn revenue). Display advertising revenue per one thousand sold impressions derives our effective CPM (\"eCPM\"). Through our transactions business, we earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, or some combination thereof with respect to these transactions, which we refer to collectively as our \"take rate.\"\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under U.S. GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about our period-over-period growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating our operating performance. However, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered substitutes for or superior to net income, net income per diluted share, and net cash provided by operating activities as indicators of operating performance.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures is included in this press release.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xo-group-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300640703.html\nSOURCE XO Group Inc.", "external_links": ["http://ir.xogroupinc.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xo-group-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300640703.html"], "published": "2018-05-02T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:37:53.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
