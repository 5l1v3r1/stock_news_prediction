Most of the time, it’s caused by problems with ovulation, often related to a hormone imbalance known as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods.\nLess-common causes of infertility in women can include blocked fallopian tubes, structural problems with the uterus or uterine fibroids.\nThe risk increases with age, and can also be exacerbated by smoking, excessive drinking, stress, an unhealthy diet, too much exercise, being overweight or obese or having sexually transmitted infections.\nWomen in the current study were typically overweight and most of them ate fast food at least twice a week, the study team notes in Human Reproduction.\nResearchers also looked at how often women ate fruit and found that those who had it less than once a month took half a month longer to become pregnant than women who ate at least three fruit servings a day.\nWith the lowest fruit intake, the risk of infertility was 12 percent, compared to 8 percent with the highest fruit consumption.\nThe study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how the amount of fruit or fast food women consume might impact their fertility. Another limitation is that researchers relied on dietary questionnaires women completed during prenatal visits that asked them to recall how they ate in the month before they conceived - a method that isn’t always accurate.\n“A lot of maternal lifestyle factors are associated with infertility, like smoking, alcohol drinking or obesity,” said Dr. Joachim Dudenhausen, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.\nThe current study offers fresh evidence of the role diet can play in helping women conceive, Dudenhausen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.\n“There are some studies showing that preconception intake of fruits and fish increase fertility,” Dudenhausen said. “The study is in the same line and has clear data supporting the advice for women who wish to get pregnant to have greater intake of fruit and lower intake of fast food.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2Ic3Y6R Human Reproduction, online May 4, 3018.", "external_links": ["https://bit.ly/2Ic3Y6R"], "published": "2018-05-09T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T22:59:39.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
