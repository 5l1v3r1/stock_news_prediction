He expressed mild incredulity at Trump's questions about two well-known viruses.\n\"Both times he wanted to know if there was a difference between HIV and HPV, so I was able to explain that those are rarely confused with each other.\"\nA spokesperson for the White House was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nshow chapters Bill Gates says he's 'obsessed' with this new website — here's why 1 Hour Ago | 01:26 The questions apparently followed a conversation about the effects of vaccines, a topic that remains controversial in the U.S., where some people and lawmakers believe common immunization vaccinations are harmful.\n\"In both of those two meetings, he asked me if vaccines weren't a bad thing because he was considering a commission to look into ill effects of vaccines and somebody — I think it was Robert Kennedy Jr. — was advising him that vaccines were causing bad things.
