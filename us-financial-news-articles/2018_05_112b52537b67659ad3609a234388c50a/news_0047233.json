Michel , Editor-in-Chief of The Dark Report . “This White Paper focuses on providing the reader with a thorough understanding of RCM and compliance best practices, thus enabling laboratory leaders to increase the profitability of their businesses.”\nThis White Paper will be an invaluable tool for any clinical laboratory or pathology practice interested in progressing their laboratory business to the next level. Highlights from the paper include:\nUnderstanding the key metrics of lab profitability RCM challenges in the lab, including workflow processes, compliance & fee schedules, and coding challenges How to positively impact laboratory revenue through efficient revenue cycle management What to look for when choosing a best-in-class RCM system for the lab organization\nThe overall goal of the White Paper is to provide a useful roadmap on how the most effective use of RCM can help labs collect more money, improve their cash flow, and dramatically increase both profits and valuation as their practices face the unprecedented operational, financial, and revenue challenges that will likely continue to grow as lab reimbursement and operating margins continue to shrink.\nAll interested practices and laboratory professionals can download this exclusive FREE White Paper, “The Laboratory Executive’s Guide to Maximizing Revenue & Valuation: Effective Revenue Cycle and Compliance Management are Critical Success Factors,” by clicking here .
