It unlocked massive gains for Symantec puts, which convey the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future.\nIn particular, contracts betting on Symantec shares slipping below $25 by mid-January were big winners. Two thousand of these contracts, bought for $1.03 each on Thursday, were worth $6.54 each, on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nWith about 17,000 contracts open, the Jan. 25 puts made up the largest block of open Symantec contracts. The position has largely held steady since the beginning of April.\n“The interest in the deep out-of-the-money puts was a sign that some investors were bracing for a larger than usual move,” said Fred Ruffy, analyst at New York-based options analytics firm Trade Alert.\nGraphic: Jump in price of Symantec puts - reut.rs/2KdnT2A\n‘Deep out-of-the-money puts’ refer to contracts that are struck well below the trading price of a stock and require a sharp drop in the share price to become profitable.\nOver the last eight quarters, on average, Symantec shares logged a post-earnings swing of about 3 percent. On Thursday, options traders expected a roughly 7 percent swing after the latest earnings announcement.\n“As earnings come up there’s an amount that options traders expect a stock to move, and mostly it’s pretty close to historical moves,” said Matt Amberson, founder at Chicago-based volatility and options data firm ORATS.\n“Symantec was quite a bit higher,” said Amberson.\nOn Friday, Symantec options volume was nearly 133,000 contracts, or about 11 times its average daily volume, with bearish contracts dominant, according to Trade Alert.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://reut.rs/2KdnT2A", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-12T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:31:55.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
