We are pleased to complete this transaction, which is consistent with the central elements of our acquisition strategy. It builds on our already strong presence in New Mexico to give us market leading positions; it expands our scope of home care services in the market; and it is expected to be immediately accretive to our earnings. We are particularly excited to supplement our service offering with hospice services through this acquisition. Our management team has deep experience in the hospice industry, and we intend to continue to grow this segment of the business.\nThis transaction is the second large acquisition we have completed in the past 30 days. These deals reflect our growing acquisition pipeline, which we expect will continue to help us expand our market share and diversify our client base in targeted markets.
