It then backtracked somewhat and was trading at 9.6925 at 0824 GMT.\nMarkets interpreted the outlook as reasonably confident at a time when its European peers such as the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swedish central bank have struck a relatively more cautious note, ING economist Jonas Goltermann said.\n“The Norwegians are staying the course at a time when everybody else including the ECB is sounding a bit more cautious and that is being perceived as slightly more confident than its (the Norwegian central bank’s) peers,” he added.\nIn its statement, the bank said that underlying inflation was below the inflation target, but that “driving forces” indicated that it would rise.\nCore inflation year-on-year, which excludes the volatile oil and shipping sectors, fell to 1.2 percent in March from 1.4 percent in February, below expectations for a rise of 1.5 percent in a Reuters poll.\nThe finance ministry lowered in March the bank’s inflation target to 2.0 percent from 2.5 percent previously.\n“The low inflation from March is not influencing their judgement,” said SEB Chief Strategist Erica Blomgren.\n“In sum, the market has seen weaker data during the spring but the central bank does not give any impression that it will delay a rate hike.” (Reporting by Camilla Knudsen, Ole Petter Skonnord, and Terje Solsvik in Oslo and Tommy Wilkes in London Writing by Gwladys Fouche Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T11:27:09.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
