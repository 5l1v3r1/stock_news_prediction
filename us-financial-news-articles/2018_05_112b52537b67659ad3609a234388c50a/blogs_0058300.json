Last year, in comparison, they brought in nearly $17 billion, according to the Department of Transportation.\nDelta and its large competitors are battling low-cost, long-haul airlines like Norwegian Air Shuttle, WOW Air and others that have expanded in recent years as costs to fuel planes plunged. Fuel generally represents the biggest expense for low-cost airlines.\nBastian pointed to a nearly 15 percent uptick in its trans-Atlantic revenue in the first quarter and said it doesn't expect the business to be hurt by the new entrants.\n\"Customers that travel on those ultra-low cost carriers are people that otherwise would not be flying,\" he said.\nDelta and American , as well as their partners in Europe, are trying their hand at a similar low-cost model, however, offering no-frills basic economy tickets this year, which charge passengers around $60 to check a bag.\nBastian said it could take up to 12 months for higher fuel prices to show up in the airline's capacity or fares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T18:16:39.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
