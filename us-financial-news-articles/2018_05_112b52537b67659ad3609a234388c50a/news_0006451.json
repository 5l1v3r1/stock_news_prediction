The customs partnership looks pretty difficult to me. I don't see that the EU would agree to that and Britain able to cut its own trade deals in the future.\"\nMaude said that increased use of technology could be \"the better bet\" to allow goods to travel freely between the U.K. and the EU trading bloc, a strategy recommended by some Conservatives.\nHe also criticized the EU for asking British negotiators to find a better solution to the Brexit impasse.\n\"The (European) Commission is saying no. That's not on. They're saying it doesn't work,\" Maude said. \"Quite often on their position on Brexit is that they stake out a fact and say it's not a possibility when all they really mean is that they've decided that they don't want it.\"\nshow chapters Luxembourg's finance minister: Must avoid a 'cliff edge' Brexit 10 Hours Ago | 01:42 He urged the 27 EU member states to find a \"sensible, pragmatic deal with goodwill on both sides.\"\nMaude's own view on the 2016 Brexit vote is somewhat unusual. He wrote on a Tory blog last year: \"I took no part in the referendum campaign — I thought both sides massively exaggerated their case, and thought a vote to leave would mean some short-term economic downside through uncertainty.\"\nMay's Conservative party is deeply divided on whether there should be a future customs union with the EU. Trade Minister Liam Fox opposes any form of a customs union.\nAs the prime minister navigates complex Brexit negotiations, she was dealt another blow with the resignation of one of her closest allies Sunday.
