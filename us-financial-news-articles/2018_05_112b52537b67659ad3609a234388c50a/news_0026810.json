Vystar products will help create a perfect natural sleep environment starting with Vytex bedding made from the purest latex in the world and UV Flu’s RxAir ™ air purifier ensuring every breath is free of harmful pathogens, VOCs and odors.”\nUV Flu products use 48 inches of high-intensity germicidal UV lamps that destroy bacteria, viruses and other germs instead of just trapping them, setting it apart from ordinary air filtration units. RxAir is one of the few UV air purifiers that have been proven in independent EPA- and FDA-certified testing laboratories to destroy on the first pass 99.6% of harmful airborne viruses and bacteria. In addition to inactivating airborne viruses that cause influenza (flu) and colds, RxAir’s device disarms the airborne pathogens that cause MRSA (staph), strep (whooping cough), tuberculosis (TB), measles, pneumonia and a myriad of other antibiotic-resistant and viral infections. (see news video with RX3000 in use)\nUV Flu’s product line includes:\nRXair™ Residential Filterless Air Purifier UV400 ™ FDA cleared Class II Filterless Air Purifier RX3000 ™ Commercial FDA cleared Class II Air Purifier (news video with RX3000)\nVystar acquired all UV Flu intellectual property & multiple patents, product lines, tooling, FDA clearances, research data, websites and other assets related to the business for the purchase price of $975,000 or 27,918,000 shares of Vystar restricted common stock which may not be assigned or sold by UV Flu for 12 months. With the exchange of Vystar shares for UV Flu shares, Vystar will welcome UV Flu’s approximately 1,000 shareholders to the Vystar family.\nManufacturing, Distribution and Sales\nVystar will continue production of UV Flu product lines with BOI, a world-class manufacturer. Vystar anticipates it will take 45 days to complete manufacture of the next orders of air purifier units and another 45 days to relaunch sales with a new, more robust distribution model. Vystar plans to sell RxAir residential units via online and retail channels.\nVystar is assembling the distribution network to relaunch sales of UV400 and Rx3000 units to the healthcare and medical markets, which UV Flu had ceased due to sales force, distribution and cash flow constraints. Once production and sales are firmly re-established, Vystar expects that the air purification products will produce margins of approximately 75%.\n“UV Flu needed a larger infrastructure and capitalization in order to maintain inventory and market its products effectively,” stated Michael Ross, former CEO of UV Flu. “Vystar paid about twice our market cap, but gains far more, as our market cap does not accurately reflect the more than $8 million invested in the development of the product lines, intellectual property and FDA clearances that took a decade to secure. I believe this transaction will be a win for both sides as UV Flu shareholders look forward to seeing our products gain the market exposure they deserve and positively impact Vystar’s bottom line.”\n“UV Flu’s products have world class engineering, are made to the highest quality standards and are extremely effective in settings ranging from homes to offices, healthcare facilities, salons, restaurants and nursing homes – a credit to UV Flu’s management that worked tirelessly to see the product development through,” noted Mr. Rotman. “This is a unique opportunity for Vystar to bring another valuable, much needed product line to a broader marketplace. We are truly excited by the potential of this opportunity to greatly improve shareholder value and the quality of life of every customer .”\nTransaction details are available in Vystar’s 8-k financial filing at www.sec.gov .\nAbout RxAir\nRxAir promotes a healthy lifestyle through the use of its innovative, patented ViraTech air purification technology, thereby improving the quality of life of each and every customer.
