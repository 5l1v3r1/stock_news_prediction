The company has capacity to process around 22 million tonnes of cane per year.\nBunge entered the sugar and ethanol sector in Brazil in 2010, when it bought the holding Moema Participações, which controlled the then six mills.\nBrazil’s market regulator CVM confirmed Bunge’s listing request. The IPO prospectus is not yet available.
