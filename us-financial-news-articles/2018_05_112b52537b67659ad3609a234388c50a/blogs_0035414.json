To be more precise, his time frame is one to two years, or by 2020.\nAs a result, Cox recommended that investors insulate their portfolios with dividend stocks.\nNames that \"aren't necessarily recession-proof,\" he said. \"But they tend to be resilient.\"\n\"Mobile services are a perfect example, because the last thing you're going to do during a recession is turn off your phone,\" Cox said.\nCompanies with solid fundamentals are a buying opportunity as interest rates rise and prices drop during sell-offs, he said.\n\"There's no business condition causing the stocks to fall,\" Cox said. \"It's just the interest rates. So they'll go back up again.\"\nSome sectors to consider are telecom, utilities and consumer staples, Cox said. He recommended Duke Energy , Dominion Energy , AT&T , Verizon and Procter & Gamble .\nCox pointed out that a company like Procter & Gamble was performing badly year to date. \"But people need toothpaste,\" he said. \"Like any other investment,\" Cox said, \"it doesn't necessarily pay off right away. What you're trying to do is build your portfolio for income or whatever you're trying to do for the future.\"\nOn Tuesday, stocks fell , with all major indexes opening lower. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 200 points, the S&P 500 shed 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite declined 0.8 percent.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield , hit its highest level since 2011 on Tuesday, at 3.09 percent.\nIn addition, many market watchers fear the Federal Reserve will raise rates for a fourth time this year .\nBut Cox said the likelihood is small.\nAt some point the positive effects for companies from the Republican tax law are going to wear off and some of those corporations \"are going to stop buying things,\" Cox said. \"That's going to cause a recession or slowdown in the economy.\"\nHe warns investors not to assume, \"stocks are going to stay up forever.\"\n\"They're not going to,\" Cox said. \"Particularly the high-flying ones. If there is a recession, the things that have been bid up the most are going to get hit the worst.\" Kellie Ell News Associate for CNBC Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T23:20:48.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
