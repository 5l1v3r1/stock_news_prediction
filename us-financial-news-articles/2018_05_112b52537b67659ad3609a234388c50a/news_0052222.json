She arrived in Paris in 1865, and she was very important, in the very heart of French Impressionists,” exhibition curator Pierre Curie said\nShe is known in particular for paintings of women and children, often in domestic surroundings.\n“She’s not exactly a typical Impressionist because landscape is the heart of the Impressionist. She is like Degas. She is a figure painter. What interests her is the human being, and especially the mother and the children.”\nThe exhibition runs until July 23.\nReporting by Feyi Adegbite; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:19:59.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
