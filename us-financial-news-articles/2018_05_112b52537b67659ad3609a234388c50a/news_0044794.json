In return, the board will not push to eliminate Christmas bonuses or reduce sick days, the statement said.\nIn a separate statement Monday morning, the board said it planned to revise accordingly the island’s fiscal turnaround blueprint, which Rossello had opposed, avoiding litigation over its implementation.
