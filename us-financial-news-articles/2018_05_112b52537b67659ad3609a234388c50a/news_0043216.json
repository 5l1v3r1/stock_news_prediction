If there are (strikes), we will take them as we have in Germany and Portugal. Being unionized means we will have occasional strikes,” O’Leary said in a video presentation following quarterly results.\nO’Leary added that he expected to finalize pilot recognition agreements in Spain and Germany in the next few months and that Ryanair was also on track to sign its first cabin crew recognition agreements in a month or two.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T16:14:33.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
