REUTERS/Altaf Hussain Falih told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event in Seoul that South Korea could expect a “good result” when asked about outcome of bidding on the project, without going into details.\nSaudi Arabia, the world’s top oil producer, plans to build two nuclear plants to diversify its energy supply and has been in talks with companies from South Korea, the United States, Russia and China for the tender.\nShould South Korea win the bid, it would be the country’s second nuclear exports deal. In 2009, a consortium led by state-run utility Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) clinched its first nuclear exports deal with the United Arab Emirates.\nFalih met South Korean President Moon Jae-in and South Korean Energy Minister Paik Un-gyu to expand bilateral cooperation in energy and other sectors.\nReporting By Jane Chung; Editing by Tom Hogue/David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T11:58:49.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
