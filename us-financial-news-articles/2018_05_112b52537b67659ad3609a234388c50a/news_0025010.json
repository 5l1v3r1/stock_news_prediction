(Nasdaq:CTMX), a clinical-stage oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company pioneering a novel class of investigational antibody therapeutics based on its Probody™ therapeutic technology platform, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results.\nAs of March 31, 2018, CytomX had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $361.5 million.\n“CytomX’s first quarter marked the continued execution across our clinical pipeline, our discovery stage programs and in our partnerships,” said Sean McCarthy, D.Phil., president and chief executive officer of CytomX Therapeutics. “We remain on track to share initial Probody clinical data at ASCO from PROCLAIM-CX-072, a broad-based study of our lead and wholly-owned anti-PD-L1 Probody therapeutic and we look forward to providing additional pipeline updates as the year progresses.”\nBusiness Highlights and Recent Developments\nPROCLAIM-CX-072 (PD-L1 Probody Therapeutic) Clinical Program\nCX-072 is a Probody therapeutic targeting PD-L1, a clinically- and commercially-validated anti-cancer target. Initial clinical data from the Phase 1/2 PROCLAIM-CX-072 program will be presented on Monday June 4, from 8:00 – 11:30 a.m. as part of the Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy session at the ASCO Annual Meeting. Abstract 3071 - Preliminary Results of the First-In-Human, Dose-Finding PROCLAIM-072 Trial of the PD-L1 Probody Therapeutic CX-072 as Monotherapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Abstract 3072 - Preliminary Interim Results of the First-In-Human, Dose-Finding PROCLAIM-072 Trial of the PD-L1 Probody Therapeutic CX-072 in Combination with Ipilimumab in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors The data presented at the meeting will reflect a data cutoff approximately five months later than the abstract submission data cutoff, and therefore, will include longer term follow up as well data from additional patients.\nPROCLAIM-CX-2009 (CD166 Probody Drug Conjugate) Clinical Program\nCX-2009 is a Probody drug conjugate (PDC) that targets CD166, an antigen that is broadly and highly expressed in many types of cancer. Preliminary data from Part A of the PROCLAIM-CX-2009 Phase 1/2 clinical program is expected to be presented in the second half of 2018.\nCX-2029 (CD71 Probody Drug Conjugate) Preclinical Program\nCytomX, in collaboration with AbbVie, is advancing CX-2029, a CD71-directed PDC. CytomX filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for CX-2029 in April 2018. CytomX expects the initiation of clinical trials in the third quarter of 2018.\nCX-188 (PD-1 Probody Therapeutic) Preclinical Program\nCytomX is advancing CX-188, a PD-1-directed Probody therapeutic, through IND-enabling studies. CytomX expects to file an IND application for CX-188 in the second half of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $361.5 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $374.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nRevenue was $14.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $11.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.9 million relating to the recognition of $6.3 million of the upfront payment received from BMS in connection with an amendment of the Company’s Collaboration and License Agreement entered into in March 2017, offset by $1.2 million in revenue recognized resulting from a reduction in research terms during the three months ended March 31, 2017; an increase of $1.3 million resulting from a change in revenue recognition for the Company’s CD71 Agreement with AbbVie from the straight-line method under the prior revenue recognition standard to the percentage-of-completion method under the new revenue recognition standard, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2018; an increase of $1.3 million related to the Amgen Agreement, which the Company entered into at the end of September 2017; and an increase of $0.9 million resulting primarily from the recognition of the remaining upfront payments resulting from the termination of the Company’s agreement with Pfizer in March 2018. These increases were offset by a decrease of $5.8 million related to ImmunoGen due primarily to the recognition of $6.5 million upon delivery of a Development and Commercialization License to ImmunoGen during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and development expenses increased $7.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3.5 million in lab contracts and services, consulting expenses and clinical trial startup fees to advance CX-188 and CX-2029 through IND-enabling studies, an increase of $2.2 million in CX-072 resulting from increased clinical trial activities, and an increase of $2.0 million in personnel-related expenses due to an increase in headcount.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $1.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was attributable to an increase of $0.8 million in personnel-related expense due to an increase in headcount, an increase of $0.4 million in stock-based compensation resulting from an increase in headcount and an increase in the average price of the Company’s common stock and an increase of $0.4 million in consulting services primarily due to an increase in tax and accounting compliance activities.\nAbout CytomX Therapeutics\nCytomX Therapeutics is a clinical-stage oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company pioneering a novel class of investigational antibody therapeutics based on its Probody therapeutic technology platform. Probody therapeutics are designed to exploit unique conditions of the tumor microenvironment to more effectively localize antibody binding and activity while limiting activity in healthy tissues. The Company’s pipeline includes cancer immunotherapies against clinically-validated targets, such as CX-072, a PD-L1-targeting Probody therapeutic wholly owned by CytomX, CX-188, a PD-1-targeting Probody therapeutic wholly owned by CytomX and BMS-986249, a CTLA-4-targeting Probody therapeutic partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb. The pipeline also includes first-in-class Probody drug conjugates against highly attractive targets, such as CX-2009, a CD166-targeting Probody drug conjugate wholly owned by CytomX, and CX-2029, a CD71-targeting Probody drug conjugate partnered with AbbVie, which are considered to be inaccessible to conventional antibody drug conjugates due to their presence on healthy tissue. In addition to its wholly owned programs, CytomX has strategic collaborations with AbbVie, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and ImmunoGen, Inc.
