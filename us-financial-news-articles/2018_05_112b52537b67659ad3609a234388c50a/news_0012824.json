Some said they could not replace staff who left due to a lack of qualified applicants. Others said higher employment costs meant they were seeking to squeeze more from existing staff.\nPassing higher costs on to consumers was getting harder, firms said, as they raised prices at the joint-slowest rate since July.\nThe survey gave a mixed view of the future. Business confidence was the highest since January, but the inflow of new orders was the second-weakest since August 2016.\nEditing by Hugh Lawson\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:42:47.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
