But all the same Serena was too strong, too good, simply too Serena for her world 70-ranked opponent.\nIt was a match-up that, in some respects, made a mockery of statistics. The American started the match ranked 9,999th in the race to the annual season-ender. Pliskova sits 52nd.\nBut in the data that counts, Serena is a giant of the tennis court. Her haul of 23 Grand Slam singles crowns beats Steffi Graf’s total by one, and is just one shy of Margaret Court’s record 24.\nComing into this tournament her career prize money stood at more than $84 million. That she is currently ranked 451 in the WTA rankings is an irrelevance - more pertinent is that she finished 2017 ranked 22, having played only two events all year.\nSlideshow (3 Images) In every category, Serena’s achievements dwarf her opponent’s, bar one — Pliskova holds the WTA record for aces in a single match: 31 at the 2016 Australian Open.\nShe cracked 15 past Serena on Court Philippe Chatrier, but even then saw 13 fly past her as the American gave as good as she got.\n“I don’t know how many aces there were,” Serena smiled courtside after the match. “But I think money goes to charity, so donate!\n“I think we raised some real money,” she laughed before making her way to the exit, stopping for selfies and to sign autographs for an appreciative French crowd.\nNext up for the three-times champion is Australian 17th seed Ashleigh Barty.\nIt won’t be an encounter Barty will relish. She could be considered the most unlucky of seeds in a Grand Slam, for there can never have been a more dangerous floater in the draw.\nFrench Open organizers stick rigidly to the WTA rankings, so would not seed Serena. That is already beginning to look like a mistake Wimbledon — which allows itself some ‘wriggle-room’ — would be wise to avoid repeating.\nEditing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:30:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
