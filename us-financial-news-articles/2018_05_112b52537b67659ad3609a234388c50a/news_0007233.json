With an EBIT of EUR 1.2 million, the Group believes they are well positioned to maintain momentum, comments CEO Hickson.\nYou can pay with Mash almost anywhere\nBuy almost anything with Mash, pay by invoice later\nMash volume growth 2016-2018\nMash Group Oyj Executive Chairman Tommi Lindfors\nYes is better than No!\nMash Group Plc CEO James Hickson\n2nd May 2018 - Mash continued to grow rapidly in all markets during the first quarter, with new daily, weekly and monthly records in January, February and March.\nFinancial Highlights\nLending volumes in Q1/18 were 31% higher than in Q4/17, and 142% higher than Q1/17. Revenues increased by 23% from the previous quarter and 78% compared to Q1/17, while EBIT increased 204% and 149%, correspondingly. The Group’s solidity remains excellent, with equity increasing by 32% compared to the previous quarter and 78% compared to Q1/17, raising the equity ratio to 42%. Total assets grew by 23% (Q4/17) and 70% (Q1/17).\n“Today, our average monthly volumes are over two and a half times that of Q1 2017 and three times compared to Q1 2016”, says Group CEO James Hickson. “This is a testament to the bold decisions we made in 2017 to reposition our products, invest in our people and focus on developing strong partnerships that help drive sustainable growth moving forward. The changes we made to our product – shifting away from upfront fees to interest-based pricing – increases revenue over time, and we expect to benefit from that in 2018.”\n“We are also happy with the investment we have made with our pay later solution in Finland, which is now available in thousands of stores with plans to launch in more markets in 2018. There is work still to do, and we continue to explore potential collaboration opportunities with established market players to build new capabilities, but we believe we are well positioned moving forward.”\nTommi Lindfors, Chairman of Mash Group added, “We made significant progress to grow our equity to 42% of our total balance sheet. This underscores the belief from our new and existing investors in our go-forward business and strategy, which is today ratified by our Q1 result.”\nThe Group confirmed that they will communicate Q2 2018 figures on Monday 13 th of August.\nInterim Financial Statement\nQ1/2018 Q4/2017 Q1/2017 ASSETS NON-CURRENT ASSETS Intangible assets 32 312 188 28 290 829 20 517 459 Tangible assets 18 484 17 266 25 779 Investments 3 812 541 0 TOTAL NON-CURRENT ASSETS 36 143 213 28 308 094 20 543 237 CURRENT ASSETS Current receivables 76 229 506 61 015 416 43 163 140 Cash and Bank Receivables 7 897 345 8 555 895 7 013 571 TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS 84 126 850 69 571 311 50 176 711 TOTAL ASSETS 120 270 064 97 879 406 70 719 948 EQUITY & LIABILITIES EQUITY Share capital and issue 80 000 80 000 80 000 Translation difference -455 014 96 287 -4 652 Reserve for invested non-restricted equity 50 325 913 33 179 019 21 463 289 Retained earnings 224 387 6 730 119 6 903 866 Profit for the Financial period 88 731 -2 092 199 -163 832 TOTAL EQUITY 50 264 017 37 993 227 28 278 671 LIABILITIES Non-current Liabilities 13,835,000 26 550 000 7 704 750 Current liabilities 56,171,046 33 336 179 34 736 527 TOTAL LIABILITIES 70 006 046 59 886 179 42 441 277 TOTAL EQUITY & LIABILITIES 120 270 064 97 879 406 70 719 948\nINCOME STATEMENT Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 TURNOVER 5 033 1 30 4 098 580 2 827 072 Other operating income 4 285 2 643 310 Materials and services -154 615 -193 498 -116 399 Personnel costs -855 962 -674 049 -347 891 Depreciation -901 284 -789 444 -506 994 Other business-related costs -1 972 097 -2 064 300 -1 393 153 EBIT 1 153 457 379 932 462 945 Financial income and expenses -1 054 633 -1 206 437 -619 230 EBT 98 824 -826 505 -156 285 Tax -10 093 7 940 -7 547 Net Profit 88 731 -818 565 -163 832 The interim financial figures and any comparison figures provided are unaudited.
