Smoke rose from several parts of the sleepy port city near the tip of the Indian peninsula.\nTwo local police officials confirmed the violence. “We are trying to control it,” one of the officials said.\n“The vehicles at an apartment where our employees live were set on fire by the protesters. They tried attacking the apartment, but police arrived and stopped them from causing further damage,” the Vedanta official said.\nThe plant, which can produce 400,000 tonnes of copper a year, has been shut for more than 50 days and will remain shut until at least June 6, because the local pollution regulator will not allow it to operate due to alleged non-compliance with environmental rules.\nSome activists and politicians want the government to shut the plant down permanently.\n“The inaction of the government has led to the people’s protests, and police resorting to firing to control it. Action should be taken to shutdown the plant immediately to address this issue,” M.K. Stalin, leader of the main opposition group in Tamil Nadu, said in a Facebook post.\nLocal media have reported that police have fired on the protesters and that at least person has died.\nState Minister D. Jayakumar in a televised address on Tuesday said police have fired on protesters and that it was “unavoidable”. Police officials have declined to comment on the matter. A Vedanta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. The company has previously said the protests are based on “false allegations” and that it plans to double capacity at the smelter to 800,000 tonnes per year.\nThe plant was shut more than two months in 2013 by an Indian environmental court after residents complained about emissions.
