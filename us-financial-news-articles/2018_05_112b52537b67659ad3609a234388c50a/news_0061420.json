WCG 0.49% has reached a deal to buy Meridian, which operates a pharmacy-benefit manager and health plans in Illinois and Michigan, for $2.5 billion in cash.\nThe transaction allows Tampa, Fla.-based WellCare to expand its government-sponsored health plans by adding Michigan, where Meridian has the No. 1 Medicaid market position, and grow its Medicaid business in Illinois, the companies said Tuesday. The deal is expected to close by year’s end.\nThe purchase is the latest in a string of insurance-sector deals in recent months. Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp. has announced it plans to buy Aetna Inc., while Cigna Corp. plans to buy pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co.\nMeridian is a family-owned organization that serves about 1.1 million members in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Meridian expects to generate more than $4.3 billion in revenue in 2018.\nAs of March 31, WellCare served about 4.3 million members nationwide.\nThe acquisition is expected to add between 40 cents and 50 cents to WellCare’s adjusted earnings per share in 2019, 70 cents to 80 cents in 2020, and more than $1 in 2021.\nWellCare expects to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand, tapping an existing credit line and new debt and equity offerings.\nFounded in 1997, Detroit-based Meridian is owned by the Cotton family. It was founded by Dr. David Cotton and his wife in 1997. Their three sons are Meridian executives.\nThe Cotton family doesn’t intend to stay on if the deal closes, WellCare executives said during a conference call with investors late Tuesday. WellCare would inherit $400 million in statutory capital from Meridian, which has no debt, WellCare executives said. The deal would mean WellCare would see about $200 million in tax benefits.\nShares of WellCare, which have gained 28% over the past year, were unchanged at $221.15 in after-hours trading Tuesday.\nWrite to Aisha Al-Muslim at aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T03:12:43.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
