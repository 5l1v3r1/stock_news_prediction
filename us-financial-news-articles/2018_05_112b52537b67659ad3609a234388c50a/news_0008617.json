The new strategy is simply to build on the employee expertise, outstanding products, and the expanded reach to better serve both existing and new business partners.\nThis acquisition puts Oversea DeWied International in line with the consolidation trend in the sausage casing industry. When merged, the new entity will maintain headquarters in Seattle, Washington, subsidiaries in San Antonio, Texas, Mexico City, Mexico, British Columbia, Canada, and Jiangsu province, China, as well as a state of the art production facility in Piedras Negras, Mexico. Combined total employees will top out over 125 not including contractors.\n“This bigger and stronger base of operations will help facilitate several initiatives,” Mayo said. “We will be better able to quickly and effectively conduct business across the entire North American continent, as well as internationally, utilizing many economies of scale that will make us more efficient and ultimately more profitable.”\nTotal production and distribution will more than double upon completion of the deal. According to David Mayo, VP of Sales, “Oversea Casing and DeWied will serve our customers with the biggest and best sales and customer service team in North America. Increased production across all product lines including hog casings, sheep casings and artificial casings will allow for exponential growth.”\nHoward de Wied, President and CEO of DeWied International said, “Oversea Casing was by far the best partner to join forces with. Our family business has always deeply cared about our customers, vendors and employees and the team at Oversea Casing shares these core values. We are confident we are leaving our stakeholders in good hands.”\nAs a result of this acquisition, Oversea DeWied International will become the largest American owned casing company, and with strong partners and contractors on the supply, production and distribution side, they will be poised to make a mark in the sausage casing industry, both domestically and internationally.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430006559/en/\nEcho Communications\nGinny Hair, 925-298-7262\ncell: 510-612-5609\nginnyh@echopr.com\nSource: Oversea DeWied International LLC", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430006559/en/"], "published": "2018-05-01T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T04:11:51.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
