The legs are feeling good and I’ve been feeling better and better as the race has gone on.\n“Hopefully we can finish it off tomorrow.” Reporting by Simon Jennings and Martyn Herman; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:59:21.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
