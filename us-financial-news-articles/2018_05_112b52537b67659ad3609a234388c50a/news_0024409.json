But users whose status is on stable love relationship can't use this feature.\nZuckerberg said \"there are around 0.2 billion Facebook users whose emotional status is Single, so it's obvious that Facebook can do something for them\" The market holds an positive view to this new feature, cause the Dating feature gives the advertisers a new chance.

Zuckerberg hopes this kind of responsibility can help to rebuild the public's confidence to Facebook.\n[Zuckerberg] \"We are all here because we are optimistic about the future. we have real challenges to address, but we have to keep that sense of optimism too. What I leant this year is that we need to take a broader view of responsibility. It's not enough to just build powerful tools, but we also need to make sure they are used for good. and we will.\"\nNew feature and new regulation are 2 major developing trends for Facebook, but will they bring more profit to Facebook and prevent Facebook from data leakage scandal?
