Cottarelli had been expected to announce his stopgap government’s cabinet after those talks.\nA source close to the president said Cottarelli had made no mention in the meeting of an intention to give up his mandate and that he was simply finalising his cabinet lineup.\nMajor parties, though, sensed Cottarelli’s mission was all but dead and called for parliament to be dissolved immediately.\n“It would be best to go to elections as quickly as possible, as early as July,” said Andrea Marcucci, senate leader for the centre-left Democratic Party.\nEarlier, Italy suffered its biggest market selloff in years on fears that repeat elections would become a proxy vote on euro membership.

Italian Presidential Press Office/Handout via REUTERS\nThe president had looked to Cottarelli as prime minister to calm political and market turmoil, which Italy’s two anti-establishment parties blame on the president himself after Mattarella vetoed their choice for economy minister in their would-be coalition government.\nMattarella blocked Paolo Savona as unsuitable on the grounds he had argued Italy should be prepared to quit the euro.\nThe 5-Star Movement and the far-right League, the biggest winners from the March election, declined to nominate an alternative candidate and abandoned plans to form a government, switching back into election mode, with 5-Star Movement calling for Mattarella to be impeached.\nOther euro zone countries are concerned about the turmoil in the currency bloc’s third-largest economy. French President Emmanuel Macron defended what he called Mattarella’s courage and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of the need to obey rules governing the euro.\nBut top EU officials were quick to play down a comment from Germany’s European commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, who said he hoped the market turmoil would be “a signal (to Italians) not to hand governing responsibilities to the populists”.\nCommission President Jean-Claude Juncker released a statement saying: “Italy’s fate does not lie in the hands of the financial markets,” and Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders’ summits, called on EU institutions to “respect the voters ... We are there to serve them, not to lecture them.”\nEven if Cottarelli were able to form an interim government acceptable to the splintered Italian parliament, investors believe he would fail to pass the 2019 budget, triggering a snap election in the autumn.\nThe election campaign is likely to centre on Italy’s relationship with the European Union and in particular the budget restraints imposed on members of the euro zone. Slideshow (5 Images)\nA poll by SWG showed support for the League had jumped to 27.5 percent, up about 10 points from the March 4 elections. With support for 5-Star falling about three points to 29.5 percent, the two combined would have a majority in parliament if they decided to join forces again.
