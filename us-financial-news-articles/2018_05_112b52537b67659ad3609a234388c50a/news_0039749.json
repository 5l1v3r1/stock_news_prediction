Soccer Football - Europa League Final - Olympique de Marseille vs Atletico Madrid - Groupama Stadium, Lyon, France - May 16, 2018 Atletico Madrid players celebrate with the trophy after winning the Europa League REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\nThe scoreline mirrored the Spanish side’s last Europa League final win over Athletic Bilbao in 2012 and cemented their status as one of the continent’s most consistent teams since Argentine coach Diego Simeone transformed their fortunes.\nThe only side to overcome them in knockout European football since 2013 are arch-rivals Real Madrid, who beat them in the 2014 and 2016 Champions League finals and knocked them out of the same competition in 2015 and 2017.\n“They are an attacking team they work very well but we focussed on our game, which was to defend well, be a tough team and take advantage of their mistakes,” Griezmann told reporters.

We lost a great player at set-pieces, if there’s one part of the game where we could have been dangerous, it would have been set- pieces.” AUTOMATIC ROUTE\nAs well as missing out on a first European trophy since winning the Champions League in 1993, Garcia’s side squandered an automatic route back into Europe’s elite competition.\nThey now must overhaul third-placed Olympique Lyonnais, who they trail by one point in the Ligue 1 standings heading into the final weekend of the season.\nPropelled by the fervent supporters who had waited 14 years to reach another European final, the French side created two early chances but striker Germain and defender Adil Rami both missed the target.\nAtletico were happy to sit back in the opening stages and had one half chance which Koke skewed wide but they picked an opportune moment to strike and Griezmann’s goal against the run seriously wounded Marseille.\nThe French side looked even more lost when Payet went off and Griezmann’s supremely well-taken second goal effectively finished them off.\nMarseille substitute Kostas Mitroglou struck the post with a fine late header but Atletico enjoyed a dream end to the game as captain Gabi netted the third goal and long-serving forward Fernando Torres came on for the last few minutes to end his long wait for a first trophy with his beloved club.
