The summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty right now and that's reflected in the tight trading band we've been in for the past few months,\" said Jennifer Ellison, principal at Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough.\nStocks traded higher earlier in the session after China said it will reduce levies on automakers and car parts. China's Finance Ministry said tariffs on certain vehicles will come down to 15 percent from as much as 25 percent while levies on some parts will be brought down to 6 percent effective July 1.\nShares of Ford and General Motors rose on the news, gaining 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.

The Dow also closed above 25,000 for the first time since March on Monday.\nRising trade tensions between the U.S. and China, coupled with rising rates and inflationary fears, pushed stocks off of record highs earlier this year. Since then, the major indexes have recovered slightly from those losses.\nHowever, Steve Chiavarone of Federated Investors said he was not too worried about the rising tensions between the two giant economies, noting the amount of money in tariffs proposed is far smaller than the benefit of lower taxes. \"It's like 20 to 1,\" the firm's assistant vice president said.\nWatch: The market's 'fear gauge' may be signaling caution for stocks show chapters The market’s ‘fear gauge’ may be signaling caution for stocks 21 Hours Ago | 01:19", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:24:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
