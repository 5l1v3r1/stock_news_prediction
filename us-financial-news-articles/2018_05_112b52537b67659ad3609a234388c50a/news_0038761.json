Banks tend to benefit as interest rates rise.\nBond funds absorbed $3.4 billion. However, emerging debt recorded its fourth straight week of outflow, shedding $1.3 billion. Junk-rated bonds, also considered vulnerable to higher U.S. borrowing costs, also saw a second week of outflows.\nBAML said, however, there were signs the Treasury yield rise could be approaching its end, noting $400 million in redemptions from financials stocks, bring three-week losses to $1.6 billion.\n“This is important as the reversal in flows to financials funds preceded the peak in bond yields in both 2013 and 2017,” the bank added.\nTo view a graphic on Financials flows and bond yields, click: reut.rs/2KwALRF Reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Toby Chopra", "external_links": ["https://reut.rs/2KwALRF"], "published": "2018-05-18T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:02:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
