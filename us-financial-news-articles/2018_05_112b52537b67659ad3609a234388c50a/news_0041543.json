There several crucial factors that drive the growth of the medical cannabis market, including growing recognition of medical benefits, increasing demand for cannabis in the treatment of various diseases, and growing number of research and development activities. In the U.S, there are 28 states which have approved the use of cannabis for medical purposes. In major markets like Colorado, California, Alaska, Massachusetts and Nevada, cannabis is also legal for recreational use. Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions (OTC: REFG), Freedom Leaf Inc.

(OTC: GLDFF)\nIn the U.S., the potential financial benefits from legalization are important economically and politically. Fortune reported that, \"in order to collect $1 billion a year in taxes, the state will need to reach a projected $7 billion in annual legal recreational cannabis sales. At that rate, California would easily be the country's largest legal marijuana market, as the entire legal cannabis industry in the U.S. is expected to pull in roughly $10 billion in total sales for 2017. That number would almost certainly get a boost in the coming years, as legal markets grow in California and other states, such as Nevada and Massachusetts.\"\nMedical Cannabis Payment Solutions (OTC: REFG) yesterday announced breaking news that, it has acquired SpeedyGrow, a Wyoming corporation with licenses to grow and process hemp in the state of Colorado.

We believe the future is bright for our combined company.\"\n\"We continue to focus on our core competency, which is providing best-in-class payment processing and banking services,\" said Mr. Roberts. \"This acquisition is yet another revenue stream for our investors.\"\nFreedom Leaf Inc.
