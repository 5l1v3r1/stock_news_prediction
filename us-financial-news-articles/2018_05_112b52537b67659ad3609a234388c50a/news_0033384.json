It last traded at $1.1868.\nDiscussions on forming a new government in Italy to end nine weeks of political stalemate are continuing and could remain a source of market volatility.\nItalian government bond yields jumped to a seven-week high on an increased possibility that a government of anti-establishment parties comes into power in the euro zone’s third largest economy.\nThe British pound hovered above Monday’s four-month low as traders expect the Bank of England to keep rates on hold at its meeting later in the day as a weak UK economic data and renewed worries about Brexit have led markets to price out the possibility of a rate hike this month.\nThe pound was up 0.1 percent at $1.3561 not far from $1.3485 touched on Monday.\nThe New Zealand dollar shed as much as 1.1 percent to a five-month low of $0.6916 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand held interest rates steady and said the next move in rates could just as easily be a cut as a hike.
