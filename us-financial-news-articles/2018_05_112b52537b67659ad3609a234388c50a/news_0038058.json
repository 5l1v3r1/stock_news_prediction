Photo: REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\nThis is a weekly commentary by external experts.\nThe chief executive of carrier Air France-KLM said he would resign after workers rejected a contract offer earlier this month and extended their strike into a third week. The airline’s stock price fell more than 13% on May 7 following news CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac would step down; the stock price is down by half since its January peak. Mr. Janaillac was brought in to run the airline group, including Air France and KLM, less than two years ago. At the time, the firm’s board cited his experience handling delicate labor negotiations as CEO of train and bus operator Transdev.\nAir France-KLM issued three press releases. A May 4 release included news of the worker contract vote and Mr. Janaillac’s decision to resign. [Mr. Janaillac] “will convene meetings with the Air France-KLM and Air France Boards of Directors on 9 May and will submit his resignation,” the airline said. “It will be their [board's] responsibility to take the appropriate measures to ensure the continuity of the group and Air France during the transition period.”\nA statement on May 5 reaffirmed the Mr. Janaillac’s decision to step aside despite board members reiterating their “full and total support” for him. A May 15 release made Mr. Janaillac’s resignation official and announced an interim leadership structure.\nThree crisis-management experts evaluate the company’s public communications.\nConroy Boxhill, founder and chief problem solver, Gladiator RMS: “Public negotiations are always difficult but Air France-KLM’s situation is particularly challenging because it pits employee outcry and nationality against business practicality and survival. With so much on the line it’s important to stick to the facts, which the company aptly did in its May 4th statement. However, more consideration should probably have been given to the messaging officially announcing the CEO’s intent to resign.\n“In a span of 24 hours the company issued two statements that provided no consistency to help move the situation forward. First, [it said that] Mr. Janaillac intended to resign and the issues are now the board’s problem; then the very next day saying the board regrettably accepted his resignation but reiterated its “full and total support” of Mr. Janaillac.\n“Hindsight is always 20/20 but as a general rule it’s never a good idea to announce a CEO’s departure of this magnitude without clear messaging about how you intend to move forward. In the coming weeks the company must reinforce its commitment to resolving the issue and instill a sense of confidence that there can be a path forward.”\nLanny Davis and Josh Galper, partners in law firm Davis Goldberg & Galper and communications firm Trident DMG: “Air France needs a strong message to withstand the turbulence of this crisis and its message thus far appears to be no message…beyond the government and others saying Air France may disappear if wage increases are allowed.\n“Air France would fare better if they offered facts on profits and losses, the actual wage increases being requested, the cost of those increases to the carrier and all other downstream financial consequences. Importantly, Air France needs to do a better job explaining why it is that it cannot afford to pay those increased wages and costs.\n“Resignations and personnel changes might demonstrate action but they are meaningless without getting to the heart of the issue. In this case silence seems to be the strategy and the stock drop is the verdict on why this strategy won’t fly.”\nLaura Guitar, executive vice president crisis and issues, Rbb Communications: “As Mr. Janaillac took the reins of Air France-KLM…a collection of labor issues combined with urgency to improve the airline’s financial performance set the stage for a complicated leadership mandate. Yet, prior to his resignation, Mr. Janaillac was successful in improving the company’s operations, finances and competitive position. He obviously experienced less-favorable outcomes in labor negotiations.\n“The board’s post-resignation statement expressing “full and total support” for him illustrates its prioritization of financial outcomes over labor-issue resolution. It’s unlikely then that striking workers will place much faith in the board’s “interim governance solution.” The comment by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire that the airline could “disappear” as the result of the strike–regardless of its accuracy–is equally unlikely to move workers off the picket line.\n“If the next CEO is going to be successful it will be critical to have the visible support of the board and government in aggressive bridge building, sustained education efforts and cultivation of labor leaders who understand the real risk at which Air France finds itself.”\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@wsj.com, and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.\nShare this: Air France-KLM contact talks crisis of the week labor Marc Janaillac strike union workers Previous Chinese Bank Unit to Pay Over Money-Laundering Compliance Content from our sponsor Deloitte Risk management, strategy and analysis from Deloitte Why Sustainability Is a Board-level Risk Sustainability, which encompasses environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, is increasingly positioned at the top of board agendas as investors’ expectations continue to increase.
