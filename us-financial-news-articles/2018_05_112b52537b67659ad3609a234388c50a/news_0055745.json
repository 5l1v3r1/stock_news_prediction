JPMC’s shares closed at 3.3 dinars on Sunday.\nCanada’s Potash Corp and Japan’s Mitsubishi were also in the running to buy the stake, an industry source familiar with the deal said.\nJPMC is one of the largest producers of phosphates in the world, producing up to seven million tonnes a year of rock phosphates, used as to make crop fertilizers.\nThe company has in the last two decades expanded joint ventures with Indian and Japanese firms seeking investment opportunities overseas to secure requirements to meet fast growing fertiliser demand.\nJPMC has mining rights over 1 billion tonnes of the country’s 1.5 billion tonnes of proven reserves of phosphate, according to company estimates.\nThe company has in the last two years embarked on a major restructuring plan to reduce 440 million dinars of debts and cut costs. Its losses were cut in half last year from 90 million to 46.6 million dinars. ($1=7090 dinars) (Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi.
