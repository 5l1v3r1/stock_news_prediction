The company extracts full spectrum CBD. Along with the acquisition, Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions also acquired SpeedyVeg ( speedyveg.com ), a proprietary, organic soil nutrient with specific benefit to growing healthy plants and maximizing yield.\n“We weren’t initially anticipating entering this space,” said Jeremy Roberts, CEO of Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions. “But after careful consideration, the opportunity to expand our footprint in the state-sanctioned cannabis space was too good of an opportunity for our shareholders to pass up.”\n“We are excited to come into the Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions family,” said David Schenk, SpeedyGrow’s President. “We have had a remarkable experience working with Jeremy and his team. We believe the future is bright for our combined company.”\n“We continue to focus on our core competency, which is providing best-in-class payment processing and banking services,” said Mr. Roberts. “This acquisition is yet another revenue stream for our investors.”\nAbout Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions: Our mission is to provide end-to-end management, across multiple management systems, for medicinal marijuana operations.
