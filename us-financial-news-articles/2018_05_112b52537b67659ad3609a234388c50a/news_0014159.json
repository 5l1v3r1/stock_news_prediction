Last year it used its golden powers to ensure it had a say in some strategic decisions at the former phone monopolist.\nThe spokesman said Elliott had won the vote on Friday because of support from state lender CDP, which holds a stake in TIM.\n“It’s not a market-driven victory because it’s a government owned agency which tilted the vote in favour of an American hedge fund instead of a long term industrial shareholder,” he said.
