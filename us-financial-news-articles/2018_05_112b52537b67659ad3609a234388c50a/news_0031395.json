A box of corn flakes made by Kellogg is seen on a shopping cart inside a local shop in Caracas, Venezuela May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\nAt a campaign rally ahead of Sunday’s presidential election, which Maduro is expected to win, the president called Kellogg’s move illegal and told cheering supporters that Venezuelans’ favorite cereal would continue to be produced.\n“We’ve begun judicial proceedings against the business leaders of Kellogg’s because their exit is unconstitutional,” Maduro said.\n“I’ve taken the decision to deliver the company to the workers in order that they can continue producing for the people.”\nKellogg announced its retreat earlier on Tuesday, making it the latest multinational to exit the oil-rich country, which is heaving under hyperinflation and strict price controls.

The current economic and social deterioration in the country has now prompted the company to discontinue operations,” Kellogg said in a statement.\nKellogg did not specify the difficulties it was facing in Venezuela, but companies have typically been struggling to find raw materials due to product shortages and currency controls that crimp imports.\nKellogg did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Maduro’s plans to hand its local unit over to workers.\nThe company in its statement warned against sales of its products or brands in Venezuela “without the expressed authorization of the Kellogg Company,” adding that it would like to return to Venezuela in the future.\nMaduro’s government also stops companies from raising prices to keep up with hyperinflation, denting profits and sometimes rendering operations unsustainable.\nThe closure is not expected to significantly worsen food shortages in Venezuela, but it was a further blow to morale for many Venezuelans as Kellogg’s is the most popular and available cereal in the country.\nStunned workers were barred from entering Kellogg’s plant in the central city of Maracay and massed outside, seeking information, local business sources said.\nOther multinational companies that have given up on the OPEC country, abandoning assets or selling them cheap, include Clorox ( CLX.N ), Kimberly-Clark ( KMB.N ), General Mills ( GIS.N ), General Motors ( GM.N ) and Harvest Natural Resources HNR.N.\nVenezuelans are struggling under quintuple-digit annual inflation and millions suffer food and medicine shortages. Even so, Maduro is expected to win re-election on Sunday in a vote the main opposition coalition says is a sham.\nMaduro blames Venezuela’s crisis on an “economic war” he says is waged by Washington, greedy businessmen and coup-mongers.
