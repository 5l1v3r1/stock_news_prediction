Mueller is probing Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia.\nBenczkowski’s nomination is one of many high-level Justice Department positions waiting to be confirmed by the full Senate.\nIn addition to the criminal division, Trump’s nominees to head the Justice Department’s civil rights, civil and environment and natural resources divisions await confirmation.\nU.S. Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado temporarily held many of them due to his concerns over the Justice Department’s marijuana policy.\nHowever, Democrats have also raised concerns about a number of the Justice Department nominees, complicating matters.\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in a speech in New York on Wednesday, lamented the delays and said Benczkowski and the other nominees have solid resumes.\n“Each nominee meets or exceeds the qualifications normally required for those important jobs,” he said.\nAlthough some lawyers on Mueller’s team are from the criminal division, Rosenstein - and not the head of the criminal division - oversees the special counsel’s probe.\nReporting by Sarah N.
