Right after the first incidents I told them it would be scary, they have no place there.\n“Then I told them at halftime - please, do something... We have come to watch basketball and we believe we have the right to stay up to the end.”\nLevski, who were leading 66-59 after 37 minutes, also condemned the ugly scenes but refused to accept responsibility for placing their hardcore fans close to the Balkan players.\nThe domestic league said the remaining three minutes would be played on Thursday behind closed doors.\nLevski have a history of fan violence at their football and basketball matches.\nIn 2014 the Adriatic League match between Levski and Serbia’s Partizan Belgrade was interrupted for almost an hour after the end of the first quarter due to fan violence.\nFights broke out in the Universiada Hall’s stands and then more than 100 supporters invaded the court, clashing with security staff and throwing seats, chairs and other objects.
