Net income was $31.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and net cash from operating activities was $74.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA was $38.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and net Adjusted EBITDA to the Partnership was $13.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. Distributable Cash Flow was $11.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, resulting in distribution coverage of 1.11x, which was greater than guidance for the first quarter of 1.10x. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n\"Oasis Midstream Partners started the year off strong, continuing to grow volumes in our respective DevCos, which allows for our continued support of strong coverage and keeps us on track to meet our targeted 20% annual distribution per unit growth,\" said Taylor Reid, Chief Executive Officer of OMP. \"OMP continues to grow volumes above and beyond our initial forecast, which will allow for higher distributable cash flow and higher distribution coverage over time. We have made significant progress on our new 200 MMscfpd gas plant in Wild Basin, which remains on time and on budget, and are looking at growing throughput volumes via higher Oasis Petroleum volumes and volumes from third parties. As wells get bigger and more rigs are returning to work, there is a lot of activity in the core of the Williston Basin, and OMP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. We are beginning to see incremental third party opportunities across all three of our DevCos, giving us further comfort in our projected distribution growth. We continue to expect fourth quarter 2018 coverage to exceed 1.2x and now expect the first quarter of 2019 coverage to exceed 1.3x.\"\nOther Key Developments:\nRealized improved natural gas processing volumes in Bighorn DevCo totaling 98.0 million standard cubic feet per day (\"MMscfpd\") during the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 40% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Increased natural gas volumes in Bobcat DevCo to 140.4 MMscfpd during the three months ended March 31, 2018, a 29% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting the early realization of improved growth opportunities identified during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to increased gas volumes in Wild Basin. Spent $35.4 million on Gas Plant II in Bighorn DevCo, with the project approximately 65% complete and on schedule to begin operations in late 2018. Spent $17.1 million on additional gathering system infrastructure in Bobcat DevCo to capitalize on additional growth opportunities identified due to increased natural gas volumes and incremental oil and water in Wild Basin in the first quarter of 2018. OMP anticipates natural gas volumes for Bobcat DevCo to grow to 137 - 142 MMscfpd in 2018 and for natural gas volumes to exceed 200 MMscfpd by mid 2019. Increased volumes in spite of a challenging North Dakota winter. OMP had higher operating expenses related to difficult winter conditions. In addition, OMP incurred incremental operating expenses related to equipment and facility upgrades during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to mitigate the impact of abnormally difficult conditions experienced both this year and potentially in the future.\nOperational and Financial Update\nSelect operational and financial statistics are in the following table:\nMarch 31, 2018\nOMP Ownership\nGross\nNet\nBighorn DevCo\n(In millions)\nOperating income\n100\n%\n$\n5.0\n$\n5.0\nDepreciation and amortization\n100\n%\n2.5\n2.5\nTotal CapEx\n100\n%\n42.2\n42.2\nBobcat DevCo\nOperating income\n10\n%\n$\n16.9\n$\n1.7\nDepreciation and amortization\n10\n%\n2.1\n0.2\nTotal CapEx\n10\n%\n27.8\n2.8\nBeartooth DevCo\nOperating income\n40\n%\n$\n10.6\n$\n4.2\nDepreciation and amortization\n40\n%\n1.7\n0.7\nTotal CapEx\n40\n%\n11.2\n4.5\nTotal OMP\nDevCo operating income\n$\n32.5\n$\n10.9\nPublic company expenses\n0.7\n0.7\nOMP operating income\n31.8\n10.2\nDepreciation and amortization\n6.3\n3.4\nEquity-based compensation expense\n0.1\n0.1\nTotal CapEx\n81.2\n49.5\nMaintenance CapEx\n2.3\n0.8\nGrowth CapEx\n78.9\n48.7\nMetric\n1Q18 Actual\n2Q18 Guidance\nFY18 Guidance\nBighorn DevCo\nCrude oil service volumes\nMbopd\n41.5\n40 - 42\n40 - 42\nNatural gas service volumes\nMMscfpd\n98.0\n98 - 103\n100 - 107\nBobcat DevCo\nCrude oil service volumes\nMbopd\n36.3\n33 - 36\n34 - 36\nNatural gas service volumes\nMMscfpd\n140.4\n135 - 140\n137 - 142\nWater service volumes\nMbowpd\n43.0\n43 - 47\n46 - 50\nBeartooth DevCo\nWater service volumes\nMbowpd\n108.4\n107 - 112\n107 - 112\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, OMP had cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million and $117.0 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility with an unused borrowing capacity of $83.0 million.\nQuarterly Distribution\nOn February 26, 2018, the Partnership paid the initial quarterly cash distribution to its unitholders of $0.0245 per unit related to the six days ended September 30, 2017 and $0.3750 per unit related to the three months ended December 31, 2017. The third quarter distribution was prorated from the closing of the Partnership's initial public offering on September 25, 2017. Both distributions equate to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3750 per unit on a full-quarter basis.\nOn May 7, 2018, the Board of Directors of OMP GP LLC, the general partner of the Partnership, declared the quarterly cash distribution of $0.3925 per unit for the first quarter of 2018. The first quarter distribution reflects a 4.7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017, or 20% annualized. The distribution will be payable on May 29, 2018 to unitholders of record as of May 17, 2018.\nQualified Notice\nThis release is intended to be a qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b).

We define Cash Interest as interest expense plus capitalized interest less amortization of deferred financing costs included in interest expense. Cash Interest is not a measure of interest expense as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash Interest provides useful additional information to investors and analysts for assessing the interest charges incurred on our debt, excluding non-cash amortization, and our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of interest expense, net of capitalized interest, to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash Interest for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In thousands)\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n$\n262\n$\n1,531\nCapitalized interest\n835\n289\nAmortization of deferred financing costs\n(116)\n—\nCash Interest\n$\n981\n$\n1,820\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Partnership's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense (net of capitalized interest), income taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation expenses and other similar non-cash adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors and analysts for assessing our results of operations, financial performance and our ability to generate cash from our business operations without regard to our financing methods or capital structure, coupled with our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively.\nDistributable Cash Flow (\"DCF\")\nDCF is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Partnership's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define DCF as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less Cash Interest and maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership. Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the construction or development of new capital assets or the replacement, improvement or expansion of existing capital assets) made to maintain, over the long term, system operating capacity, operating income or revenue. DCF should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of DCF provides information useful to investors and analysts for assessing our results of operations, financial performance and our ability to generate cash from our business operations without regard to our financing methods or capital structure, coupled with our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In thousands)\nNet income\n$\n31,529\n$\n12,249\nIncome tax expense\n—\n7,295\nDepreciation and amortization\n6,364\n3,458\nEquity-based compensation expense\n63\n348\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n262\n1,217\nAdjusted EBITDA\n38,218\n$\n24,567\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests\n24,496\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n13,722\nCash Interest attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n981\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n796\nDistributable Cash Flow attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n$\n11,945\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n74,751\n$\n20,379\nCurrent tax expense\n—\n5,358\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n262\n1,217\nChanges in working capital\n(36,681)\n(2,387)\nOther non-cash adjustments\n(114)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n38,218\n$\n24,567\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests\n24,496\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n13,722\nCash Interest attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n981\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n796\nDistributable Cash Flow attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n$\n11,945\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oasis-midstream-partners-lp-announces-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-earnings-and-distribution-300644040.html\nSOURCE Oasis Midstream Partners LP", "external_links": ["https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1777/25388", "http://www.oasismidstream.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oasis-midstream-partners-lp-announces-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-earnings-and-distribution-300644040.html"], "published": "2018-05-08T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:32:19.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
