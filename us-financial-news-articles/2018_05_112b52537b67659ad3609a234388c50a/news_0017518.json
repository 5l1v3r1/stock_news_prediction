The boards of both companies asked longtime CEO Bob Iger to stay on through the end of 2021.\nIf completed, Disney would get Fox's television and film studios, regional sports networks, cable channels National Geographic and FX. The entertainment giant would also grow its international presence through Asian pay-TV operator Star India and a stake in Sky TV. It would also get Fox's stake in Hulu. That plus its existing position would give Disney a controlling stake in the streaming service.\nOn Monday, CNBC reported that Comcast plans to make an all-cash bid for Fox if the Justice Department approves AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner . Comcast's offer would top Disney's and include a full acquisition of Sky, sources said.\nCNBC previously reported that fear of being outspent on content content was one of the main reasons Rupert Murdoch decided to sell those Fox assets. Tech giants like Netflix and Amazon have poured money into their streaming services, making the content bidding wars increasingly competitive.\nDisney's proposed acquisition of Fox assets would broaden the company's content portfolio, making it more competitive.\nFox is slated to report earnings after the market close on Wednesday.\nShares of Disney have fallen about 6 percent so far this year.\nThis is breaking news.
