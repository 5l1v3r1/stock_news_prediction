PRECEDENT\nThe dispute involved a number of leading international financial institutions, including fund manager BlackRock , an investor, and Deutsche Bank, which represented investors in legal proceedings.\nDana said the dispute had no implications for Islamic finance as a whole, but many in the industry worried that it could set a dangerous precedent for other firms to repudiate debts on the grounds that scholars’ interpretation of what was religiously permissible had shifted.\nThe original sukuk carried profit rates of 7 percent and 9 percent and used a mudaraba structure, an investment management partnership.\nDana argued this structure had fallen into disuse, and it justified paying a lower profit rate on the new sukuk on the grounds that its prospects had improved as it secured hundreds of millions of dollars of payments from Iraqi Kurdistan.\nThe new sukuk would use a wakala structure, a more common format in which one party manages assets on behalf of another.\nThe deal appeared fairly close to a proposal that Dana made to creditors in mid-2017, when it suggested swapping the original sukuk for new, non-convertible ones with four-year maturities and profit distributions at less than half the rate.\n“We are now pleased to have reached an agreement with the company and provide our support to the settlement,” the sukuk holders’ committee said without elaborating.\nOne sukuk holder, who declined to be named, was more critical.\n“The company has acted egregiously against their creditors in the interest of protecting the equity value. In doing so, they have anchored the conversation so far out in left field that any settlement is a win for them and a loss for us.”\nCreditors won some rounds in the dispute; a London High Court judge ruled in February that the purchase undertaking behind the sukuk was valid and enforceable.\nBut a court in the emirate of Sharjah at one stage directed enforcement of British court orders in the UAE be suspended, appearing to set courts in the two jurisdictions at odds with each other.
