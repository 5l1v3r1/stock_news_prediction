And what we have said is 3 percent,” Mignon told analysts during a call, speaking of CIB annual revenue growth targets for 2018-2020.\n“I’m pretty confident, and I think it’s a good start,” he added.\nNatixis shares were up 3.5 percent and on course for best day in three months after it reported a 15 percent rise in quarterly profits.\nRevenue at its corporate and investment bank was down 3 percent, weighed by a fall in equity trading revenue and historically high results a year ago.\nReporting by Maya Nikolaeva\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:13:15.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
