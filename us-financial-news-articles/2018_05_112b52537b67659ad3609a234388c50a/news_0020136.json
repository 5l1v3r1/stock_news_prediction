Three died and three more were wounded in the gun fight.\nThe ranch belonged to the family of Abel Montufar, the former mayor of Coyuca de Benitez, who was shot dead on Tuesday, the Guerrero state coordination office said in a statement. Montufar had left his post to run for state congress as a ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate.\nAt least 18 politicians have been killed in Guerrero since last September, state authorities say, with violence rising in the run-up to the July 1 presidential election.\nGuerrero has become one of Mexico’s top opium-growing regions, sparking violent turf battles between local gangs.\nIn a TV interview, Guerrero state security spokesman Roberto Alvarez said the rise in U.S. consumption of fentanyl, a powerful artificial opioid, had lowered local opium prices, forcing local gangs to diversify and seek new, often-violent forms of income.
