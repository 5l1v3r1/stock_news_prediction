STEADY DECLINE\nThe threadbare crowd and the twice champions’ free-fall under new coach Dan McKellar, an appointment promoted from within after Stephen Larkham stepped aside, will raise alarm bells at under-fire Rugby Australia.\n“Certainly our form is playing a part (with the crowds) and I’ve got to front up and take ownership of that 100 percent and I’ll never hide away from that,” McKellar said.\n“It’s if you start looking for quick fixes and blaming other people and looking for excuses, then it won’t (turn).”\nSince the Waratahs clinched the nation’s last title under Michael Cheika in 2014, Australia’s teams have steadily declined as their New Zealand rivals have only grown stronger.\nThe competition has turned off local fans, many of whom were enraged when Rugby Australia axed Perth-based Western Force last year after spurning an offer of a multi-million dollar donation from mining tycoon Andrew Forrest to prop up the team.\nBillionaire Forrest has spent part of his fortune setting up his World Series Rugby, bringing Asia-Pacific teams to Perth to play the Force in a series of matches featuring pre-match entertainment and rule modifications to speed up play.\nThe event has been dismissed by some media pundits as “gimmicky” but 19,000 turned up to the Force’s opening match against a Fijian side, comfortably outstripping the country’s biggest Super Rugby attendance this season.\nCrowd sizes will be under the microscope when the Wallabies host Ireland in June internationals, after disappointing turn-outs for the tests against Fiji, Scotland and Italy last year.\n“It’s really sad to be honest, as a rugby union person,” McKellar said in Canberra. “Everyone in this room and here tonight wants the game to be thriving. The reality is at the moment, it isn’t.” Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T12:11:11.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
