Mnuchin 2:30 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 02:03 Mnuchin emerged from the talks saying Washington and Beijing had put a potential trade war \"on hold,\" although top Trump administration officials have given few concrete details about a final trade pact. The world's two largest economies are holding talks as they try to avoid a potentially damaging escalation in tariffs.\nPresident Donald Trump has long pledged to crack down on alleged trade abuses by foreign countries, and he has consistently placed China at the top of his target list. But the administration appears to be separating steel and aluminum tariffs from other measures specific to China. Trump has specifically targeted alleged intellectual property theft by Chinese companies and China's massive trade surplus with the U.S.\nEarlier this year, the president imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports. The U.S. has temporarily exempted Canada, Mexico and the European Union as it tries to reach separate terms with those entities.\nWATCH: Mnuchin says we've made meaningful progress on China trade talks show chapters Secretary Mnuchin: We've made meaningful progress on China trade talks 8:45 AM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 17:31", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:58:17.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
