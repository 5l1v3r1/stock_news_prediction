Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Researchers have identified a new security flaw affecting nearly almost all modern processors. For those experiencing a sense déjà vu, the flaw is a variant of Spectre and Meltdown, chip flaws first announced in January that were found to exploit a technique used to speed chip processing.\nSimilar to Spectre and Meltdown , the Speculative Store Bypass or “Variant 4,” touches upon processors from Intel Corp ., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and ARM Holdings , targeting the same process, called speculative execution, where chips perform calculations out of order to speed performance.\nThe good-ish news . Researchers tell Reuters that risks are lower, because of the prevalence of patches created earlier to address Spectre. But because the patches address a flaw in how chips process data, fixes have resulted in performance sluggishness. Writes Wired : “Once companies push all the various types of updates, though, users will decide case by case whether to install them, since bypassing processing efficiencies to neuter potential attacks can also slow systems down… For SSB—which seems like it may be a less dangerous bug—some users may consider the pros and cons of patching rather than immediately moving forward.”\nWarren Buffett’s insurance company finds global benefits from the cloud. “We’re not going to stand up a technology platform that is unique to Asia and stand up a team in Asia,” Jamie Roser, CIO of Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance, tells CIO Journal’s Steven Norton . “We want to leverage platforms globally and figure out how to make them support the global needs.”\nPRIVACY + SECURITY\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the company’s annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, Calif., on May 1.
