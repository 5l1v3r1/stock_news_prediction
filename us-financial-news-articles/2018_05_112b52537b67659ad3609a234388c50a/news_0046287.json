While Qualcomm remains committed to the acquisition (the \"Acquisition\") of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (\"NXP\"), it is uncertain if the Acquisition will be consummated on or before June 1, 2018. The four series of outstanding notes are intended to finance the Acquisition and contain provisions that will require Qualcomm to redeem such notes if the Acquisition has not been consummated on or before June 1, 2018 or if the related purchase agreement is terminated beforehand. As a result, Qualcomm is offering to certain holders of such notes the opportunity to exchange those notes for four new series of notes that contain a provision requiring Qualcomm to redeem such new notes if the Acquisition has not been consummated on or before November 1, 2018 (instead of June 1, 2018).\nOnly holders who are \"qualified institutional buyers\" or who are non-U.S. persons (other than \"retail investors\" in the European Economic Area and investors in Canada who are not both \"accredited investors\" and \"permitted clients\") are eligible to participate in this transaction, as more fully described below. Concurrently with this transaction, Qualcomm also announced today the commencement of a transaction to repurchase such four series of notes pursuant to cash tender offers (each, a \"Cash Offer\" and collectively, the \"Cash Offers\"), which are open only to holders who are not eligible to participate in the exchange transaction.\nThe exchange transaction consists of four separate private offers to exchange (each, an \"Exchange Offer\" and collectively, the \"Exchange Offers\"), any and all of the outstanding notes listed in the table below (collectively, the \"Old Notes\"). Each of the Old Notes contains a special mandatory redemption (\"SMR\") provision which requires Qualcomm to redeem the Old Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption, if the Acceptance Time, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, dated October 27, 2016 (as amended, the \"Purchase Agreement\"), by and between Qualcomm River Holdings B.V., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm and NXP, has not occurred on or before 11:59 p.m., New York City time on June 1, 2018 (the \"SMR Date\") or if, prior to such date, the Purchase Agreement is terminated. Qualcomm is offering to exchange each of the four series of Old Notes for (i) four new series of Qualcomm's senior notes which will each have an SMR Date of November 1, 2018, which is five months after the SMR Date of the applicable series of Old Notes; and (ii) cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum dated May 21, 2018 (the \"Offering Memorandum\" and, together with the eligibility letter, the Canadian beneficial holder form and the notice of guaranteed delivery, the \"Exchange Offer Documents\"). No consents are being solicited as part of the Exchange Offers and no overall minimum condition exists for the Exchange Offers, although the Exchange Offer for the 2.100% Notes due 2020 may be subject to a minimum condition as set forth in the table below.\nIf the Acquisition is not completed on or prior to June 1, 2018, Qualcomm will redeem any Old Notes not exchanged in these Exchange Offers or tendered in the Cash Offers in accordance with the terms of the Old Notes, including, with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due 2019 (the \"Old 2019 Floating Rate Notes\") and the Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the \"Old 2020 Floating Rate Notes\", and together with the Old 2019 Floating Rate Notes, the \"Old Floating Rate Notes\"), pursuant to the applicable SMR provisions at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Old Floating Rate Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption, or as described in the immediately following paragraph.\nIn accordance with their terms, Qualcomm may redeem the 1.850% Notes due 2019 (the \"Old 2019 Fixed Rate Notes\") and the 2.100% Notes due 2020 (the \"Old 2020 Fixed Rate Notes\", and together with the \"Old 2019 Fixed Rate Notes\", the \"Old Fixed Rate Notes\") at any time under the \"make whole\" optional redemption provision. Assuming Qualcomm does not determine that all conditions to the closing of the Acquisition as set forth in the Purchase Agreement are reasonably likely to be satisfied or waived on or before June 1, 2018, Qualcomm intends to exercise, on or after May 31, 2018, Qualcomm's right to redeem the Old Fixed Rate Notes that are not accepted by Qualcomm in the Exchange Offers or in the Cash Offers under the \"make whole\" optional redemption provision. According to Qualcomm's current calculations, and subject to changes in interest rates that may occur after the date hereof, Qualcomm expects the redemption price under any such optional redemption to be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Old Fixed Rate Notes to be redeemed.\nThe Exchange Offers will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 25, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated by Qualcomm (the \"Exchange Offer Expiration Date\"). Tenders of Old Notes submitted in the Exchange Offers may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on May 25, 2018, subject to any extension by Qualcomm, but thereafter will be irrevocable, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law (as determined by Qualcomm). The \"Exchange Offer Settlement Date\" will be promptly following the Exchange Offer Expiration Date and is expected to be May 31, 2018.\nTotal\nConsideration (1)\nTitle of Series of Old\nNotes to\nbe Exchanged\nPrincipal\nAmount\nOutstanding\n(mm)\nCUSIP/\nISIN No.\nOld Notes\nMaturity\nDate\nOld Notes\nSMR\nDate\nNew Notes\nMaturity\nDate\nNew Notes\nSMR\nDate\nMinimum\nCondition\n(mm)\nNew\nNotes\n(principal\namount)\nCash\nFloating Rate Notes due 2019\n$ 750.00\n747525AN3; US747525AN39\nMay 20, 2019\nJune 1, 2018\nMay 21, 2019\nNovember 1, 2018\nN/A\n$ 1,000\n$ 2.50\nFloating Rate Notes due 2020\n$ 500.00\n747525AQ6; US747525AQ69\nMay 20, 2020\nJune 1, 2018\nMay 21, 2020\nNovember 1, 2018\nN/A\n$ 1,000\n$ 2.50\n1.850% Notes due 2019\n$ 1,250.00\n747525AM5; US747525AM55\nMay 20, 2019\nJune 1, 2018\nMay 21, 2019\nNovember 1, 2018\nN/A\n$ 1,000\n$ 2.50\n2.100% Notes due 2020\n$ 1,500.00\n747525AP8; US747525AP86\nMay 20, 2020\nJune 1, 2018\nMay 21, 2020\nNovember 1, 2018\n$300.0\n$ 1,000\n$ 2.50\n(1) Total Consideration per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and accepted for exchange, which includes a cash fee of $2.50 per $1,000 principal amount of such Old Notes.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Offer Documents, Exchange Offer Eligible Holders (as defined below) who (i) validly tender and who do not validly withdraw Old Notes at or prior to the Exchange Offer Expiration Date or (ii) deliver a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery and all other required documents at or prior to the Exchange Offer Expiration Date and tender their Old Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second business day after the applicable Exchange Offer Expiration Date pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, expected to be May 30, 2018, subject in each case to tendering the applicable minimum denominations, and whose Old Notes are accepted for exchange by Qualcomm, will receive the applicable Total Consideration specified in the table above.\nQualcomm will deliver New Notes in exchange for Old Notes accepted for exchange in the Exchange Offers and pay the cash consideration on the Exchange Offer Settlement Date. No accrued but unpaid interest will be paid on the Old Notes in connection with the Exchange Offers. However, interest on each New Note will accrue from and include the most recent interest payment date of the tendered Old Note.\nEach Exchange Offer is subject to certain conditions, including (i) that in the case of the Old 2020 Fixed Rate Notes, the aggregate principal amount of New Notes to be issued under the Exchange Offer for the Old 2020 Fixed Rate Notes must be equal to or greater than the minimum condition amount corresponding to such Exchange Offer set forth in the table above (the \"Minimum Condition\"), (ii) the timely satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions precedent to the completion of the Cash Offers for such series of Old Notes (with respect to each Cash Offer, the \"Cash Offer Completion Condition\") and (iii) that Qualcomm does not determine, in its reasonable discretion, prior to the Exchange Offer Expiration Date, that all conditions to the Acquisition as set forth in the Purchase Agreement are reasonably likely to be satisfied or waived on or before June 1, 2018. Qualcomm will terminate an Exchange Offer for a given series of Old Notes if it terminates the Cash Offer for such series of Old Notes, and Qualcomm will terminate the Cash Offer for a given series of Old Notes if it terminates the Exchange Offer for such series of Old Notes. The Cash Offer Completion Condition may not be waived by Qualcomm; however, Qualcomm reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive the other conditions.\nThe Exchange Offers are only made, the New Notes are only being offered and will only be issued, and copies of the Offering Memorandum will only be made available, to a holder of Old Notes who has certified its status as either (a) a \"qualified institutional buyer\" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") or (b) (i) a person who is not a \"U.S. person\" as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act, or a dealer or other professional fiduciary organized, incorporated or (if an individual) residing in the United States holding a discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) for the benefit or account of a non-\"U.S. person\", (ii) if located or resident in the European Economic Area, that they are persons other than \"retail investors\" (for these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (x) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \"MiFID II\"); or (y) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the \"Insurance Mediation Directive\"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (z) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the \"Prospectus Directive\")) and (iii) if located or resident in Canada, is located or resident in a province of Canada and is an \"accredited investor\" as such term is defined in National Instrument 45-106 – Prospectus Exemptions (\"NI 45-106\"), and, if resident in Ontario, section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and in each case, is also a \"permitted client\" as defined in National Instrument 31- 103 – Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations (\"Canadian Eligible Holders\"). Qualcomm refers to holders of Old Notes who certify to Qualcomm that they are eligible to participate in the Exchange Offers pursuant to at least one of the foregoing conditions as \"Exchange Offer Eligible Holders\".\nOnly Exchange Offer Eligible Holders who have confirmed they are Exchange Offer Eligible Holders via the eligibility letter are authorized to receive or review the Exchange Offer Documents or to participate in the Exchange Offers. For Canadian Eligible Holders, such participation is also conditioned upon the receipt of the Canadian beneficial holder form. There is no separate letter of transmittal in connection with the Offering Memorandum.\nThe New Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws.
