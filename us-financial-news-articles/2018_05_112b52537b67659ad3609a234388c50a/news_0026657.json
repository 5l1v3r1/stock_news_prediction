Now, he\nawaits the call home.\nHave a peaceful and happy Mother’s Day weekend On Point Fifty-nine black women: Here’s how we survived your leaky talent pipeline Three academic researchers interviewed 59 senior level black women executives from 2007-2014 to learn more about the barriers they were facing in corporate life. All were within four levels of CEO when the interviews began, and 51% were at the same level or higher when they concluded their research. This is a fascinating read, but one finding stands out immediately: The successful women excelled at navigating intersectional invisibility , or the tendency to be overlooked, undervalued, or ignored because of their association with two marginalized groups. Here’s the mantra when seeking out high profile assignments: “I’m the best choice for this job, and I’m probably not on your radar screen.” HBR Is 2018 the year of Indigenous women leaders? It’s starting to look that way. In the aftermath of Standing Rock, Indigenous activists have put their efforts toward supporting women candidates at all levels of government. If things break her way, Deb Haaland, Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico’s first district and a member of the Turquoise clan of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, could likely become the U.S.’s first-ever Native American woman in Congress. And she’s not the only woman breaking barriers. In other news , there is currently a record number of women leading First Nations in Manitoba – ten out of sixty-three chiefs in the province are now women. “It’s very exciting, but it is also, I think, a sign of change,” says the new Chief Deborah Smith of the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, near Winnipeg. The Nation Brand mascots are racially biased, too A new study by The Geena Davis Institute On Gender In Media and The Jel Sert Company called, “ Mascots Matter ” has found that there is a significant difference in how these brand representatives – everything from cartoon M&Ms to Mr. Clean – are depicted based on race and gender. And there are a lot of them – the survey identified some 1,096 products with mascots attached. Male mascots outnumber females two-to-one, and female mascots are more likely to be depicted as a limiting stereotype, and half as likely to be shown wielding any sort of authority. And only 2.9% of mascots are African American. “I was surprised how few mascots of color there are,” says Davis. “I’m used to seeing low numbers in any media, but only 2.9% of mascots were African-American. Wow, what are we doing? How does that happen?” Fast Company Cardinal Timothy Dolan is cool with Rihanna borrowing his miter The dazzling fashion from the star-studded Met Gala has raised a half-serious question about cultural appropriation. Does a Catholic-themed event count? While the debate rages on, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, head of New York’s Roman Catholic diocese weighed in with a wry joke on Sirius XM’s The Catholic Channel. Rihanna wore a bejeweled version of a miter, the traditional headwear worn by bishops and cardinals on formal occasions. “She gave it back to me this morning,” he said, implying that they’d conferred on fashion. Right? Dolan, who attended the event, said it was all fine. “I didn’t really see anything sacrilegious, I may have seen some things in poor taste, but I didn’t detect anybody out to offend the church.”", "external_links": ["https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9424-4", "https://hbr.org/2018/05/interviews-with-59-black-female-executives-explore-intersectional-invisibility-and-strategies-to-overcome-it", "https://www.fastcompany.com/40570318/yep-even-brand-mascots-are-guilty-of-gender-and-racial-bias?utm_source=postup&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Fast%20Company%20Daily&position=2&partner=newsletter&campaign_date=05102018", "https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/mascots-matter/", "https://www.thenation.com/article/the-first-native-american-congresswoman-in-us-history-could-be-elected-this-year/", "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/cultural-appropriation-met-gala-2018", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/record-number-female-chiefs-manitoba-1.4645382"], "published": "2018-05-11T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:58:44.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
