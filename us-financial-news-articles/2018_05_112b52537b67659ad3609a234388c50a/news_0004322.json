In one case, the beam caused minor eye injuries for two American service members piloting a C-130 turboprop. The incidents bolster longstanding U.S. concerns about China’s decision to establish its first overseas military outpost close to the largest U.S. military base in Africa. Neither the Chinese embassy in Washington nor China’s Defense Ministry responded to a request for comment.\nBottom Line The U.S. issued China a lengthy list of demands on trade for talks this week, from cutting the imbalance by $200 billion by the end of 2020 to halting government support for advanced technologies—requests Beijing called “unfair.” The wide-ranging demands, which also included slashing tariffs on imports of American products and a promise not to retaliate for U.S. penalties and trade restrictions, were contained in a document handed to Chinese officials ahead of the negotiations Thursday and Friday.\nTrump’s Gambit New comments by President Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani about a payment to Stormy Daniels place Mr. Trump at the center of questions about possible campaign-finance violations , two former Federal Election Commission leaders said. Election-law attorneys say the core legal question is unchanged: Was the October 2016 payment of $130,000 to the former porn actress related primarily to the election or to reputational issues that would have arisen even if Mr. Trump hadn’t been a candidate? The president and Mr. Giuliani hatched the high-risk plan to disclose on live television that he had reimbursed his longtime attorney for the payment, leaving the rest of his legal team stunned. Here’s a timeline of the significant developments since the Journal broke the news of the payment in January.\nStaying Put Xerox said an agreement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason has expired, meaning its existing board and management will remain in place . The settlement struck Tuesday called for CEO Jeff Jacobson to resign and the board to be overhauled. Messrs. Icahn and Deason said they and the current board couldn’t agree on certain unspecified measures for the board’s legal protection, but called on the company to carry out the agreed-upon steps. The developments raise questions about Xerox’s deal with Fujifilm, a complex transaction that the two investors had been seeking to kill, saying it undervalues Xerox. A judge last week temporarily blocked the deal, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit.\nProfit Gains The largest U.S. companies found a new formula for success in the first quarter: larger pretax profits and smaller tax bills—mostly compliments of the cut in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. More than half of the combined net income reported by 200 large public companies in the first quarter stemmed from a decline in their effective tax rates, a Journal analysis of quarterly financial data from Calcbench found. Through Wednesday, first-quarter after-tax earnings for S&P 500 index companies were on track to come in 25% higher than a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters. That would mark the seventh straight quarter of per-share profit growth and the strongest gains in more than seven years.\nNew From WSJ.

Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Jessica Menton\nReader Response Responding to yesterday’s question on the trade talks between the U.S. and China , Richard Mowris of Illinois weighed in: “A China treaty or a Japanese-like ‘deal’ that brought the transplants to the U.S. is a good start. However, the reshoring and rebirth of manufacturing will require bipartisan national-policy legislation focusing on our future technologies.” Scott Patten of Quote: : “Protectionist policies provided by the World Trade Organization for developing nations should no longer apply to China, the world’s second-largest economy. Europe, Japan, Korea and other developed nations need to side with the U.S. and Canada to force China to open its markets. If they do not, there need to be consequences/disincentives.” And David Soler of New Jersey shared: “The U.S. needs to lead a united Western bloc, all of whom have the same complaints about Chinese trade practices—state-subsidized industries creating global oversupply and forced partnerships requiring technology transfers.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories.
