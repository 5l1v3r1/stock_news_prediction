Tamayo would then chew up the papers on which tips were written, prosecutors said.\nMetro pleaded guilty in November 2015. Eydelman and Tamayo also pleaded guilty and were sentenced to three years and one year in prison, respectively.\nLawyers for Metro had no immediate comment on the sentencing by U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp in Trenton, New Jersey. Shipp had imposed the original 46-month term.\nMetro has been held in a federal detention center in Philadelphia, prison records show. He also faces three years of supervised release.
