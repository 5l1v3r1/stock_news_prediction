A larger site will be found later when the rest of the embassy relocates from Tel Aviv.\n“We are so excited,” said Friedman, a Trump appointee who was a strong advocate of the embassy move. “We have the official seal of the United States Embassy. We have the dedication plaque. They are covered right now, but on Monday they are going to be unveiled.”\nPraising Trump’s December decisions to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the U.S. Embassy to the city, Friedman signed off in Hebrew and English with the words “This year in Jerusalem.”\nTrump says his Jerusalem decisions, which break with decades of American policy, make good on U.S. legislation and presidential pledges dating back decades.\nThey were greeted with delight by Israel’s government, which said it recognises the “reality” of the Jewish people’s historic connection to the city.\nBut it infuriated Palestinians, whose president, Mahmoud Abbas, called it a “slap in the face” and said Washington could no longer be regarded as an honest broker in any peace talks with Israel.\nSeparately, Germany has advised its citizens to stay away from Jerusalem’s Old Town this weekend, citing the possibility of violence surrounding the opening of the Embassy on May 14.\nReporting by Stephen Farrell; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:14:09.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
