I think these efforts from Abe have not managed to create any progress yet. There's little reason to think that anything will change with subsequent meetings,\" James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Japan, told CNBC's \"Street Signs\" on Monday.\nTerritorial disputes over the South Kuril Islands have long been a source of contention between Japan and Russia. Since Soviet forces occupied the islands in 1945, the two countries have not signed a peace treaty .\n\"The problem is that the Japanese side wants territorial concessions and their deals are always very difficult because, quintessentially, territorial issues are a zero-sum game.\"\nDespite the conflict, Japan has in recent years attempted to strengthen political and economic relations with Russia. But such efforts are quickly losing momentum as Russia faces increasing international isolation due to multiple factors.\nPerhaps a more promising opportunity for the two countries to find common ground lies in the ongoing efforts to denuclearize North Korea. In fact, both countries are on the outside of discussions about the proposed summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Because of that, potential decisions reached at the meeting could leave out Russian and Japanese interests, Brown said.\n\"With the increase in diplomatic activity on the Peninsula, there are some increased commonalities between Japan and Russia and the reason for this is, I think, that the both of them feel a bit left out,\" Brown said.
