Some have banned partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of industrially-produced trans fats, the WHO said.\n\"Trans-fat is an unnecessary toxic chemical that kills, and there's no reason people around the world should continue to be exposed,\" said Tom Frieden, a former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control who now leads the Resolve health initiative.\nEarlier this month WHO issued its first draft recommendations on trans fats since 2002, saying adults and children should consume a maximum of one percent of their daily calories in the form of trans fats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:35:30.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
