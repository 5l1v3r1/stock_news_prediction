In total, family members, who are descents of founder John W. Nordstrom, own about 30 percent of the company.\nMeanwhile, Nordstrom is experimenting with new concepts to win back shoppers. It opened a store in Los Angeles that doesn't have any inventory. It's being staffed by personal stylists who can order merchandise for customers. It just opened its first Manhattan store — a men's clothing store — that has services like same-day delivery for a $20 fee and self-service kiosks for returns.\nThe department store chain earned $87 million, or 51 cents per share, on revenue of $3.56 billion.\nThat beat the average Street estimate for earnings per share of 42 cents on revenue of $3.47 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.\nIn its full-price division, which consists of Nordstrom U.S. full-scale stores, Nordstrom.com , Trunk Club, revenue at stores comparable sales rose 0.7 percent. The top-ranking merchandise was children's and men's clothing.\nIn the off-price sector, which consists of Nordstrom U.S. Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook and Last Chance clearance stores comparable sales increased 0.4 percent.\nNordstrom expects full-year earnings to be $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with revenue in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion.\nAnalysts were expecting profits of $3.43 per share and revenue of $15.7 billion for the year, according to FactSet.\nIn after-hours extended trading, Nordstrom shares slid nearly $3.61 to $47.30 following the earnings report.\nElements of this story were generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
