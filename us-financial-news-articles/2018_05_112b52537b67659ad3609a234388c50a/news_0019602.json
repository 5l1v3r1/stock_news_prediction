Trump expressed a preference for either of Blankenship’s top rivals, U.S. Representative Evan Jenkins or state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.\n“Remember Alabama,” Trump warned voters, recalling the Democratic victory in a special Senate election last year in the deeply conservative state after Republicans nominated Roy Moore, accused of sexual harassment and assault of teenage girls when he was in his 30s.\nBlankenship has attacked Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, accusing him of undermining Trump, creating jobs for “China people” and running TV ads highlighting the Taiwanese heritage of McConnell’s wife, drawing widespread condemnation.\n“I will say, all the media attention isn’t hurting him at all,” Patrick Hickey, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said of Blankenship. “There is a real sense here that career politicians are only out for themselves.”\nIn Indiana, the top three Republican contenders to challenge Donnelly have also sharply criticized one another while praising Trump. U.S. Representatives Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, longtime rivals, and self-funding businessman Mike Braun, have traded personal insults.

U.S. Representative Jim Renacci won Trump’s endorsement and is considered the favorite for the Republican Senate nomination over Cleveland-area investment banker Michael Gibbons.\nGibbons filed a defamation lawsuit against Renacci, alleging his campaign falsely claimed Gibbons was anti-Trump.\nDemocrats also have a competitive primary to succeed Republican Governor John Kasich. Richard Cordray, the former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is facing Dennis Kucinich, the former Cleveland mayor, member of Congress and presidential candidate, in a battle of liberal favorites.\nCordray has received the endorsement of liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren, while Kucinich has the backing of key allies of 2016 Democratic presidential contender Senator Bernie Sanders.
