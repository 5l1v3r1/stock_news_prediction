(NYSE: XRM):\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nQ1 2018 net sales of $126.1 million compared to $119.9 million in 2017, an increase of 5.2% (see Table 1). Q1 2018 operating income of $16.1 million, compared to $14.6 million in 2017, an increase of 9.9%. Q1 2018 net income of $2.2 million compared to Q1 2017 net loss of $(2.8) million. Q1 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $25.4 million, compared to $26.6 million in 2017 (see Table 2 and Table 3 and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below). Q1 2018 GAAP operating cash flow of $(12.2) million, net capital expenditures of $(2.4) million and free cash flow of $(14.6) million (see Table 4 and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below).\nXerium Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: XRM), a leading global provider of industrial consumable products and services, today reported first quarter 2018 results.\nMark Staton, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “We are pleased with our start to the year which reflects a stable market backdrop that was supported by our continued focus on execution. The quarter included some benefit from foreign currency on the top line and expected margin pressure compared to the prior year due to a significant difference in press felt production volumes that enhanced our margins in the prior year. Our underlying performance was modestly ahead of our expectations and stable with recent quarterly performance as we continue to focus on execution, cost control and debt reduction.”\nStaton continued, “As we look to the remainder of 2018, overall our end markets continue to show health and stability, and we are well positioned to build our cash position throughout the year and execute on our deleveraging plans.”\nQuarterly Consolidated Results\nQ1 net sales were $126.1 million, an increase of 5.2% year-over-year. The increase was largely the result of currency effects. Q1 2018 Rolls and Service sales increased 6.2%, to $50.3 million driven by favorable foreign currency impacts and improved volume in North America and Asia. Q1 Machine Clothing sales increased 4.5% to $75.8 million, which largely benefitted from favorable foreign currency impacts and improved volume in Asia and Europe. This benefit was partially offset by lower sales in North America, as Q1 2017 benefitted from the catchup of sales related to 2016 Machine Clothing production shortfalls. Backlogs of $181 million are flat to Q1 2017 and $13 million ahead of the backlog at December 31, 2017. Table 1 summarizes Q1 net sales and the effect of currency translation rates.\nQ1 2018 consolidated gross profit was $47.2 million, or 37.5% of net sales, compared to $47.6 million, or 39.7% of net sales in Q1 2017. Rolls and Service gross margin improved 50 basis points to 35.2% in Q1 2018 from 34.7% in Q1 2017. The increase was primarily due to cost reductions, net of inflation. Machine Clothing gross margin declined to 39.0% compared to the prior year period of 43.0% in Q1 2017. Gross margin was unfavorably impacted by 220 basis points in the current year related to production timing. First, 2016 production shortfalls required increased production levels resulting in favorable overhead absorption in early 2017. Second, planned inventory reductions in Q4 of 2017 drove unfavorable overhead absorption in Q1 2018. Additionally, there was negative product mix in the current year in Asia Pacific, partially offset by positive product mix in Europe. Overall, Q1 2018 gross margins are in line with internal expectations and the decline in Q1 year over year is due to timing. Machine Clothing 2018 gross margins are expected to be favorable in the second half of 2018 compared to the second half of 2017 and 2018 full year gross margins are expected to be in line with 2017 gross margins.\nSG&A expenses (including Selling, G&A and R&D expenses) were $30.3 million, or 24.1% of net sales in Q1 2018, versus $29.8 million, or 24.9% of net sales in Q1 2017. The decrease in the SG&A rate was primarily attributable to higher sales and savings achieved through the Company’s cost-out initiatives related to previously reported 2017 actions, net of inflation.\nGAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $16.1 million, or 12.7% of sales, an increase of 9.9% compared to Q1 2017 operating income of $14.6 million, or 12.2% of sales. Q1 2018 adjusted EBITDA declined to $25.4 million, or 20.1% of net sales, compared to $26.6 million, or 22.2% of net sales in 2017. In addition to interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA excludes expenses related to the Company’s restructuring activities, plant start-up costs, stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and certain non-recurring expenses. For a full reconciliation, refer to Table 3.\nQ1 2018 basic income per share was $0.14 versus Q1 2017 basic loss per share of $(0.18) as a result of higher sales, lower restructuring costs, forex gains and lower taxes, partially offset by lower gross margin percentages.\nCash taxes were $4.3 million in Q1 2018. Cash taxes are primarily impacted by income the Company earns in tax paying jurisdictions relative to income it earns in non-tax paying jurisdictions, primarily the United States. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) passed at the end of 2017 will be cash neutral to the Company in 2018. While the interest disallowance and other features of the Tax Act will put the company into a taxable position in the United States, existing NOL’s are expected to shelter the Company from an increase in cash taxes into the mid 2020’s.\nGAAP cash flow from operations was a $(12.2) million use of cash during the period, mostly reflecting the Company’s semi-annual interest payments due in Q1 and Q3. Q1 net capital expenditures were $(2.4) million, and free cash flow was $(14.6) million. Total debt at the end of Q1 was $518.6 million compared to $508.9 million at Q4 2017. Net debt at the end of Q1 2018 was $520.9 million, compared to $504.7 million at the end of Q4 2017. The Company’s net debt leverage ratio increased from 5.0 at the end of Q4 2017 to 5.3 at March 31, 2018 (see Table 5 for reconciliation). The Company’s cash flow generation will be weighted to the back half of the year due to timing of cash taxes, cash restructuring and changes in trade working capital. The Company expects 2018 free cash flow to be significantly better than 2017 free cash flow of $14 million, and plans to utilize its free cash flow to reduce debt.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company will discuss the current industry outlook, as well as company specific factors that will drive its expected 2018 results on its live conference call, which will be available for replay at www.xerium.com/investor-relations .\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company plans to hold a conference call on the following morning:\nDate: Monday, April 30, 2018 Start Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time Domestic Dial-In: +1-844-818-4921 International Dial-In: +1-484-880-4582 Conference ID: 3799615 Webcast: www.xerium.com/investor-relations\nTo participate on the call, please dial in at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start.

Management of the Company uses supplementary non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and adjusted EBITDA, internally to assist in evaluating its liquidity and financial and operational performance. Therefore, the Company believes these non-GAAP measures may also be useful to investors and financial analysts. EBITDA and free cash flow are specifically used in evaluating the ability to service indebtedness and to fund ongoing capital expenditures. Net debt presents a view of the overall change in leverage from quarter to quarter. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items the Company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business trends in order to better analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), net cash (used in) provided by operating activities or total debt.\nFor additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable financial measures under GAAP, please see the applicable tables within this press release. In addition, the information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the corresponding exhibits, financial statements and footnotes contained in our Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2018 and our presentation that will accompany our conference call this evening.\nNET SALES\nTable 1 summarizes Q1 2018 net sales and the effect of currency translation rates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Adjusted EBITDA, as defined and calculated below, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies.\nConsolidated net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that the following, without duplication, shall be excluded in determining consolidated net income (loss): (i) any net after-tax extraordinary or non-recurring gains, losses or expenses (less all fees and expenses relating thereto), (ii) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, (iii) any fees and expenses incurred during such period in connection with the issuance or repayment of indebtedness, any refinancing transaction or amendment or modification of any debt instrument, in each case and (iv) any cancellation of indebtedness income.
