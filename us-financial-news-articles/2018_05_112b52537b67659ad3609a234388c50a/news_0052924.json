So joint coordinated action to avoid oil spikes to ensure that there is sufficient market balancing definitely makes sense,” Dmitriev said.\nDmitriev helped design the current deal under which Russia and OPEC agreed to reduce supplies by 1.8 million barrels per day from 2017.\nOPEC meets in Vienna on June 22.\nReporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Katya Golubkova; editing by Maria Kiselyova\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:08:20.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
