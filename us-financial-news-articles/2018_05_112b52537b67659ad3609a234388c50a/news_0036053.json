(NASDAQ:ORIG), (“Ocean Rig” or the “Company”), an international contractor of offshore deepwater drilling services, today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Q u a r t e r 2018 Financial Hi g hlights\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported net income of $54.9 million, or $0.60 basic and diluted earnings per share.\nIncluded in the first quarter 2018 results are:\n-- Costs of $11.8 million, or $0.13 per share, associated with the Ocean Rig Mykonos and the Leiv Eiriksson shipyard stays, which are included in operating expenses.\nExcluding the above costs, the Company would have reported net income of $66.7 million, or $0.73 per share. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $111.0 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company’s rigs that are operating under drilling contracts achieved a revenue efficiency of 98.1% for the first quarter of 2018.\nRecent Events\nOn May 8, 2018, the Company prepaid in full the remaining outstanding balance (as of that date) of $43.8 million on its $462 million senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”), with no prepayment penalty. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was expected to mature in June 2018. Following the full prepayment of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the shares of the Company’s subsidiary, Drillship Alonissos Owners Inc., the rig owning subsidiary of the Ocean Rig Apollo, are in the process of being transferred back to the Company and the Ocean Rig Apollo is to be pledged under the Company’s $450 million credit agreement dated September 22, 2017, the outstanding balance on which currently stands at $350 million.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company, pursuant to the previously announced agreement, made the $35.0 million interim yard installment payment to Samsung Heavy Industries (“SHI”) in connection with the construction of the Ocean Rig Santorini. Under the agreement with SHI, the delivery of the Ocean Rig Santorini has been postponed to September 2019, but may be brought forward at the option of the Company. The Company’s drilling unit the Ocean Rig Corcovado , which is expected to complete its current drilling contract with Petrobras during May 2018, is planned to transit to Las Palmas, Spain, where it will remain in “ready-to-drill” state, and is expected to be actively marketed for employment.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure; please see the reconciliation to net income (the nearest GAAP measure) elsewhere in this press release.\nMr. Pankaj Khanna, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented:\n“We are pleased to report positive results for the Company. We believe our balance sheet is “best-in-class”, allowing us to prepay debt and fund future growth with no further maturities until 2024. We are working on several fronts to add backlog and get our three rigs that are in ready-to-drill state operating.\n“Oil prices have now topped $75 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and the fundamentals remain in positive territory. We are experiencing continued improvement in the level of enquiry we see from our customers. Brazil in particular is expected to make a comeback with rising rig demand from both Petrobras and International Oil Companies operating in the country. There are several other areas that are also showing improvement. We remain cautiously optimistic about the near to medium term recovery in the deep and ultra deepwater drilling markets.”\nF i n a n c i al R e v i e w : 2018 First Q u a r ter\nThe Company recorded net income of $54.9 million, or $0.60 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a net income of $92.2 million, or $10,300.45 basic and diluted earnings per share (1) , for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nRevenues decreased by $108.7 million to $194.1 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $302.8 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nDrilling units’ operating expenses increased to $76.2 million (including $11.8 million of shipyard stay costs, associated with the Ocean Rig Mykonos and the Leiv Eiriksson ) and total depreciation and amortization decreased to $26.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, from $75.6 million and $31.3 million, respectively, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.
