In accordance with the indenture on the notes maturing in 2027 and 2029, leaseback transactions are considered asset sales and proceeds equal to the net present value of the attributable debt is required to be repurchased in publicly traded bonds within 90 days of entering into the lease. On May 15, 2018, consent from a majority of the holders of the unsecured notes maturing 2027 and 2029 was received allowing the company to omit the requirement to repurchase publicly traded bonds in accordance with the indenture on the notes maturing in 2027 and 2029.\nElaine Lintecum, McClatchy's chief financial officer, said, \"These 9.0% Notes continue to trade at a premium and similar to our offers last year, we are not surprised that a majority of the holders declined our offer.\"\nAbout McClatchy\nMcClatchy operates 30 media companies in 14 states, providing each of its communities with strong independent local journalism in the public interest and advertising services in a wide array of digital and print formats.
