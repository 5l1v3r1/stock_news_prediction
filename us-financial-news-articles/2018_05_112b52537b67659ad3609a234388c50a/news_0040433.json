Underlying revenue, after adjusting for the strong euro, was up 2.6 percent.\nRTL, controlled by German publishing group Bertelsmann , said earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITA) fell 1.9 percent to 259 million euros, below analyst expectations of 268 million.\nReported earnings per share fell more sharply, to 0.72 euros from 0.89 euros a year earlier, compared with consensus expectations for 0.91 euros.
