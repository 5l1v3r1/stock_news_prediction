Palestinians are refusing to meet with representatives of the Trump administration and say they no longer recognize the U.S. as the main broker of peace talks with Israel. ‘The peace process is most decidedly not dead. We’re hard at work on it. We hope we can achieve a successful outcome there as well.’ —Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on “Fox News Sunday”\nU.S. officials this weekend said they would press on with their still-secret plan to secure what Trump has called “the ultimate deal” for Middle East peace. The plan is mostly finished, they said, and the administration is seeking the right time and place to present it.\nU.S. officials have said recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital reflects the reality on the ground. Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, and much of its government is in Jerusalem. The international community doesn’t recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. A peace deal has eluded Trump’s three most recent predecessors as president, and the most recent round of talks collapsed in 2014. ‘I think recognizing reality always enhances the chances for peace.’ —John Bolton speaking about the embassy on ABC’s “This Week”\nThe U.S. Embassy opening on Monday culminates nearly six months of preparations. The State Department spent about $400,000 to retrofit a consular building in Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood, straddling West Jerusalem and what is called No Man’s Land, a contested area that lies in between the 1949 armistice lines. Ahead of the opening, new road signs for the embassy appeared near the site.
