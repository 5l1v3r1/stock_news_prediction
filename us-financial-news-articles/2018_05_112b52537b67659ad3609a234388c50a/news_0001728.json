ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nTotal first quarter revenue of $54.8 million, up 23 percent year-over-year, and up 6 percent from the previous quarter\nQ2 Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:QTWO), a leading provider of secure, experience-driven digital banking solutions, today announced results for its first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nPlease note these results reflect the impact from the adoption of ASC 606, Contracts with Customers, effective Jan. 1, 2018.\nRevenue $54.8 million, up 23 percent year-over-year and up 6 percent from the previous quarter. GAAP gross margin 50.8 percent, up from 48.9 percent one year ago. Non-GAAP gross margin 54.3 percent, up from 52.5 percent one year ago. GAAP net loss $6.0 million, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $7.0 million 2017, and $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA positive $5.0 million, an improvement from positive $1.1 million one year ago and positive $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“We had a strong start to 2018, sustaining our bookings momentum in what is typically a seasonally slower quarter,” said Matt Flake, CEO of Q2. “Having just wrapped up our annual client conference, I believe our customers are generally optimistic about their improving operating environments. When you combine this with three consecutive quarters of positive bookings momentum, I believe we are well positioned for solid growth in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights .\nSigned a Top 50 credit union and two Tier 1 banks in the first quarter, including a $10 billion bank in the Southeast and a $7 billion bank in the West. Exited the first quarter with approximately 10.9 million registered users on the Q2 platform, representing 22 percent year-over-year growth and up 5 percent sequentially. Continued Q2 Open momentum, signing MoneyLion, a savings and investment platform with two million customers.\nFinancial Outlook\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for its second quarter 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue of $57.9 million to $58.5 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 22 percent to 23 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of $4.7 million to $5.3 million. GAAP net loss is the most comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes things such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, interest, income taxes and unoccupied lease charges. Q2 Holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Q2 Holdings has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for the full-year 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue of $236.5 million to $238.5 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 22 percent to 23 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of $21 million to $23 million. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes things such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, interest, income taxes and unoccupied lease charges. Q2 Holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort.

We are driven by a mission to build stronger communities by strengthening their financial institutions.

We help clients elevate the experience, drive efficiency and grow faster. To learn more about Q2, visit www.q2ebanking.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nQ2 uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP gross profit; non-GAAP sales and marketing expense; non-GAAP research and development expense; non-GAAP general and administrative expense; non-GAAP operating loss; and, non-GAAP net loss. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of operating performance because they exclude items that Q2 does not consider indicative of its core performance.\nIn the case of adjusted EBITDA, Q2 adjusts net loss for such things as interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, amortization of technology and intangibles, and unoccupied lease charges. In the case of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit, Q2 adjusts gross profit and gross margin for stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired technology. In the case of non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, and non-GAAP general and administrative expense, Q2 adjusts the corresponding GAAP expense to exclude stock-based compensation. In the case of non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss, Q2 adjusts operating loss and net loss, respectively, for stock-based compensation, acquisition related-costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangibles, and unoccupied lease charges.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, the closest GAAP measures, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the closest GAAP measures of these non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nQ2’s management uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance; to prepare Q2’s annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of Q2’s business; to evaluate the effectiveness of Q2’s business strategies; to provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance; to facilitate a comparison of Q2’s results with those of other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and in communication with our board of directors concerning Q2’s financial performance.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains , including statements about positive sales and bookings momentum, increased activity in the bank market and the effects of the improved economic environment on banks’ decision-making, optimism about our pipeline and Q2’s performance in 2018, and Q2’s quarterly and annual financial guidance.
