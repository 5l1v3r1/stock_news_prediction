Police unions have asked for more resources to fight the illegal trade.\nResidents, local politicians and police representatives gathered in the town holding a large banner reading ‘For your safety, for the safety of everyone’.\nPolice have made huge drugs seizures in recent months in Algeciras, the Mediterranean’s largest port and a trans-shipment hub used by firms to unload cargo for redistribution in Europe or the Middle East.\nNearly 9 tonnes of cocaine was found hidden among boxes of bananas in April in what the customs office said was the largest ever stash found in a single shipping container in Europe.
