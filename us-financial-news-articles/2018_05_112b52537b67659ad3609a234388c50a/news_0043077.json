The company said in February its top management, including chairman and executive directors, would be interviewed by the SFO.\nPetrofac shares, which have fallen more than 23 percent since the SFO investigation was disclosed, rose as much as 1.7 percent in early trading.\nReporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:13:43.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
