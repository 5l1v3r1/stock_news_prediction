That would be a very risky business,” Kazimir tweeted.\n“Should they decide otherwise and go on a ‘suicide mission’ and jump ship instead, so be it ... but let me be clear, you’re not alone on board of that ship!” (Reporting By Jan Strupczewski Editing by Alastair Macdonald)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:21:05.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
