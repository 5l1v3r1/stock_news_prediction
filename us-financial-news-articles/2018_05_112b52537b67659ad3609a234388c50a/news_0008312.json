The clear long-term benefit of Rowan's partnership in ARO Drilling is supported by the pending addition of four incremental jack-ups to the ARO Drilling fleet, owned 100% by Rowan. Backlog additions for our ultra-harsh heavy duty units reflect the somewhat healthier dynamics within the North Sea region, which we believe will continue to lead the recovery in the shallow water. Lastly, we added backlog to one of our top-tier deepwater assets, and have increasing confidence that further backlog additions for our deepwater fleet should materialize as 2018 unfolds. Though the environment remains challenging, we continue to execute operationally, focus on financial discipline, and aggressively pursue contracting opportunities.\"\nRowan will conduct its earnings conference call on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to numerous risks, assumptions, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include oil and natural gas prices and the impact of the economic climate; changes in the offshore drilling market, including fluctuations in supply and demand; variable levels of drilling activity and expenditures in the energy industry; changes in day rates; ability to secure future drilling contracts; cancellation, early termination or renegotiation by our customers of drilling contracts; customer credit and risk of customer bankruptcy; risks associated with fixed cost drilling operations; unplanned downtime; risks related to our joint venture with Saudi Aramco, including the timing and amount of future distributions from the joint venture or contributions to the joint venture; cost overruns or delays in transportation of drilling units; cost overruns or delays in maintenance, repairs, or other rig projects; operating hazards and equipment failure; risks of collision and damage; casualty losses and limitations on insurance coverage; weather conditions in the Company's operating areas; increasing costs of compliance with regulations; changes in tax laws and interpretations by taxing authorities; hostilities, terrorism, and piracy; impairments; cyber incidents; the outcomes of disputes, including tax disputes and legal proceedings; and other risks disclosed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, in our earnings release and during our earnings calls we may reference company information that does not conform to GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that an analysis of this data is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the Company and allows investors to better evaluate the financial results of the Company. However, these measures should not be viewed as an alternative to or substitute for GAAP measures of performance, and these non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with previously published Company reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. Non-GAAP measures we may reference have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables entitled Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\nROWAN COMPANIES PLC\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(As adjusted)\nREVENUE\n$\n211.2\n$\n374.3\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES:\nDirect operating costs (excluding items below)\n157.4\n171.3\nDepreciation and amortization\n97.9\n99.1\nSelling, general and administrative\n25.6\n24.2\nLoss on disposals of property and equipment\n1.3\n3.4\nTotal costs and expenses\n282.2\n298.0\nEquity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiary\n(1.3)\n—\nINCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS\n(72.3)\n76.3\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE):\nInterest expense\n(38.5)\n(39.6)\nInterest income\n6.9\n2.0\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n(0.2)\nOther -
