It also expects a 317-322 million yuan net loss in the first quarter of 2018.\nIt blamed the “excessive expansion” of Optimum Nano, as well as slow collection of accounts receivables, a tighter funding chain and changes to China’s subsidy policy for the poor performance. China has said it will gradually phase out subsidies for the EV sector.\nIn March, Australian lithium producer Altura Mining said it was in talks with Shaanxi J&R about potentially being acquired by the Chinese firm, which already holds a 16.87 percent stake in Altura.\nBut on April 2, Shaanxi J&R said 13 of its and Optimum Nano’s bank accounts had been frozen by a Wuhan court and the company’s general manager Li Yao resigned this week.\nWei said Shaanxi J&R was talking to a syndicate of around 10 banks to extend the repayment deadline for its debt.\nOptimum Nano’s production struggles have resulted in “less demand for upstream lithium carbonate materials,” further weighing on the price of lithium carbonate, a battery-grade form of lithium, Argonaut Securities said in a note on Friday.\nLithium carbonate prices in China on Thursday fell to 139,500 yuan a tonne, according to data from Argus Media, the lowest since August.\n$1 = 6.3449 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Tom Daly; additional reporting by Andrew Galbraith in SHANGHAI; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Louise Heavnes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:23:16.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
