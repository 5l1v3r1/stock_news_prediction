(NYSE: AEO) today reported EPS of $0.22 for the quarter ended May 5, 2018, compared to $0.14 for the quarter ended April 29, 2017. Excluding restructuring charges of $0.01, the company’s adjusted EPS increased 44% to $0.23, compared to adjusted EPS of $0.16 last year.\nAdjusted amounts are based on Non-GAAP results, as presented in the accompanying GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal net revenue increased 8% to $823 million compared to $762 million last year. Consolidated comparable sales increased 9% over the comparable period ending May 6, 2017. By brand, American Eagle’s comparable sales increased 4% and Aerie’s comparable sales increased 38%. Gross profit increased 10% to $304 million from $278 million. The gross margin rate increased 50 basis points to 37.0% of revenue compared to 36.5% last year, reflecting rent leverage and a favorable markdown rate, partially offset by increased digital delivery expense. Selling, general and administrative expense of $210 million leveraged 10 basis points to 25.5% as a rate to revenue due to strong comparable sales. Higher store compensation and incentive expense drove the majority of the increase from $195 million last year. Depreciation expense increased 4% to $42 million from $40 million last year, leveraging 20 basis points to 5.1% as a rate to revenue. Operating income of $51 million, which includes $1.6 million of restructuring charges, compared to $37 million last year. Adjusted operating income increased 23% to $52 million from $42 million last year, leveraging 80 basis points to 6.4% as a rate to revenue. EPS of $0.22 increased 57% compared to EPS of $0.14 last year. Adjusted EPS of $0.23 increased 44% compared to adjusted EPS of $0.16 last year.\nJay Schottenstein, AEO’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “I'm very pleased to see our momentum continue. The first quarter marked our 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales, leading to an increased operating margin and earnings growth, which exceeded our expectations. American Eagle leveraged strong brand equity and its dominant jeans business to deliver comparable sales gains across brick and mortar stores and e-commerce. After starting a body positivity movement, Aerie is posting record growth rates and striking a real emotional connection with its expanding customer base. We are highly focused on our strategic plan, centered on expanding American Eagle, accelerating Aerie’s growth, elevating the customer experience and delivering strong financial returns.”\nRestructuring Charges\nIn the first quarter, the company incurred restructuring charges primarily related to corporate severance, totaling $1.6 million, or approximately $0.01 per share.\nInventory\nTotal ending inventories at cost increased 11% to $404 million, in line with the company’s expectations. The increase reflected the company’s clearance store strategy and the support of strong sales trends in American Eagle and Aerie. Looking forward, we expect second quarter ending inventory to be up in the high-single digits.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $47 million, with more than half related to store remodeling projects and new openings, and the balance to support the digital business, omni-channel tools and general corporate maintenance.\nShareholder Returns, Cash and Investments\nDuring the first quarter, the company returned $69 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 2.3 million shares for $45 million and paid dividends of $24 million. As a result of strong free cash flow, we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $310 million compared to $225 million last year.\nStore Information\nDuring the quarter, the company opened 4 American Eagle stores and closed 2, ending with 935 American Eagle stores, including 118 Aerie side-by-side locations. Additionally, the company opened 1 Aerie stand-alone store and closed 1, ending with 109 Aerie stand-alone stores. Internationally, the company ended the quarter with 217 licensed stores. For additional store information, see the accompanying table.\nSecond Quarter Outlook\nBased on an anticipated comparable sales increase in the mid-single digits, management expects second quarter 2018 EPS to be approximately $0.27 to $0.29. This guidance excludes potential asset impairment and restructuring charges. Last year’s second quarter reported EPS of $0.12 included approximately $0.07 per share of restructuring and related charges. Excluding these items, last year’s second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19. See the accompanying table for the GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation.\nConference Call and Supplemental Financial Information\nToday, management will host a conference call and real time webcast at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
