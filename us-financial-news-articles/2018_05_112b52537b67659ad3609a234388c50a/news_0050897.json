They have the option to increase this by C$42 million.\nIn addition, Nemaska has agreed to do a private placement of 80 million shares at C$1 each with an unnamed institutional investor. Nemaska’s shares closed at C$1.18 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday, down 9 Canadian cents.\nIn April, Nemaska said Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ) would invest in its shares. It has also done a stream financing and a bond offering.\nReporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:47:07.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
