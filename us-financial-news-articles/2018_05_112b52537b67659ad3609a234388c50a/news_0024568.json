(\"Uniti\" or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:UNIT) today announced its results for the first quarter 2018.\n“The acquisition of a fiber portfolio from CenturyLink, and our previously reported TPx transactions, demonstrate our momentum at Uniti Leasing. We are continuing to grow our portfolio of highly valuable fiber leased to anchor customers with predictable long-term economics and attractive lease-up potential. We expect Uniti Leasing will be an important contributor to our future growth as shared communication infrastructure becomes more widely accepted in our industry,” commented Kenny Gunderman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Gunderman continued, “We continue to expect a multi-year investment cycle for communication infrastructure as network densification for 5G technologies and architectures are deployed. Uniti Leasing, Uniti Fiber, and Uniti Towers will be significant beneficiaries of these industry dynamics. We continue to win contracts to deploy dark fiber and small cells for our wireless carrier customers, and we are excited about Uniti Tower’s growth potential as new towers are needed in the U.S. and Mexico.”\nQUARTERLY RESULTS\nConsolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $246.9 million. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million and $196.7 million, respectively, for the same period. Net loss attributable to common shares was $0.9 million for the period, and included $5.9 million of transaction and integration related costs, partially offset by a $3.9 million non-cash gain related to mark-to-market adjustments on our contingent consideration obligations. Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) attributable to common shares was $108.7 million, or $0.62 per diluted common share.\nUniti Fiber contributed $67 million of revenues and $29.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018. Uniti Fiber’s net success based capital expenditures during the quarter were $30.8 million, and maintenance capital expenditures were $1.5 million. At March 31, 2018, Uniti Fiber had over $1.3 billion of revenues under contract, a 9% increase over pro-forma year-ago levels.\nUniti Towers contributed $3.4 million of revenues and reported an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.5 million for the quarter. Uniti Tower’s total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $9.2 million, which included the closing on the acquisition of 15 NMS development towers, and the completion of construction of 28 towers. At quarter end, Uniti Towers had 710 towers in service and approximately 150 towers in varying stages of development.\nUniti Leasing had revenues of $172.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $172.4 million for the first quarter. The Consumer CLEC business had revenues of $3.8 million for the first quarter, achieving Adjusted EBITDA margins 24%.\nINVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS\nOn May 1, 2018, the Company closed on the first tranche of its previously announced sale-leaseback and fiber acquisition from U.S. TelePacific Holdings Corp. (“TPx”). At close, the Company acquired 6,000 fiber strand miles located in Nevada, Texas and Massachusetts, which will be leased back to TPx on a triple net basis. In addition, the Company acquired and will have exclusive use of 7,000 fiber strand miles located in Texas. Total consideration for the first tranche of assets was $25 million. The Company expects to close on the acquisition of the California assets in the third quarter of this year.\nOn May 10, 2018, the Company acquired from CenturyLink 30 long-haul intercity dark fiber routes totaling 11,000 route miles and 270,000 fiber strand miles across 25 states. This transaction was approved by the U.S. Department of Justice as a condition of the CenturyLink / Level 3 merger, and adds attractive, high demand assets to Uniti Leasing. In connection with this acquisition, the Company has executed an anchor tenant lease with a Fortune 100 company for 11% of the fiber strand miles. We anticipate closing other leases of fiber strand miles in the future, including potentially more later this year.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS\nAt quarter-end, the Company had approximately $57 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and $450 million of undrawn borrowing availability under its revolving credit agreement. The Company’s leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.9x based on Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDA.\nAs previously reported, on May 9, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per common share, payable on July 13, 2018 to stockholders of record on June 30, 2018.\nUPDATED FULL YEAR 2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Company’s current 2018 outlook remains unchanged from its prior guidance, except for the impact of the May 1, 2018 acquisition and sale-leaseback of the first tranche of assets from TPx, the expected third quarter closing of the remaining assets from TPx, the closing of the aforementioned CenturyLink transaction, the anchor tenant lease of certain routes acquired from CenturyLink, and some additional lease-up at Uniti Leasing. Our current outlook excludes any future acquisitions, capital market transactions, and transaction costs. Furthermore, our outlook is subject to adjustment based on the finalization of purchase price allocations related to acquisitions and other factors. Actual results could these\nThe Company’s consolidated outlook for 2018 is as follows (in millions):\nFull Year 2018\nRevenue $ 1,006.0 to $ 1,016.0 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 802.0 to 811.0 Interest expense (2) 320.0 to 320.0 Attributable to common shareholders: Net income 12.8 to 21.8 FFO (1) 382.2 to 391.2 AFFO (1) 448.0 to 457.0 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 176.2 to 176.2 (1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

While we believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure, we also believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income, as defined by GAAP, before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction and integration related costs, collectively “Transaction Related Costs”, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments, and other similar items. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated similar to defined terms in our material debt agreements used to determine compliance with specific financial covenants. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\nBecause the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires the recognition of depreciation expense except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition.\nThe Company defines AFFO, as FFO excluding (i) transaction and integration costs; (ii) certain non-cash revenues and expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt and equity discounts, amortization of deferred financing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, straight line revenues, non-cash income taxes, and the amortization of other non-cash revenues to the extent that cash has not been received, such as revenue associated with the amortization of tenant capital improvements; (iii) the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, additional costs incurred as a result of early repayment of debt, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments and similar items less maintenance capital expenditures. We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and analysts, and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating performance. In particular, we believe AFFO, by excluding certain revenue and expense items, can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and events, such as transaction and integration related costs. The Company uses FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, only as performance measures, and FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance.\nFurther, our computations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to that reported by other REITs or companies that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO differently than we do.\nINVESTOR AND MEDIA CONTACTS:\nMark A.
