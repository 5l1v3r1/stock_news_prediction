Reuters was unable to trace contact details for Zeng or a representative to seek comment.\nThe Communist Party has long kept a tight grasp on its history, bolstering its legitimacy with tales of heroes and martyrs who gave their lives to the party’s causes.\nDisputing party history and questioning the deeds of heroes have already landed some historians in court.\nReporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T09:34:12.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
