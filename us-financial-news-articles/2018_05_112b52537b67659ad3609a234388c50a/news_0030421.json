Whether we are talking about North Korea or the trade discussions with China ... I think investors are recognizing we are at the beginning of the beginning of this, so it’s not anything to make dramatic portfolio moves or any significant bets on,” Nixon said.\nU.S. Treasury yields were little changed with the 10-year yield hovering near a seven-year high.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 3.0853 percent, from 3.08 percent late on Tuesday.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.13 percent to 93.340 after rising to 93.632 during the session, its highest since mid December. The euro was down 0.27 percent to $1.1805.\nU.S. crude fell 0.25 percent to $71.13 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.71, up 0.36 percent on the day.\nAdditional reporting by Tommy Wilkes and Dhara Ranasinghe in London, Danilo Masoni in Milan Editing by Susan Thomas and Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:48:37.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
