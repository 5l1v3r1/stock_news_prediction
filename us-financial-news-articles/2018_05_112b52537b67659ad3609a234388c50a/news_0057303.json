He walked two and struck out seven. The 25-year-old was making his first big-league appearance this season, and his first start since 2016.\nJake Lamb’s sixth-inning sacrifice fly produced Arizona’s only run.\nYusmeiro Petit, Lou Trivino and closer Blake Treinen secured Montas’ win with three perfect innings of relief, combining for four strikeouts. Treinen was credited with his 12th save after retiring the side in order in the ninth.\nGreinke (3-4), who had never lost in Oakland, appeared to be cruising after Lucroy’s homer until he issued back-to-back walks to Olson and Chad Pinder with two outs in the sixth, with the game tied at 1-1.\nChapman then followed with his single to left field, giving Oakland the lead for good.\nLucroy’s home run was his first ever off Greinke, whom he caught 35 times while with the Brewers. He’d gone 8-for-12 with a double, triple and two walks in his previous 14 plate appearances since they went their separate ways.\nThe home run also was Lucroy’s first of the season.\nGreinke was pulled after six innings, having allowed both Oakland runs on six hits. He walked three and struck out five.\nChapman and Marcus Semien had two hits apiece for the A’s, who evened their record at 3-3 in their ongoing 10-game homestand. Oakland opens a four-game home set against Tampa Bay on Monday.\nThe A’s have won nine of their last 13 games. They out-hit the Diamondbacks 7-3.\nAll three hits for the Diamondbacks were singles as they continued an offensive slump that’s now seen them score two or fewer runs in 13 of their last 16 games.\nArizona has lost 15 of 17, including eight of nine on its just-completed trip. The Diamondbacks kick off a six-game homestand Monday against the Cincinnati Reds.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:32:04.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
