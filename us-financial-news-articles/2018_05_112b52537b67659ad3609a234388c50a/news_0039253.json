It was last at 3.0742 percent on Wednesday.\nThe latest report comes after markets took comfort from a recent string of data that pointed to softening inflation.\nReports on housing starts, industrial production and weekly jobless claims are all due later in the day.\nAt 7:19 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 17 points, or 0.07 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.09 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 9.25 points, or 0.13 percent.\nAmong stocks, Micron rose 1.6 percent in premarket trading after RBC Capital Markets began coverage with “outperform” while AMD gained 1.8 percent after a rating upgrade at Susquehanna.\nMacy’s rose 0.1 percent ahead of the retailer’s results.
