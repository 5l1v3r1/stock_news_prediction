Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group both soared 2.1 percent, while Dai-ichi Life Holdings surged 1.3 percent.\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit 3.10 percent on Wednesday for the first time since July 2011.\n“Investors are still worried about rising U.S. yields. But as long as the yield’s rise is gradual, the market is likely to withstand it,” said Masashi Oda, general manager of the strategic investment department at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.\nThe weaker yen supported big exporters such tech companies. Advantest Corp gained 1.8 percent, Kyocera Corp added 0.9 percent and Sumco advanced 2.0 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.3 percent to 1,806.29.
