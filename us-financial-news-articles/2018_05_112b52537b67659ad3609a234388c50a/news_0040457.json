The manager did not name the Blackstone funds involved in the sale.\nThe VXV portfolio includes seven low-rise office buildings, totalling about 88,000 square metres.\n“With an expected loan-to-value ratio of below 20 percent following this sale, we have substantial capacity for future development and investment opportunities,” said John Dakin, chief executive officer of GMT’s manager.\nDakin said that following the deal and other contracted sales, GMT’s NZ$2.2 billion portfolio will be almost fully invested in the industrial market of New Zealand’s largest urban area.\nWhile Blackstone has been active in the Australia-New Zealand region, the Goodman deal marks the latest move in the countries’ real estate space for the alternative investment firm’s largest fee-grossing line of business.\nAccording to sources, a Blackstone unit was the buyer when indebted Chinese conglomerate HNA Group announced the sale of a Sydney office building for A$205 million ($154.00 million) earlier this year.\nThe growth of Blackstone’s real estate business has been a factor in former real estate head and Blackstone lifer Jon Gray being named its chief operating officer and president in February.\nBeyond the real estate space, Australian automotive aftercare firm AMA Group sold its vehicle panel repair arm to funds advised by Blackstone in April for an enterprise value of A$508 million.
