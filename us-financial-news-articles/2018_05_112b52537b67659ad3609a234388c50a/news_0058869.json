A lawyer for Jiampietro was not immediately available for further comment.\nJiampietro’s case reflected difficulties that can arise when government employees move to the private sector but continue to communicate with their former employer.\nThe Fed accused Jiampietro of having in 2014 asked Goldman junior banker Rohit Bansal to obtain secrets from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Bansal once worked, for use in Goldman’s client advisory work and pitches to potential clients.\nBansal and Jason Gross, his source at the New York Fed, pleaded guilty in November 2015 to theft of government property. Both were sentenced to probation and received industry bans.\nThe administrative law judge, Christopher McNeil, concluded that Jiampietro breached duties he owed to Goldman by ignoring “red flags” and failing to determine the confidential nature of documents originating from the Fed.\nGoldman paid $86.3 million in penalties to the Fed and New York State’s Department of Financial Services in connection with the leaking. It fired Jiampietro and Bansal in 2014. Goldman, Bansal and Gross are not defendants in Wednesday’s lawsuit.\nThe case is Jiampietro v Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-04769.
