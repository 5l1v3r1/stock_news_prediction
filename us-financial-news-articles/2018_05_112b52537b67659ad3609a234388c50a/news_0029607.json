(NYSE: IRS; BYMA: IRSA), the leading real estate company in Argentina announces today its results for the third quarter of FY 2018 ended March 31, 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nAdjusted EBITDA for the nine-month period of FY 2018 was ARS 10,116 million (ARS 2,140 million from Argentina Business Center and ARS 7,976 million from Israel Business Center), increasing by 35.0% compared to the same period of 2017 (14% of increase in Argentina Business Center and 44% in Israel Business Center). Net result for the nine months' period of FY18 registered a gain of ARS 11,290 million compared to a gain of ARS 6,506 million in the same period of fiscal year 2017, mainly explained by a higher result due to a change in the fair value of investment properties due to the impact of the tax reform implemented in Argentina and for the effects of the exchange rate on them, offset by the loss recorded in our center of operations in Israel as a result of the partial debt swap made by Discount Corporation Ltd. (\"DIC\"). Tenant Sales in our malls grew by 24% during the nine-month period of FY2018 while the average rent of the office portfolio reached USD/sqm 26.9. Adjusted EBITDA of the rental segment increased by 19.1% in the compared period. We reached 98.6% occupancy in our shopping malls, 91.1% occupancy in our offices and 71.9% in our hotels' portfolio. In Israel Business Center, we have sold during the quarter and subsequently, an additional 10% of Clal Insurance through two swap transactions. The stake of IDBD in Clal reduced to 34.8% of its stock capital.\nFinancial Highlights\n(In millions of Argentine Pesos)\nIIIQ18 ended March 31, 2018\nIncome Statement\n03/31/2018\n03/31/2017 (adjusted)\nRevenues\n65,696\n55,201\nConsolidated Gross Profit\n20,932\n16,739\nNet result from changes in the fair value of investment properties\n12,796\n3,042\nConsolidated Profit from Operations\n18,691\n6,814\nProfit For the Period\n11,290\n6,506\nAttributable to:\nIRSA's Shareholders\n9,405\n3,784\nNon-Controlling interest\n1,885\n2,722\nEPS (Basic)\n16,36\n6,58\nEPS (Diluted)\n16,24\n6,54\nBalance Sheet\n03/31/2018\n06/30/2017\nCurrent Assets\n84,227\n65,492\nNon Current Assets\n195,530\n165,750\nTotal Assets\n279,757\n231,242\nCurrent Liabilities\n51,401\n46,434\nNon Current Liabilities\n169,305\n137,472\nTotal Liabilities\n220,706\n183,906\nNon-Controlling Interest\n28,400\n21,472\nShareholders' Equity\n59,051\n47,336\nIRSA Inversiones y Representaciones S.A.
