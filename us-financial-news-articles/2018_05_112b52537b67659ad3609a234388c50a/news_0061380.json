Consequently, the bearish sentiment is somewhat less prominent on Brent prices.\"\nThe Brent price has fallen nearly 7 percent since hitting $80.50 on May 17, its highest since 2014.\n\"High uncertainty clouds the short-term outlook and we maintain a neutral view. In the medium to longer term, we still see oil prices falling as indicated by the downward-sloping futures curve. Our 'low for longer' view is deferred, not refuted,\" Julius Baer's Norbert Ruecker said in a note.\nHedge funds and other money managers reduced their net long position in Brent and WTI by 169 million barrels over the five weeks to May 22. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2LBbW8l).\nThe decision to pare positions in crude points to deeper unease about the sustainability of the rally in oil prices over the last 10 months, said John Kemp, a Reuters market analyst.\nBrent now commands its largest premium over U.S. futures in more than three years, meaning U.S. exports are rapidly becoming far more competitive globally than those from northern Europe, Russia or parts of the Middle East.\nThe spread between Brent and U.S. crude <CL-LCO1=R> stands at nearly $9 a barrel, its widest since March 2015.\nU.S. oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has surged by more than 20 percent in the past two years to 10.73 million bpd. That puts the United States ahead of Saudi Arabia and within reach of top producer Russia, which pumps about 11 million bpd.\nRecord crude oil volumes from the United States are expected to head to Asia in the coming months, nibbling away the market share of OPEC and Russia.
