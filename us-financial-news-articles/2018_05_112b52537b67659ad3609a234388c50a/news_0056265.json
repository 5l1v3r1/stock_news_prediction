A ticket for the two-day conference on the southern Chinese island of Hainan cost up to 2,980 yuan ($466).\nChinese authorities have cracked down on the cryptocurrency business to try to limit risks as consumers pile into a highly speculative market that has grown rapidly.\nWhile Beijing has banned initial coin offerings, shut cryptocurrency trading exchanges and limited bitcoin mining, it has continued to flourish through alternative channels in China.\n“Blockchain is a fledgling business that warrants the attention and open attitude from the government, and we will not tolerate any scam behaviour that disrupts industry order in the name of blockchain,” said another user on WeChat.\nConference organisers apologised for the performance, co-organiser Bikuai said on its website.\n($1 = 6.3927 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo; Editing by Darren Schuettler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T14:46:59.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
