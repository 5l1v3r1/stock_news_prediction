(NYSE:RYN) today reported first quarter net income attributable to Rayonier of $40.5 million, or $0.31 per share, on revenues of $203.2 million. This compares to net income attributable to Rayonier of $33.8 million, or $0.27 per share, on revenues of $194.5 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year first quarter results included $0.7 million of costs related to shareholder litigation 1 and $28.2 million of income from a Large Disposition. 2 Excluding these items, pro forma net income 3 was $6.3 million, or $0.05 per share, on pro forma revenues 3 of $152.5 million in the prior year period.\nThe following table summarizes the current quarter and comparable prior year period results on an actual and pro forma basis:\nThree Months Ended (millions of dollars, except earnings per share (EPS)) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 $ EPS $ EPS Revenues $203.2 $194.5 Large Dispositions 2 — (42.0 ) Pro forma revenues 3 $203.2 $152.5 Net income attributable to Rayonier $40.5 $0.31 $33.8 $0.27 Costs related to shareholder litigation 1 — — 0.7 0.01 Large Dispositions 2 — — (28.2 ) (0.23 ) Pro forma net income 3 $40.5 $0.31 $6.3 $0.05 First quarter operating income was $57.1 million versus $49.3 million in the prior year period. Prior year first quarter operating income included $0.7 million of costs related to shareholder litigation 1 and $28.2 million of income from a Large Disposition. 2 Excluding these items, pro forma operating income 3 was $21.8 million in the prior year period. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 was $93.4 million versus $57.1 million in the prior year period.\nThe following table summarizes operating income (loss), pro forma operating income (loss) 3 and Adjusted EBITDA 3 for the current quarter and comparable prior year period:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Operating Income\n(Loss)\nPro forma\nOperating Income\n(Loss) 3\nAdjusted EBITDA 3 (millions of dollars) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Southern Timber $12.2 $13.9 $12.2 $13.9 $28.2 $26.4 Pacific Northwest Timber 4.7 (0.9 ) 4.7 (0.9 ) 14.2 9.3 New Zealand Timber 16.0 10.3 16.0 10.3 21.8 15.7 Real Estate 28.1 29.7 28.1 1.5 32.7 8.6 Trading 0.1 1.1 0.1 1.1 0.1 1.1 Corporate and other (4.0 ) (4.8 ) (4.0 ) (4.1 ) (3.7 ) (4.0 ) Total $57.1 $49.3 $57.1 $21.8 $93.4 $57.1 Cash provided by operating activities was $78.2 million versus $33.9 million in the prior year period. Cash available for distribution (CAD) 3 of $77.4 million increased $38.6 million versus the prior year period primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA 3 ($36.3 million), lower cash interest paid ($1.1 million) and lower capital expenditures ($1.2 million).\n“We are pleased with our strong start to 2018, as all three of our timber segments realized meaningful increases in Adjusted EBITDA relative to the prior year quarter,” said David Nunes, President and CEO. “Real Estate results, excluding the prior year gain on a Large Disposition, 2 were also significantly above the prior year quarter due to an increase in the number of acres sold and higher average pricing. Southern Timber volumes increased 14% relative to the prior year quarter, primarily due to mill outages during the prior year as well as incremental volume from acquisitions. Average stumpage prices in Southern Timber were relatively flat compared to the prior year quarter. In Pacific Northwest Timber, results improved significantly despite 5% lower volumes due to a 27% increase in delivered sawtimber prices relative to the prior year quarter, reflecting strong domestic and export market conditions. New Zealand Timber results also improved significantly versus the prior year quarter, driven by 12% higher harvest volumes and increases in export and domestic sawtimber prices of 8% and 11%, respectively.”\nSouthern Timber\nFirst quarter sales of $43.6 million increased $4.5 million, or 11%, versus the prior year period. Harvest volumes increased 14% to 1.57 million tons versus 1.38 million tons in the prior year period, primarily due to incremental volume from acquisitions coupled with stronger overall demand, as the prior year period was negatively impacted by mill outages. Average pine sawtimber stumpage prices were roughly flat at $26.31 per ton versus $26.42 per ton in the prior year period, while average pine pulpwood stumpage prices decreased 1% to $17.11 per ton versus $17.29 per ton in the prior year period. The modest variation in average sawtimber and pulpwood stumpage prices was driven primarily by geographic mix. Overall, weighted-average stumpage prices (including hardwood) were roughly flat at $20.32 per ton versus $20.40 per ton in the prior year period. Operating income of $12.2 million decreased $1.7 million versus the prior year period due to lower weighted-average stumpage prices ($0.1 million), higher depletion rates ($1.9 million), lower non-timber income ($1.3 million) and higher franchise taxes and other costs ($0.5 million), which were partially offset by higher volumes ($2.1 million).\nFirst quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $28.2 million was $1.8 million above the prior year period.\nPacific Northwest Timber\nFirst quarter sales of $31.4 million increased $5.5 million, or 21%, versus the prior year period. Harvest volumes decreased 5% to 379,000 tons versus 399,000 tons in the prior year period. Average delivered sawtimber prices increased 27% to $95.45 per ton versus $74.88 per ton in the prior year period, while average delivered pulpwood prices increased 15% to $44.52 per ton versus $38.71 per ton in the prior year period. The increase in average sawtimber prices was due to strong demand from both domestic and export markets. The increase in average pulpwood prices was due to increased competition for pulpwood as markets for export chips to Asia continue to develop. Operating income of $4.7 million increased $5.6 million relative to an operating loss of $0.9 million in the prior year period due to higher prices ($5.3 million), lower depletion rates ($0.2 million) and lower other costs ($0.4 million), which were partially offset by lower volumes ($0.1 million) and lower non-timber income ($0.2 million).\nFirst quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $14.2 million was $4.9 million above the prior year period.\nNew Zealand Timber\nFirst quarter sales of $53.0 million increased $12.2 million, or 30%, versus the prior year period. Harvest volumes increased 12% to 558,000 tons versus 500,000 tons in the prior year period, driven primarily by incremental volume from prior year acquisitions. Average delivered prices for export sawtimber increased 8% to $117.70 per ton versus $108.73 per ton in the prior year period, while average delivered prices for domestic sawtimber increased 11% to $87.02 per ton versus $78.45 per ton in the prior year period. The increase in export sawtimber prices was primarily due to stronger demand from China. The increase in domestic sawtimber prices (in U.S. dollar terms) was driven by increased demand tension between export markets and local sawmills as well as a modest rise in the NZ$/US$ exchange rate (US$0.72 per NZ$1.00 versus US$0.71 per NZ$1.00). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, domestic sawtimber prices increased 9% from the prior year period. Operating income of $16.0 million increased $5.7 million versus the prior year period due to higher prices ($2.8 million), higher volumes ($1.6 million), higher carbon sales ($2.0 million) and lower depletion rates ($0.3 million), which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts ($0.4 million), higher costs ($0.2 million) and the prior year receipt of a timber damage settlement ($0.4 million).\nFirst quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $21.8 million was $6.1 million above the prior year period.\nReal Estate\nFirst quarter sales of $36.1 million decreased $18.2 million versus the prior year period, while operating income of $28.1 million decreased $1.6 million versus the prior year period. The prior year first quarter sales and operating income included $42.0 million and $28.2 million, respectively, from a Large Disposition. 2 Excluding this item, pro forma sales 3 of $36.1 million increased $23.8 million versus the prior year period, while pro forma operating income 3 of $28.1 million increased $26.6 million versus the prior year period due to a higher number of acres sold (8,225 acres sold versus 6,207 acres sold in the prior year period) and an increase in weighted-average prices ($4,387 per acre versus $1,988 per acre in the prior year period).\nImproved Development closings of $1.1 million in the Wildlight development project included 2.1 acres of commercial property for $0.6 million ($283,000 per acre) and 9 residential lots for $0.5 million ($60,000 per lot or $278,000 per acre).\nUnimproved Development sales of $7.4 million consisted of a 494-acre tract in Nassau County, Florida for $10,000 per acre and a 131-acre tract in St. John’s County, Florida for $19,195 per acre.\nRural sales of $1.7 million were comprised of 415 acres at an average price of $3,977 per acre. This compares to prior year first quarter sales of $6.7 million, comprised of 2,284 acres at an average price of $2,950 per acre.\nNon-strategic / Timberland sales of $25.8 million were comprised of 7,181 acres at an average price of $3,599 per acre, including a sale of 6,965 acres in St. John’s County, Florida for $3,650 per acre. This compares to prior year first quarter sales of $5.6 million, comprised of 3,923 acres in Alabama at an average price of $1,427 per acre.\nFirst quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $32.7 million was $24.1 million above the prior year period.\nTrading\nFirst quarter sales of $39.2 million increased $4.9 million versus the prior year period due to higher volumes and prices. Sales volumes increased 6% to 341,000 tons versus 322,000 tons in the prior year period. Average prices increased 9% to $114.61 per ton versus $105.43 per ton in the prior year period primarily due to stronger demand from China. Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $0.1 million decreased $1.0 million versus the prior year period due to lower trading margins resulting from increased competition for log supply coupled with higher log yard and port costs due to port congestion and vessel timing.\nOther Items\nFirst quarter corporate and other operating expenses of $4.0 million decreased $0.8 million versus the prior year period due to lower costs related to shareholder litigation 1 ($0.7 million) and income from the sale of unused Internet Protocol addresses ($0.6 million), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($0.2 million) and a reduction in overhead costs allocated to operating segments ($0.3 million).\nFirst quarter interest expense of $8.1 million decreased $0.3 million versus the prior year period due to lower average debt.\nFirst quarter income tax expense of $6.9 million increased $0.6 million versus the prior year period due to improved results from the New Zealand JV, which is the primary driver of income tax expense.\nOutlook\n“Based on our strong start to 2018, we are on track to achieve our full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance,” added Nunes. “In our Southern Timber segment, we expect to achieve our full-year volume guidance, although we anticipate lower quarterly harvest volumes for the remainder of the year, as we experienced above average stumpage removals in the first quarter. We continue to expect that average pricing in our Southern Timber segment will remain relatively flat versus 2017 average prices, with quarter-to-quarter fluctuations driven primarily by geographic mix. In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we are similarly on track to achieve our full-year volume guidance with lower quarterly harvest volumes for the balance of the year, while we expect continued strong sawtimber pricing due to competing demand in domestic and export markets. In our New Zealand Timber segment, we expect a seasonal uptick in quarterly volumes for the balance of the year and remain on track to achieve our full-year volume guidance, while we expect continued strong performance driven by solid demand in both domestic and export markets. In our Real Estate segment, we expect strong results again in the second quarter based on the anticipated timing of closings with lighter activity during the second half of the year. We remain pleased with the pace at which our Wildlight development project is progressing and expect additional commercial and residential closings throughout the remainder of the year.”\nConference Call\nA conference call and live audio webcast will be held on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 10:00 AM EDT to discuss these results.\nAccess to the live audio webcast will be available at www.rayonier.com .

(b) Cash Available for Distribution (CAD) is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to measure cash generated during a period that is available for common stock dividends, distributions to the New Zealand minority shareholder, repurchase of the Company’s common shares, debt reduction, strategic acquisitions and real estate development investments. CAD is defined as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for capital spending (excluding timberland acquisitions and spending on the Rayonier office building) and working capital and other balance sheet changes. CAD is not necessarily indicative of the CAD that may be generated in future periods. (c) “Costs related to shareholder litigation” include expenses incurred as a result of the securities litigation and the shareholder derivative demands. See Note 10—Contingencies of Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, these costs include the costs associated with the Company’s response to a subpoena it received from the SEC in November 2014. In July 2016, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC notified the Company that it had concluded its investigation into the Company. (d) “Large Dispositions” are defined as transactions involving the sale of timberland that exceed $20 million in size and do not have a demonstrable premium relative to timberland value. In January 2017, the Company completed a disposition of approximately 25,000 acres of timberland located in Alabama for a sales price and gain of approximately $42.0 million and $28.2 million, respectively. In December 2017, the Company completed a second disposition of approximately 25,000 acres of timberland located in Alabama for a sales price and gain of approximately $53.4 million and $38.8 million, respectively. (e) Cash interest paid is presented net of patronage refunds received of $3.7 million and $3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. (f) Pro forma revenues (sales) is defined as revenues (sales) adjusted for Large Dispositions. Rayonier believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate our core business operations because it excludes specific items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results. (g) Pro forma net income is defined as net income attributable to Rayonier Inc. adjusted for costs related to shareholder litigation and Large Dispositions. Rayonier believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate our core business operations because it excludes specific items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results. (h) Pro forma operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) adjusted for costs related to shareholder litigation and Large Dispositions. Rayonier believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate our core business operations because it excludes specific items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results. (i) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, the non-cash cost of land and improved development, costs related to shareholder litigation and Large Dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to make strategic decisions about the business and that investors can use to evaluate the operational performance of the assets under management. It removes the impact of specific items that management believes do not directly reflect the core business operations on an ongoing basis.
