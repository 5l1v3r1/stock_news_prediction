Musk has been very critical of media coverage of Tesla lately. He accused media companies of \"holier-than-thou\" hypocrisy and said distrust of journalists was key to President Donald Trump's election. 3:48 PM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 03:02\nElon Musk has registered the domain name \"Pravduh.com\" days after fiercely criticizing the media and saying he would build start a website to rate the \"core truth\" and \"credibility\" of articles and reporters.\nIt is another move suggesting the CEO of electric car maker Tesla may be moving forward on such a project. Musk had previously said he would name his site \"Pravda\" after the Soviet Communist newspaper, but that name has already been taken.\nTesla was not immediately available for comment.\nMusk has recently railed against reporters, whom he has criticized of focusing negative coverage on Tesla.\nRecent media coverage of Tesla includes reports on crashes involving Tesla cars. In several cases, they have drawn attention from federal agencies such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Traffic Safety Board over the possible involvement of Tesla's driver assistance technology, called Autopilot.\nSeveral media outlets, including CNBC, have also reported on labor issues at the factory .\nMusk's relationship with Wall Street has also received attention, particularly given the company's need for capital and a recent earnings call where Musk brushed off queries from analysts as \"boring, bonehead questions.\"\nMusk's comments also also come days after reviewer Consumer Reports decided not to recommend the Tesla Model 3 midsize sedan , after it found the vehicle had the longest stopping distance of any contemporary car it has tested.\nSome of Tesla's efforts have earned media praise. Consumer Reports gives the Model S the highest rating in the ultra luxury class, and many early Model 3 reviews mostly praised the vehicle .\nMusk said Wednesday on Twitter that the public no longer respects \"big media companies\" because they \"lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T23:26:58.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
