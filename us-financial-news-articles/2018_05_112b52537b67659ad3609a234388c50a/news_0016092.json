REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nBlackstone’s $27.50-per-share offer represents a premium of 15.4 percent to Gramercy’s close on Friday at $23.82.\nThe deal will add to Blackstone’s real estate business, which has emerged as a bigger contributor to earnings in recent years than its private equity division.\nBlackstone earlier this year elevated Jonathan Gray, who turned the buyout firm into the world’s biggest real estate investor, to president and chief operating officer, setting him up as successor to Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman.\nThe acquisition has an equity value of $4.42 billion, according to Reuters’ calculations. Gramercy’s total liabilities, as of March 31, were $3.14 billion.\nGramercy’s shareholders will receive a second-quarter dividend of 37.5 cents per share.\nThe deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, Gramercy said.\nMorgan Stanley was Gramercy’s financial adviser, while Citigroup and BofA Merrill Lynch advised Blackstone.
