They offered prayers and snapped pictures as her casket was carried outside following a service.

REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\nThe funeral prayers in Stafford, Texas, about 35 miles (56 km) east of Santa Fe, were attended by local politicians, including Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, and drew a crowd of several hundred that spilled onto the surrounding grounds.\nA handful of men carried signs with slogans calling for improved background checks and higher age limits for gun purchases. One sign read simply: “Thou Shall Not Kill.”\nAmong the throng was a group of about a half-dozen men who said they were streaming the event live via Facetime telephone video to members of the slain girl’s family watching from Karachi, Pakistan.\nSpeaking to a Reuters correspondent on the Facetime call, a man who identified himself as Shabika’s father, Aziz Sheikh, said, “Everyone is very sad and praying for her.” He added that he wished to give “thanks to the Lord for all these communities from the bottom of my heart. It’s emotional to see all the people come out.”\nOne of the men outside the mosque in Texas, Zaheer Khan, described himself as a close friend of the Sheikh family who remembered the girl as having aspirations to work in the field of women’s rights and education.
