This only equates to a small fossil-fuel power plant but it has potential to expand as storage becomes cheaper and generation becomes less centralized.\nThe company has teamed up with grid companies to help iron out imbalances in transmission networks by aggregating battery owners to operate as a single “virtual” power plant.\nIn 2016, sonnen received 76 million euros from investors, including China’s Envision. Ostermann said the 76 million euros plus the latest funding round would cover investment for the next two years.\n“It is important for us to have leg room, as we are a growth company and need to develop,” he said.\nOther sonnen investors include Germany’s eCapital and MVP, Dutch firm SET Ventures, Czech company Inven Capital, and GE Ventures, a unit of U.S. firm General Electric.\nThe investment from Shell, which operates in 140 countries, would help sonnen expand into new areas, Ostermann said.\nThe company boosted turnover by 65 percent to 65 million euros in 2017, outpacing growth in German solar battery sales of 30 percent, Ostermann said, adding that a stock market listing (IPO) was a possibility but was not on the immediate horizon.\nReporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T07:22:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
