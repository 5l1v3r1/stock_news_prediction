People wait outside the JSW mine where coal miners are missing underground after a strong quake hit a mine in Jastrzebie Zdroj, Poland May 5, 2018. Agencja Gazeta/Dominik Gajda via REUTERS\n“Rescuers have found one of the three missing miners who shows no sign of life,” JSW said in a statement, without providing more details. A doctor has yet to confirm he is dead.\nThe quake struck the Borynia-Zofiowka-Jastrzebie mine in southern Poland a week ago, trapping seven miners. Two were found dead and two others have been rescued.\nAbout 250 people were working underground at the time of the quake. The missing miners were in a team drilling a new tunnel.\nThe 3.5-4.0 magnitude quake was the strongest recorded in the mine, officials there said.
