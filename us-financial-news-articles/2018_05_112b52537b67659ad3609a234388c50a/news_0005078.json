The right-hander allowed two runs on six hits with four strikeouts and two walks after failing to notch a win in his last four starts.\nRyan Madson threw a scoreless eighth for the Nationals before Brandon Kintzler took care of the ninth and earned his first save.\nJameson Taillon (2-3) got the loss despite pitching well for the Pirates, allowing three runs on seven hits, but the offense could not give him enough support.\nWashington jumped out to a 3-0 lead thanks to three RBI singles in the first four innings.\nDifo got the first one, and that came in the second inning and gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead. Roark then helped his own cause with an RBI single in the fourth, and Turner followed with another six pitches later.\nPittsburgh then began chipping away at the three-run lead. Taillon also helped his cause with an RBI double in the fifth.\nCorey Dickerson cut the lead to 3-2 with a solo homer off Roark in the seventh, but the Pirates could do no more.\nThird baseman Anthony Rendon is getting closer to coming back to the Washington lineup. He’s been out since April 13 when he banged a foul ball off his toe. MLB.com reported that he did a full workout before Monday’s game and could return shortly.\nThe Nationals called up right-hander Wander Suero Monday and optioned fellow pitcher Austin Voth back to Triple-A Syracuse. He pitched just once since being called up.\nMLB.com also reported that Pirates righty Nick Kingham will stay in the rotation and start Friday versus Milwaukee. Kingham carried a perfect game into the seventh on Sunday in his first major league start.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:07:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
