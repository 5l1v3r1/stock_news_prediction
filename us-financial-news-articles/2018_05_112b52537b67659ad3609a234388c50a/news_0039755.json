Netflix revealed its current membership level was 125 million subscribers at the end of its first quarter.\nThe firm's forecast implies \"just 35% of our global ex-China 2030 broadband household estimates, which we think is reasonable,\" Schindler said.\nNetflix is the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year.
