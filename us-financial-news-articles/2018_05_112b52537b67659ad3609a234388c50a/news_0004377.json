FILE PHOTO - Cho Hyun-min, a former Korean Air senior executive and the younger daughter of the airline's chairman Cho Yang-ho, arrives at a police station in Seoul, South Korea, May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nCho Hyun-min, the younger sister of the notorious “nut rage” heiress of the airline, who got into trouble over a petulant outburst in 2014, is being investigated over accusations that she threw a drink at people at a business meeting last month.\nCho, 34, made a tearful apology during a media scrum on Monday when she made her first appearance for questioning at Seoul’s Gangseo police station, which is leading the investigation.\n“The Seoul Gangseo police station requested an arrest warrant for a former senior vice president, Cho Hyun-min, related to the case of assault and obstruction of business,” the police said in a statement.\nCho denied any wrongdoing during questioning, police said.\nPolice said prosecutors would decide whether to send the request to court for a ruling on her arrest.\nInvestigators fear evidence in the case may have been destroyed, police added in the statement.\n“As a result of digital forensics, there is a risk of destroyed evidence, given circumstances where Korean Air discussed measures to save the situation,” they said.\nKorean Air declined to comment on Friday.\nThe younger Cho stepped down from her position at the airline after her father, Cho Yang-ho, its chairman, apologized for the behaviour of his daughters.\nThe younger sister’s tantrum has reignited public impatience with family-run conglomerates known as chaebol that dominate South Korea’s economy, over what some people see as unchecked bad behaviour by the rich and powerful.\n“Police will thoroughly investigate and take stern action against gapjil,” the police statement said, using a Korean term for high-handness by those in positions of power.
