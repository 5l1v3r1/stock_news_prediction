The Diamondbacks have lost four straight and 10 of 11.\nArizona left-hander Jorge De La Rosa (0-2) retired the first two batters he faced in the seventh before the Mets built their tie-breaking rally. After Tomas Nido singled, Cabrera, pinch-hitting for starting pitcher Noah Syndergaard, got ahead of De La Rosa 2-0 and the fouled off four straight pitches before hitting his third career pinch-hit homer.\nRosario, who homered for the Mets’ first run in the sixth, followed by completing his first two-homer day as a major leaguer.\nSyndergaard (4-1) allowed one run on six hits and one walk while striking out seven over seven innings. He pitched seven innings for the second time in 10 starts this season. The Mets have had a starter pitch into the seventh just seven times in 42 games.\nJerry Blevins got the first out of the eighth and Robert Gsellman recorded the final five outs for his first major league save.\nJarrod Dyson had three hits for the Diamondbacks and scored the only run in the second, when he raced home from third on Jeff Mathis’ groundout.\nClay Buchholz, making his first major league start in 13 months, allowed one run on two hits and one walk while striking out two over five-plus innings. Buchholz, mixing a high-80s fastball with a curveball and changeup, retired 10 straight before Rosario homered leading off the sixth.\nThe 33-year-old right-hander was limited to two starts last season due to a torn flexor tendon in his right arm, which he suffered pitching against the Mets on April 11, 2017.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:35:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
