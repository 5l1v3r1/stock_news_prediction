But thanks to the opening of a new Lice Clinics of America® clinic, parents in Camden and Burlington Counties no longer have to worry about treating the icky bugs themselves.\nLice Clinics of America – Marlton ( http://www.liceclinicsjersey.com ) provides screening, diagnosis and treatment options for people infested with head lice. The clinic is staffed by certified operators of the AirAllé ® device, an FDA-cleared medical device that kills head lice and lice eggs using just heated air.\n“The three keys to beating head lice are education, communication, and technology,” said clinic manager Lori Schleinkofer. “First, people need to know that head lice has nothing to do with hygiene. That myth often keeps people from seeking treatment.“ To facilitate education in schools, Lori and her team work closely with school nurses, and have received great interest from the New Jersey State School Nurses Association.\n“Second, when it comes to communication, it’s important that parents let their friends and classmates’ parents know when they are dealing with head lice,” Lori said. “Early detection can make treatment easier and more effective.”\nThen there is technology: “We have an FDA-cleared medical device that is clinically proven to kill live lice and more than 99 percent of lice eggs,” Lori said. “It was developed by a university professor and clinically proven to be effective. There’s no doubt about its effectiveness.”\nThe AirAllé medical device uses carefully controlled warm air to dehydrate lice and eggs. Most treatments take about an hour, and the treatment is guaranteed to be effective. The AirAllé has successfully treated more than 350,000 cases of head lice worldwide with a success rate better than 99 percent.\nThe Marlton clinic is located at 925 Route 73 N, Suite E, Marlton, NJ 08053 and is open seven days per week by appointment.\nWith more than 300 clinics in 34 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences TM , Inc., which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nLori Schleinkofer Lice Clinics of America (856) 334-2589 info@liceclinicsjersey.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f040da82-7f6d-4f20-87ea-54eece60d2d7/en"], "published": "2018-05-03T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T19:25:01.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
