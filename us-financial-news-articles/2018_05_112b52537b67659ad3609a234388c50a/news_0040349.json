(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DFBG), a branded portfolio of operating companies in the apparel, footwear and accessories sectors comprised of Hudson Jeans, Robert Graham and SWIMS, today announced EBITDA of $1.5 million driven by a 12% jump in Consumer Direct sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nTotal Company net sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 3% from the same period last year to $38.8 million. Comparable retail stores net sales at both Robert Graham and SWIMS increased 16% as both full price and outlet stores contributed strong double digit sales gains across the brands which helped drive the 12% improvement at Consumer Direct. Wholesale segment sales declined 8% as improvements at Robert Graham were offset by reductions at Hudson and SWIMS.\nMichael Buckley, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our stores at both Robert Graham and SWIMS outperformed during the first quarter by posting significant comparable store sales gains. The Consumer Direct segment produces margins that are on average 27 points better than Wholesale, thus we did not see as much margin erosion from the Wholesale segment decline. Department store brick and mortar shoppers continue to slowly migrate toward ecommerce channels. This ecommerce migration has had some impact on Hudson’s channel distribution. Our SWIMS wholesale business was impacted by a timing difference related to outgoing shipments in early Q2 that were scheduled for late Q1.”\nMr. Buckley continued, “We remain committed to test a retail store in the U.S. for Hudson, and Hudson’s roll-out of sportswear is on schedule for Fall 18’. Robert Graham has revitalized its Women’s offering in Spring 18’ and is poised to invest in this category as a major avenue of future growth. Robert Graham also executed a new license for tailored clothing during the quarter. Lastly, at SWIMS, our Spring 18’ expanded assortment has been met with high regard from the market, and we expect to see a favorable impact in the second quarter of 2018. The assortment expansion augers well for the Fall 18’ season. SWIMS' first company-owned full price retail store location, in Oslo, Norway, is on schedule to open in the Fall of 2018.”\nSegment net sales and adjusted EBITDA results were as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited, in thousands) Net sales: Wholesale $ 28,670 $ 31,144 Consumer Direct 9,364 8,346 Corporate and other 784 613 Total Company net sales $ 38,818 $ 40,103 Adjusted EBITDA Operating income (loss): Wholesale $ 6,156 $ 8,357 Consumer Direct (143 ) (1,213 ) Corporate and other (6,569 ) (7,449 ) Adjustments* 2,100 2,847 Total Company Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,544 $ 2,542 *See “Adjusted EBITDA” below for reconciliation with GAAP.\nFirst Quarter Financial Review\nTotal Company net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased 3% to $38.8 million, reflecting a 12% increase in Consumer Direct segment sales and an 8% decrease in Wholesale segment sales. The Consumer Direct increase was driven by a 16% comparable stores net sales increase. At Robert Graham and SWIMS, both full price and outlet stores performed double digit ‘comps’. In regard to the Wholesale segment, Robert Graham improved its business to mid-single digit growth versus the same quarter last year. However, Robert Graham’s Wholesale sales improvement was offset by declines at Hudson and SWIMS. SWIMS decrease related to delayed receipt flow that shifted some revenue into early second quarter while Hudson booked less sales volume as a product of its customers continuing to have some difficulty navigating the consumer shift to the on-line distribution channel. Hudson is working with certain retailers to help navigate this shift, such as offering a drop shipment service for major retail customers, as well as developing new relationships with meaningful emerging premium on-line retailers.\nGross profit was $16.3 million this quarter, compared to $18.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Last year’s gross profit was impacted by a benefit of $1.4 million related to a one-time accounting change of the valuation of inventory (refer to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for details). On a comparable basis, gross profit last year was $17.2 million or $0.9 million over the first quarter 2018. This reduction primarily relates to the Wholesale net sales decline this quarter which more than offset Consumer Direct margin gains. Gross profit margin on a comparable basis was 41.9% compared to 42.9% last year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $15.3 million compared to $17.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39.5% from 43.4% in the first quarter of 2017. These improvements relate to the permanent re-structure of certain Wholesale selling commissions and efficiencies gained by consolidating certain administrative functions.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.5 million as compared to $2.5 million for the same quarter last year. Last year’s adjusted EBITDA included the one-time $1.4 million accounting adjustment for inventory valuation that benefited gross profit. Without the adjustment, first quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA would have exceeded last year by $0.4 million.\nFor the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, net loss and loss per share were $4.1 million and $0.43 per share compared to $2.4 million and $0.28 per share, respectively.\nAbout Differential Brands Group\nDifferential Brands Group Inc.
