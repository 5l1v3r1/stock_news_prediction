Tesla representatives were not immediately available for comment.\nMusk interrupted two analysts asking questions on Wednesday night's conference call after Tesla reported a first-quarter loss that beat expectations. He referred to one analyst's query as a \"boring bonehead\" question, said the \"dry\" discussion was \"killing\" him and then had a lengthy exchange with a Tesla shareholder and blogger on several topics, despite Tesla's normal rule of allowing only one question per person.\nMusk's behavior marred what otherwise was a good quarter with some positive signs, Albertine said.\nAlbertine said that although Musk simply seemed frustrated, his behavior fueled Tesla \"naysayers\" by making him look \"unglued or unhinged.\"\nMusk has to remember that in some way he works for the shareholders, Albertine said, and the analysts are acting as the voice of Tesla's large institutional investors on conference calls.\n\"I thought it was disrespectful and inadvisable, and I have never in my career certainly have heard any CEO act that way,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T18:04:28.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
