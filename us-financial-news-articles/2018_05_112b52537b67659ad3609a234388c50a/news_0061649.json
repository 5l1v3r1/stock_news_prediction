They bought a record $2.57 billion worth of Spanish bonds in March.\nTo view a graphic on Roller-coaster ride for Italian bonds, click: reut.rs/2Lc7gVI FILE PHOTO: Presentation of a new 2 Euro commemorative coin of former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in Berlin, Germany, February 2, 2018. REUTERS/Christian Mang FIRMER GROUND\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield IT10YT=RR was down 21 bps at 2.84 percent, while the Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread tightened to 250 bps from 293 bps late on Wednesday. IT10YT=RR DE10YT=RR\nStill, that spread has increased more than 100 basis points this month - the biggest monthly spread widening since 2011.\nItalian five-year credit default swaps fell 19 basis points from Wednesday’s close to 233 bps, according to data from IHS Markit.\n“The two-year (yield) move was obviously greatly exaggerated and all were pricing an inversion of the yield curve and thinking this will end very badly,” said Carl Hammer, head of global macro and FX research at SEB in Stockholm.\n“We don’t anticipate a crisis in Italy but there will be more worries so it will be a factor for investors to consider until they get some clarification.”\nThere was some focus on Spain, where Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s hours in office appeared numbered after reports that a Basque political party would back a no-confidence vote over a corruption case.\nStill, Spain’s 10-year bond yield was down 10 bps at 1.51 percent ES10YT=RR as the rebound in Italian bonds supported peripheral bond markets.\nYields on top-rated euro zone bonds were also lower in late European trade, reversing earlier rises, after a sharp fall in Deutsche Bank shares and renewed concerns about a trade war re-ignited demand for safe-haven bonds.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield was down 1.5 bps at 0.33 percent DE10YT=RR, but remained well above a 13-month low hit on Tuesday at 0.19 percent.\nData showing inflation in the euro area rose to 1.9 percent in May from 1.2 percent in April, well above expectations, had pressured most bond markets earlier on.\nTo view a graphic on Euro zone bond markets in May, click: reut.rs/2Jk3BYg Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Abhinav Ramnarayan; Additional reporting by Claire Milhench and Sujata Rao; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Richard Balmforth", "external_links": ["https://reut.rs/2Lc7gVI"], "published": "2018-05-31T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:06:53.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
