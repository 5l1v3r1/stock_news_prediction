His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\nProsecutors said Hallinan operated payday lending companies with names like Easy Cash, Apex 1 Processing and Payday Loan Direct and directed some to charge fees that resulted in annual interest rates of 780 percent.\nMore than a dozen states effectively prohibit payday lending, while many others impose limits on payday loans.\nProsecutors said Hallinan and Neff conspired to evade those state laws by paying three native tribes to pretend they were the actual lenders in order to claim sovereign immunity.\nU.S. Attorney William McSwain in a statement said Neff preyed on people who were struggling by drafting sham contracts for Hallinan and another payday lender, Adrian Rubin, who engaged in a similar scheme.\n“As an attorney, Mr. Neff should realize that a civilized society requires obedience to the law, including those laws he didn’t happen to like,” McSwain said.\nProsecutors said Neff also helped Hallinan defraud borrowers pursuing a class action against Apex 1 Processing by making it appear it had no assets and was owned by a Canadian who was a hereditary chief of the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation in British Columbia.\nIn total, Hallinan’s companies generated $688 million in revenue from 2008 to 2013 from hundreds of thousands of customers, prosecutors said.\nHallinan is scheduled to be sentenced on July 6. Rubin pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges in 2015 and has yet to be sentenced.
