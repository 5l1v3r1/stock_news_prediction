Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports\nAriya rolled in a 12-foot birdie at the second extra hole to beat Japan’s Nasa Hataoka, after the pair had eliminated South Korean Chun In-gee with matching birdies at the first extra hole at Kingsmill Resort in Williamsburg.\nIn a tournament shortened to 54 holes due to wet weather, Ariya shot a closing five-under-par 66 for a 14-under 199 total.\nShe said she had adopted a fatalistic approach to the final round.\n“I did not feel that much pressure because I did a great job today. So whatever, I’m going to win or lose,” she said.\nIt is the first time since 1991 that the season has gone so long without a repeat champion, according to the LPGA Tour.\nFormer world number one Ariya became the second Thai winner on the LPGA Tour this year after her older sister Moriya claimed the L.A. Open in April.\nSouth Korean remains the dominant nation on the LPGA circuit with four wins this season, while three have been claimed by Americans.
