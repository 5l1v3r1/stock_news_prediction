Why didn't it work?' You will get better so quickly,\" Chen says.\nHowever, if you're starting a business and you view every obstacle or setback like failing a test, Chen says you might think: \"'This must mean I'm bad at something or this thing isn't solvable.' And then you just stop trying and you will definitely fail at that point.\"\nshow chapters 4 ways to deal with a nightmare co-worker 9:50 AM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 | 01:51 There are famous college dropouts who became self-made billionaires, like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.\nAnd other successful moguls have questioned whether schools teach you everything you need to be successful in business. Much like Chen, British billionaire and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson has criticized the inflexible guidelines of school exams. \"Children are taught to pass exams rather than understand concepts and expand their minds,\" Branson wrote in a blog post in January.\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are also both adamant that there's plenty to learn outside of college.\n\"The best education you can get is investing in yourself. But this doesn't always mean college or university,\" Buffett says .\nMeanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk has such misgivings about the U.S. education system that he created his own primary school in Southern California for his five children.\nFor what it's worth, NerdWallet's Chen still \"totally\" believes that people should go to school — \"You learn a lot of core skills,\" he says. Even a famous college dropout like Bill Gates has called the high college dropout rates in the U.S. \"tragic,\" noting that the country could see a shortage of skilled workers as a result.\nCertainly, despite the allure of stories about self-made millionaires and billionaires who never finished school, college graduates see more job opportunities and earn more than non-graduates on average. In fact, a 2017 study that looked at the backgrounds of more than 11,700 U.S. \"leaders\" — from Fortune 500 CEOs to members of Congress — found that 94 percent of them attended college.\nDon't Miss:\nThe 3 most common financial mistakes young people make, according NerdWallet's self-made millionaire founder\nThese 3 Silicon Valley billionaires want to make schools more like start-ups\nLike this story?
