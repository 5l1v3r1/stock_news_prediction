(NYSE:BOX), a leader in cloud content management, today announced first quarter of fiscal 2019, which ended April 30, 2018.\n“In the first quarter, we drove strong attach rates for new products, expanded our international customer base and delivered product innovation and security for some of the largest and most regulated enterprises in the world,” said Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box. “With customers like Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Dignity Health and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) choosing Box to power their digital workplace, our focus on security and collaboration, as well as our vision for artificial intelligence, continues to resonate.”\n“We delivered solid top line growth and improved cash flow from operations by $10 million year-over-year in the first quarter,” said Dylan Smith, co-founder and CFO of Box. “Our continued focus on driving higher product attach rates and expanding our penetration in the large enterprise market position us for long-term growth on our path to $1 billion and beyond.”\nAdoption of the New Revenue Recognition Standard - ASC Topic 606\nBox adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”) on a modified retrospective basis, effective February 1, 2018. Financial results for reporting periods in Box’s fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 are presented in compliance with the new revenue recognition standard. Historical financial results for reporting periods prior to fiscal 2019 are presented in conformity with amounts previously disclosed under the prior revenue recognition standard Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605 (“ASC 605”). This press release includes additional information regarding Box’s quarter ended April 30, 2018 under ASC 605 for comparison to the prior year.\nFiscal First Quarter Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was a record $140.5 million, an increase of 20% (ASC 606 in fiscal 2019 compared to ASC 605 in fiscal 2018) and 22% (ASC 605 in fiscal 2019 compared to ASC 605 fiscal 2018) from the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Deferred revenue as of April 30, 2018 was $286.9 million, an increase of 28% (ASC 606 to ASC 605) and 31% (ASC 605 to ASC 605) from April 30, 2017. Billings for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $116.7 million, an increase of 17% (ASC 606 to ASC 605 and ASC 605 to ASC 605) from the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

This compares to GAAP operating loss of $40.0 million, or 34% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.07 (ASC 606) and $0.08 (ASC 605). This compares to non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.13 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 totaled $18.4 million. This compares to net cash provided by operating activities of $8.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Free cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $7.3 million. This compares to $4.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics discussed in this press release, please see the section titled, “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics,” and the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and certain key metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\nBusiness Highlights since Last Earnings Release\nGrew paying customer base to more than 85,000 businesses, including new or expanded deployments with leading organizations such as Blackboard, City of Philadelphia, DARPA, Dignity Health, Hitachi High Technologies, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and Pokémon.

These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of Box’s Investor Relations website located at www.box.com/investors . Box does not assume any obligation to update the contained in this press release to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics\nTo supplement Box’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Box provides investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures and other key metrics, including non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, billings and free cash flow. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics, please see the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and certain key metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\nBox uses these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Box’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Box’s performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of Box’s recurring core business operating results. Box believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics in assessing Box’s performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Box’s historical performance as well as comparisons to Box’s competitors' operating results. Box believes these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by Box’s institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of Box’s business.\nA limitation of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics is that they do not have uniform definitions. Further, Box’s definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, Box’s non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based compensation expense, if Box did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based compensation expense, the cash salary expense included in cost of revenue and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect Box’s cash position.\nNon-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP operating margin. Box defines non-GAAP operating loss as operating loss excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation (“SBC”), intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating loss divided by revenue. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of Box’s employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments Box utilizes involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of Box’s ongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond Box’s control. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of stock-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of Box’s core business and to facilitate comparison of Box’s results to those of peer companies. Management also views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology and trade names, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Box further excludes expenses related to certain litigation because they are considered by management to be special items outside Box’s core operating results.\nNon-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. Box defines non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding expenses related to SBC, intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Box defines non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted average outstanding shares. Box excludes expenses related to certain litigation because they are considered by management to be special items outside Box’s core operating results.\nBillings. Billings reflect, in any particular period, (1) sales to new customers, plus (2) subscription renewals and (3) expansion within existing customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all products and professional services. Box calculates billings for a period by adding changes in deferred revenue and contract assets in that period to revenue. Box believes that billings help investors better understand sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in revenue as a result of the fact that Box recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the subscription term. Box considers billings a significant performance measure and, after adjusting for any shifts in relative payment frequencies, a leading indicator of future revenue. Box monitors billings to manage the business, make planning decisions, evaluate performance and allocate resources. Box believes that billings offers valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of the business and will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of the business. Although Box considers billings to be a significant performance measure, Box does not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated using exclusively revenue, deferred revenue, and contract assets, all of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFree cash flow. Box defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of capital lease obligations, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of Box’s core business. Box specifically identifies adjusting items in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-18, Restricted Cash, historically, these adjusting items include the use and release of restricted cash to guarantee a significant letter of credit for Box’s Redwood City headquarters. Box considers free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in Box’s business and strengthening its balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nThe accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and certain key metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Box\nBox (NYSE:BOX) is the cloud content management company that empowers enterprises to revolutionize how they work by securely connecting their people, information and applications.
