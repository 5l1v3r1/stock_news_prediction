We have achieved all of our financial goals and are growing through collaboration with new and existing customers and partners. Our customers have entrusted us to execute projects with innovative solutions that could ultimately lead to new advances in critical social functions. The overall aim of all our projects and business ventures is to solve major social problems that must be addressed in the foreseeable future. Helping customers to improve the efficiency and quality of patient care and increase cybersecurity in critical social functions is Sectra's most significant contribution to a more sustainable society.\n\"A year ago, our order bookings looked somewhat worrying, but after the most recent quarter we are ending the fiscal year with a healthy order book. This will provide a solid foundation for continued growth. Sectra has stable underlying operations, with favorable profitability and cash flow. We also have a number of highly exciting projects in the pipeline that could eventually become major endeavors, although, as always, there are no guarantees with such projects.\n\"It is rewarding to lead and work for a company with satisfied customers and employees who do an outstanding job every day. The Group's performance is a result of our targeted efforts to understand our customers' environments and of our culture, with employees who truly care about and assume responsibility for our customers. I am incredibly proud of the Sectra culture and the way it is ingrained in every operating area in the company. This further strengthens our reputation and helps to boost our profitability. This ultimately benefits our customers, employees and shareholders—and, above all, the patients who benefit from our medical IT systems and the citizens of the democratic, open societies protected by our security solutions.\nFor further CEO comments and information, see the attached year-end report.\nPresentation of the year-end report\nA presentation will be held by Torbjörn Kronander, President and CEO of Sectra AB, and Mats Franzén, CFO of Sectra AB.
