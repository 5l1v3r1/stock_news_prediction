And the one listed one is by far the most competitive and growing the most aggressively,” he said.\nMuthaura did not name any companies that might be planning Kenyan listings but said an industry masterplan had set targets of at least three or four listings a year for the period to 2023.\nEast Africa’s richest economy plans a $1 billion dual listing of its state oil company by early 2019, which Muthaura said may serve as a test case for such offerings.\n“Government by and large is able to fix issues, change the law if the law needs to be changed, address tax issues, support infrastructure investment, so that then now the ground is very clear for others who want to follow,” he said.
