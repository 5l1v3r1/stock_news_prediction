(NASDAQ: SAFM) today announced that its Board of Directors has extended to May 31, 2021, its stock repurchase program. The Board has also increased the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be purchased under the program to 2.0 million shares, an increase from the 1.0 million shares previously authorized.

The Company has repurchased 1,482,099 shares under this stock repurchase program since its inception. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time.\n“We plan to use our stock repurchase program to offset shares issued through our equity compensation programs and as a strategic use of the Company’s cash,” stated Joe F.
