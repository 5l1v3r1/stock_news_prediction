The company said it supports Ibama and Brazil’s conservation efforts.\nRepresentatives for the other traders could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe fines were a phase of “Operation Soy Sauce” carried out since April in which Ibama and federal prosecutors clamped down on illegal land use in the Matopiba region - comprising Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí and Bahia states - in Brazil’s Cerrado savannah.\nThe Cerrado is one of the fastest growing soy regions thanks to cheap and abundant virgin land that is also subject to far less stringent rules on deforestation than those applied to the Amazon rainforest.\nRenê Luiz de Oliveira, the head of environmental enforcement at Ibama, said illegal deforestation of the Cerrado savannah was advancing much faster in Matopiba than in other regions of the biome.\n“This requires stepping up control strategies to deter every illegal link in the supply chain,” he said in the Ibama statement.\nThe operation focused on areas that had already been illegally deforested and had been declared out of bounds by Ibama, in order to allow native vegetation to regrow.\nDozens of farmers were fined for producing grains in these areas, for preventing the regrowth of the native vegetation or otherwise seeking to trade products originating in the banned areas.\nTrading firms had purchased grains under advanced purchase agreements that in some cases financed the illegal farming to be carried out, Ibama said.\nThe statement said public prosecutors planned to take legal action beyond the fines to ensure the offenders repair all environmental damage.\nReporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:19:10.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
