(the \"Company\" or \"Covalon\") (TSXV: COV; OTCQX: CVALF), an advanced medical technologies company, today announced some major corporate initiatives and second quarter results.\nFormation of Special Committee\nCovalon has established a Special Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) to evaluate potential acquisitions, strategic alliances, and partnerships in response to the interest generated following the Company’s recent announcement of its $100 million contract awards in the Middle East. The Board believes that the capital markets have not yet fully appreciated the impact of the highly transformative recent announcement of $100 million of contracted revenue over the next three years in addition to the many other significant initiatives underway. The Committee’s mandate is to assist management in evaluating all of these potential initiatives in order to maximize full value for shareholders. The Committee is comprised of Dr. Murray Miller, Lead Director, who will serve as Chair of the Special Committee, Mr. Martin Bernholtz, Chair of Covalon’s Audit Committee, and Mr. Abe Schwartz, Chair of Covalon’s Board of Directors.\nSignificant progress being made on evaluation of potential acquisitions\nCovalon is making significant progress as it carefully assesses numerous opportunities for potential acquisitions. The Company has identified a clear set of criteria for potential acquisitions that would both compliment and accelerate Covalon’s internal growth. Covalon’s recent announcement of its $100 million contract awards in the Middle East has resulted in additional potentially accretive opportunities for consideration by the Company.\nCovalon to consider the potential for buy-back of common shares of the Company\nIn addition to the initiatives of the Special Committee and in light of the current market price, the Board will consider the potential for the buy-back of common shares of the Company, pursuant to a Normal Course Issuer Bid at the appropriate time, and subject to regulatory approval.\nCovalon intends to utilize operating cash flows and non-dilutive sources of cash to accomplish initiatives currently contemplated\nThe Company anticipates that current cash requirements, including potential acquisitions, will be met by cash generated from sales and non-dilutive debt, without the need to raise capital via the sale of shares.\nSecond Quarter Results\nThe Company posted second quarter revenue of $5,727,275 and a net loss of $479,082 for the three months ended March 31 st 2018 , and revenue of $12,131,980 and net income of $44,263 for the six months ended March 31 st 2018.\nMr. Brian Pedlar, Covalon’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Based on second quarter results and anticipated business in the second half of the fiscal year, the Company is very much on track to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017’s $27.3 million in revenue. Our revenue in the United States has more than doubled in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to last year. Our Middle East contracted deliveries are unfolding according to our delivery expectations, without taking into account any of the $100 million of contracted revenue over the following three years. I am very pleased with our performance year-to-date.\n“More importantly, Covalon has never been on better financial and operational footing in its entire history. The Company currently has a clean balance sheet with no debt, has secured significant future contracted revenues, and has more than 150 United States FDA-cleared products and over 30 patents to protect its world-class technology platforms. We are working on many positive initiatives and are exploring many different expressions of interest,” continued Mr. Pedlar.\nConference Call Scheduled\nA conference call to discuss this news release will be held on Tuesday May 29 th 2018 at 9:00am EST.
