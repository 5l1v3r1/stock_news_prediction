NAI welcomed Thursday’s ruling, and said CBS’ special committee had breached its fiduciary obligations to CBS shareholders.\nBouchard said he denied the temporary restraining order because any action that Redstone takes will be subject to his review and “extensive power” to correct. He said CBS had already shown it had a non-frivolous claim against Redstone for a breach of fiduciary duty for her alleged interference with CBS.\nA lawyer for National Amusements dismissed the allegations against Redstone in court on Wednesday.\nThe fast-moving battle for control of the CBS boardroom was put in motion on Sunday, when CBS’s special committee determined the merger with Viacom long-favored by Shari Redstone was not in the interest of CBS shareholders.\nNational Amusements believes a deal is needed for the two media companies to gain scale and compete with the likes of video-streaming company Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ).\nShares of CBS ended down 4.1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $51.61 while shares of Viacom slipped 0.4 percent to $28.16 on Nasdaq.\nReporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; editing by Susan Thomas and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T19:28:47.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
