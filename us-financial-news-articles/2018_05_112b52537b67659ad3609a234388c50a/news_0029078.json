Starting out on an intern's salary, I wasn't able to save much. Even so, I set up an automatic transfer from my checking account to my savings account for the first of every month, and I gradually increased the amount.\nAs my paycheck has grown, so have my savings.\nBy treating my savings like a bill, I don't even consider it money I'm allowed to spend. I've put a mental block in place, so I know this money is off-limits the same way I know I can't spend the money earmarked for rent. Over the last three years, I've been able to save thousands with little to no effort, because the money disappears before I have a chance to think about it.\nMy mom's not the only one doling out this winning advice.

He calls this strategy \"positively financially backwards.\"\nEmmie Martin | CNBC The author with her parents. Bach would also be happy to know that I've made my savings automatic , which he says is another key element of building wealth.\n\"There's no getting around it. In order for 'Pay Yourself First' to be effective, the process has to be automatic,\" Bach writes. \"Whatever you decide to do with the money you're paying yourself … you need to have a system that doesn't depend on your following a budget or being disciplined.\"\nThe lesson here is two-fold: Treat your savings like a bill and always, always listen to your mom.\nThis is an updated version of a previously published article .\nDon't miss:\nHere's how much you need to save each month to be a millionaire in 10 years NFL star Ndamukong Suh shares the best lesson he's learned from his mentor Warren Buffett Warren Buffett doesn't think college is necessary—here's how he learns Like this story?
