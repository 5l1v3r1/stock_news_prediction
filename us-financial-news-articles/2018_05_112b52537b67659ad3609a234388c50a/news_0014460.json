Randal Quarles, Federal Reserve board member and Vice Chair for Supervision, takes part in a swearing-in ceremony for Chairman Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve in Washington, U.S., Febuary 5, 2018.

To the extent you have a machine learning tool that is interacting with customers we want to make sure that the traditional protections are being complied with,” Quarles said.\nWhile the Fed may need “more specialized responses” to the use of artificial intelligence or computer algorithms in assessing risk and making credit decisions, he said he was hesitant to impose “bounds” on what institutions can do, rather than develop “milestones” or circuit breakers that would pause any process that was producing bad results.
