Berkshire is now the third largest Apple shareholder, behind Vanguard and BlackRock .\nIBM and Apple were rivals in the 1980s, but the two companies have taken different paths over the ensuing decades, with IBM struggling with trends in enterprise technology and Apple becoming a dominant force in consumer electronics.\nBuffett spoke to CNBC on Thursday evening from Omaha, Nebraska, where tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders were gathering for Saturday's annual meeting.\nTWEET 1\nâ€” CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
