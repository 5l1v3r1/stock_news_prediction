It also said its first quarter 2017 results were boosted by a non-recurring gain from discontinued operations.\nSavola, like many other retailers in Saudi Arabia, has struggled in the past few years as consumer spending has been sluggish because of a government austerity drive.\nThe company is one of the few listed Gulf companies with operations in Iran. It has an edible oil business in Iran, which had revenues of 2.59 billion riyals last year, as well as smaller food and confectionery operations.\nThe United States has decided to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, leading to new U.S. sanctions on Tehran and pressure on the free market rate of the Iranian rial.\nReporting By Tom Arnold.
