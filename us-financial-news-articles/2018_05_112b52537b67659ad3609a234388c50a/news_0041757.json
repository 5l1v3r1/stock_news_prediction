Some shippers of Iranian oil have said they are ceasing to facilitate such trades because of the new sanctions. Insurance companies are studying whether they may have to reduce or stop their underwriting on the Islamic Republic’s shipments.\nIran, which is the world’s fifth-largest oil exporter and the holder of the second-largest gas reserves in the world, was seen as a huge investment opportunity for companies operating in the industry.\nBut last week, the U.S. said it would pull out of a deal that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear ambitions.\nEuropean allies have said they won’t pull out or enact new sanctions, but many European firms—with U.S. businesses, ties or bank accounts—could be subject to Washington’s sanctions enforcement. Trump administration officials have publicly warned European firms to start to wind down their dealings, but has given companies several months to exit Iran .\nRelated Video After President Donald Trump's big gamble to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal, the focus now shifts to Tehran, the Iranian people and America's allies.

Total has also become a substantial buyer of Iranian crude in the past two years since sanctions were lifted. It had previously said it wouldn’t seek an exemption for those purchases. It declined to comment beyond its statement.\nIn recent days, Wintershall AG, a German energy firm, told its Iranian partners it may not find funding for Iranian oil projects because it relies on its parent company, BASF AG , which has huge chemical operations in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the matter. A Wintershall spokesman said it strictly complies “with all national and international laws and regulations.”\nOn Wednesday, Maersk Tankers AS, one of the world’s largest oil-shipping companies, said it would stop taking assignments for Iranian oil shipments. It said it would wind down any existing customer orders by early November, the deadline set by Washington for the return of oil-related sanctions, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.\nTorm AS, another Danish tanker company, has also “stopped taking new orders in Iran as a consequence of U.S. plans to reimpose sanctions on Tehran,” a spokeswoman said.\nInsurance companies are also tightening scrutiny over new underwriting. The U.S. sanctions “will have a significant impact on the availability” of insurance for Iran oil shipments, said Andrew Bardot, the executive officer of London-based International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs.\nMr. Bardot said the group—a pool of reinsurers that covers around 90% of the world’s tonnage, including tankers—is in discussions with the U.S. government to mitigate the impact of returning U.S. sanctions on insuring Iran oil.\n—Sarah Kent in London contributed to this article.\nWrite to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:49:49.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
