He was the driving force behind the Magnitsky Act, named after Browder's former employee, who died in jail after accusing Russian officials of involvement in a tax fraud scheme.\nBrowder, who is the head of the Hermitage Capital investment fund, said Spanish police took him away when he was heading to meet with prosecutors on Wednesday to share evidence on property investments in Spain with funds allegedly linked to Magnitsky's murder.\nA national police spokeswoman said Browder was released when agents confirmed that an arrest warrant from Russia that appeared in police databases was invalid. The spokeswoman had no authorization to be named in media reports.\nIn December, a Moscow court sentenced Browder to nine years in prison in absentia on charges of tax evasion and funneling money overseas. The financier and Ivan Cherkasov, an associate who was sentenced to eight years behind bars, were also ordered to pay 4 billion rubles ($69 million) to the Russian government in damages.\nThe same court convicted Browder of tax evasion in another trial in absentia in 2013.\nBrowder has dismissed the accusations.\n\"They are using everything they can to stop me, and the abuse of the Interpol system is another example of that,\" Browder told AP after meeting Spain's top anti-corruption prosecutor, Jose Grinda, following his release from detention.\nBrowder said he had shared with Grinda evidence about how 30 million euros ($35 million) allegedly connected to the 2009 murder of Magnitsky had been laundered through investments in Spanish property.\nThe financier, who is a plaintiff in the Spanish investigation, said Spain is among 15 countries following the money trail.\n\"We are hoping that eventually prosecutors here seize property, seize accounts and prosecute individuals so that nobody benefits from the murder of Sergei Magnitsky,\" Browder said.\nThe Magnitsky Act became a sore point between the U.S. and Russia after it was signed into law by former President Barack Obama in 2012. Shortly afterward, President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning American citizens from adopting Russian children, in a move widely viewed as retaliation.\nBrowder himself had reported his detention in Madrid in a series of tweets.\nHe posted a police document with the word \"fraud\" written as the cause for the detention, and then followed it with a photo of himself outside of a police station saying he had been released \"after Interpol General Secretary in Lyon advised them not to honor the new Russian Interpol Red Notice.\"\nHe claimed that \"this is the 6th time that Russia has abused Interpol in my case.\"\n\"Bill Browder remained in police custody this morning for the minimum necessary time, until Interpol Spain verified that the arrest warrant issued by the Russian authorities for tax evasion was invalid,\" according to a Spanish-language tweet by police.\nHowever, in an email, Interpol said it has never issued a Red Notice for Browder. Red Notice alerts are sent to Interpol member countries to locate and arrest specific people based on a national warrant.\nAs early as July 2013, the international police organization said it erased from its database Russian requests to locate and arrest Browder due to its \"predominantly political character.\"\nFair Trials, a global criminal justice watchdog, said the confusion over Browder's arrest highlighted the serious problems with Interpol's system of global \"wanted person\" alerts.\n\"Interpol should scrutinize alerts before it puts them out through its international networks,\" Fair Trials chief executive Jago Russell said in an email Wednesday. \"Spain should also exercise sense and discretion before arresting people. The result could have been very different if it weren't for Browder's high profile.\"\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson welcomed Browder's release, tweeting: \"Just spoken to Bill Browder - very glad that he has now been released.\"\n\"Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of #Magnitsky to justice,\" Johnson added.\nBrowder led one of the biggest investment funds in Russia for 10 years before he left the country and was barred re-entry in 2006 on the grounds that he posed a threat to national security.\nAP reporters Renata Brito and Iain Sullivan in Madrid, Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Elaine Ganley in Paris contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:56:37.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
