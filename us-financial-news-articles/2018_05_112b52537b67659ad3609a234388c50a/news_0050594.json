We do not want to start a fight with these three countries (France, Germany and Britain) but we don’t trust them either,” Khamenei said. “Europe should fully guarantee Iran’s oil sales. In case Americans can damage our oil sales..., Europeans should make up for that and buy Iranian oil.”\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:43:41.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
