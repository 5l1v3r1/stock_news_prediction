Our brand continues to resonate as RYU was recently a finalist in the World Retail Awards.

In the first quarter of 2018 the Company began construction planning at its retail store in Brooklyn, New York and secured the leases to its second and third US store locations in the state of California. This expansion gives RYU exposure in New York City and Los Angeles, the most important urban centers of both coasts of the United States. The three stores are under construction and have targeted openings in the third quarter of 2018.\nE-commerce revenue grew 50% against the same period in 2017 as traffic to ryu.com increased by 57% during the same comparative period.\nRYU secured new strategic wholesale accounts with Nordstrom, Equinox Canada and Rise by We that align with its brand value proposition.\nRYU was selected as a finalist for the World Retail Awards in two categories: Retail Start Up of the Year and Social Media Campaign of the Year (#RYUOneMoreRep). The Company was honoured that RYU was one of only two Canadian companies that qualified as finalists among many global retailers across all the World Retail Awards categories.\nRYU appointed THRSXTY/Exposure, as its new global Agency of Record for creative strategy and marketing services. THRSXTY/Exposure is a marketing services agency based in London, Tokyo, New York, and Paris, specializing in fashion, retail and lifestyle brands.
