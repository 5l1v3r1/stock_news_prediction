The ministry said a switch to quarterly dividends for Aramco meant that impact would be seen in the second quarter.\n“We expect more improvement over the coming quarters, as spending becomes more efficient and as oil and non-oil revenues grow further,” said Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital.\nHe added that Al Rajhi Capital forecasts oil revenues to reach 540 billion riyals in 2018, exceeding government estimates of 490 billion.\nSaudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, does not disclose the oil price assumptions behind its budget. An International Monetary Fund official told Reuters that the Gulf Arab state would need oil prices to average $85-87 a barrel this year to balance its state budget.\n$1 = 3.7503 riyals Reporting By Marwa Rashad and Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by John Stonestreet and Toby Chopra\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:51:07.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
