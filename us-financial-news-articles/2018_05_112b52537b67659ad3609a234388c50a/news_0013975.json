Riley FBR in Boston.\n“The amount of the headline miss that we saw was made up in last month’s revision — so if we missed by 30,000 we revised last month up by 30,000. And earnings went up just a bit, so there’s no pressure of wage prices from the data.”\nAfter choppy futures trading following the payroll numbers, the market opened lower, before reversing course. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 bounced off their 200-day moving averages, a technical level that indicates long-term momentum.\nAt 11:29 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 245.29 points, or 1.03 percent, at 24,175.44, the S&P 500 was up 23.39 points, or 0.89 percent, at 2,653.12 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 91.39 points, or 1.29 percent, at 7,179.54.\nTen of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with only the energy index posting a loss of 0.08 percent.\nAfter a two-day meeting in Beijing, China and the United States reached a consensus on some aspects of their trade row, though some “relatively big” disagreements on other issues remained, China said.\nAmong stocks, Fluor Corp sank 21.2 percent, the most on the S&P, after the engineering and construction company posted a surprise quarterly loss due to issues with a gas-fired power project.\nPandora Media jumped 24.2 percent after the music streaming service provider reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.41-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and for a 2.67-to-1 ratio on the NYSE.\nThe S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 59 new highs and 36 new lows.
