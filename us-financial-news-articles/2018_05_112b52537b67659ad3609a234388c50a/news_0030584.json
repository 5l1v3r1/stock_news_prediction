He grew up around plumbers, mechanics and pilots in a middle-class neighborhood in San Mateo, just south of San Francisco.\nBy Heather Gillers Dawn Lim\nThe investment chief of the nation’s largest public pension said Monday he would leave his post by the end of the year, the latest in a series of executive departures for the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.\nTed Eliopoulos, 54, made the announcement at a public Calpers meeting Monday. The chief investment officer attributed the decision to “significant health considerations” for members of his family. His younger daughter, he said, had been accepted to a school in New York and “I want to make sure that we give her every bit of support as we can as she makes the transition back east.”\nOther top Calpers officials have recently left or announced plans to depart, including longtime fixed-income chief Curtis Ishii. Calpers is responsible for benefits to 1.9 million active or retired police officers, firefighters and other public employees.\nRead: Calpers board elects first female president, Priya Mathur\nEliopoulos led a retreat away from unconventional investments as the giant fund reduced return expectations, cut costs and tried to better protect the pension fund from the next economic downturn.
