REUTERS/Petar Kujundzic/File Photo\nLiu Xia, a poet and artist who suffers from depression, has effectively been under house arrest since her husband won the prize in 2010. Liu Xiaobo died in Chinese custody in July last year, after being denied permission to go abroad for treatment of advanced liver cancer.\nDelayed talks between China and Western governments about the possibility of Liu Xia moving abroad have sparked fears in recent weeks that Beijing will not let her, a Western diplomat involved in the case told Reuters.\n“Now I’ve got nothing to be afraid of. If I can’t leave, I’ll die in my home,” Liu Xia said on Monday in a telephone call with Liao Yiwu, a Chinese writer living in Germany.\nTheir conversation was quoted by Liao on Wednesday in an essay on chinachange.org, a blog that regularly publishes content from Chinese dissidents and activists.\n“Using death to defy could not be any simpler for me,” Liu Xia said, according to the post.\nLiao said he and other friends of Liu Xia had been making preparations for her to come to Germany and receive treatment.\nLiao also released a recording of a previous telephone conversation from April 8, when he encouraged a weeping Liu Xia to keep up hope and continue applying to leave China.\nReuters was unable to reach Liu Xia for comment. China’s justice department did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment on Liao’s essay.\nAsked about the case, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had no understanding of the situation but Liu Xia was a Chinese citizen and relevant authorities would “handle the issue in accordance with the law”. She did not elaborate.\nChina has previously said Liu Xia, as a private citizen, was free to do as she pleased and the details of the case remained an internal affair.\nIn the past, Chinese dissidents have been allowed to leave the country and take up residence in a willing Western nation.\nHowever, since coming to power in 2013, President Xi Jinping has presided over a sweeping campaign to quash dissent throughout Chinese society, detaining hundreds of rights activists and lawyers, with dozens jailed.
