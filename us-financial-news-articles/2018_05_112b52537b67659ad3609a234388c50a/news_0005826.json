Sales grew five percent the last fiscal year.\nClas Ohlson said it aimed for online sales to at least double every other year. They currently account for 3.5 percent of turnover, below market average, it said.\nHowever, the firm set a new operating margin target of 6-8 percent over the same five-year period, down from the previous target of 10 percent. Last year, the margin was 7.8 percent.\nIt said that over the first two years, it expects to invest 1–2 percent of the underlying operating margin in strategic initiatives.\nShares in the Swedish firm were down 0.5 percent at 1207 GMT.\nLast year, 85 percent of its 8 billion crown ($905 million) turnover was generated in Sweden and Norway, and the rest in Finland, Britain, Germany and Dubai.\nThe company said it saw great growth potential in the Nordics and announced the launch of a new “Clas Fix It” service in partnership with service companies developer Pegital Investment.\nThe new service will help customers in Sweden with practical advice on how to use the tools they have bought from Clas Ohlson or carry out do-it-yourself projects for the customer.\n“By developing our offering, we will get closer to our customers’ everyday lives, thereby becoming even more relevant and accessible to them,” CEO Lyra said.\nClas Ohlson in December bought a stake in Swedish online grocery store MatHem​, hoping to reach new customers via MatHem’s website as well as use its fast delivery services to the front door.
