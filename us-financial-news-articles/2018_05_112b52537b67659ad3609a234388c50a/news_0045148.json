Chinese demands for U.S. shipments have taken a hit since Beijing proposed import duties last month.\nThe United States and China launch a second round of trade talks on Thursday to try to avert a damaging tariff war, with the Trump administration demanding a $200 billion cut in China’s U.S. trade surplus and greater protections for intellectual property.\nCBOT July corn futures dipped 3/4 cent to $3.98-1/2 a bushel.\nAdditional reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris and Naveen Thukral in Singapore; Editing by David Goodman and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:45:49.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
