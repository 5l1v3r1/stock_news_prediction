Excellence, then is not an act but a habit.\" In other words, the little things add up.\nTake the initiative to modify and upgrade your habits. You will increase your productivity, smooth out your work process, and keep yourself motivated with these eight workplace hacks.\n1. Email smarter Make it a habit to enter the recipient address last . That way, you won't be tempted to send an important work email before you've given it a complete look over.\nAlso, Gmail allows you to delay your email after you've hit the \"send\" button – it will simply wait for your chosen duration of time before delivering your message. This can be a real lifesaver if you are in a rush or write something uncharacteristic in the heat of the moment.\n2. Rest your eyes Follow the simple 20-20-20 rule to reduce the eye strain that results from staring at a computer screen. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break and look at some thing 20 feet away. Not only will you be giving your eyes some much deserved rest and reducing the chance of a headache, but you'll be giving yourself a few moments to refresh your mind.\nshow chapters 3 email tips that can boost your chances of getting a response 5:31 PM ET Mon, 11 Sept 2017 | 01:19 3. Maintain a clear workspace The Journal of Neuroscience published a 2011 study that found that multiple stimuli are taxing for your brain. While some studies have defended messy desks as inspiration for creativity , our desks are often just filled with things that are obsolete or inessential to our current work.\nRevisit your filing system and let your desk be a reflection of your mind: clear and focused.\n4. Stock up on healthy snacks Fruits, nuts, and energy bars are just a few healthy snacks that you can turn to when you find your energy level dropping or mood darkening. Take a few options into the office at the beginning of the week.\nFurthermore, if you're a business owner, take note of a study that found that work happiness shot up 10 percent when complimentary snacks were included, though only a small percentage of workers actually took advantage of the perk.\n5. Delegate Productivity is not always a solo mission. The more tasks you've intelligently delegated , the better off you'll be.\nDon't do a specific job simply because you're the only one who knows how to do it. If you can teach someone else or even delegate that teaching, you'll be helping yourself and your team in the long run. You'll also be freeing yourself to take on new, less familiar challenges.\n6. Be comfortable Cushions for back support, wrist rests and any number of ergonomic products (chairs, keyboards, mice) are huge helps in the office. This is not a category in which to cut corners, whether it's for you or your employees.

Ask questions It's often impossible to solve problems without asking the right questions . These can be questions you ask someone you trust, an expert in a specific field or simply yourself. Start your workday off with a little self-inquiry. \"What can I accomplish today that will have the biggest impact on my business?\" \"Who can I talk to today to help overcome the obstacle at hand?\"\nGood questions prepare your mind have a clear intent and a resourceful outlook.\n8. Know your colors The intersection of psychology and the workplace has led to many fascinating discoveries. Sally Augustin , Ph.D., is an environmental scientist with a specialization in color theory. Though we all have personal associations with color, most people relate colors to certain specific qualities. For instance, we usually associate green with growth and creativity, while orange makes us assume good value (with Home Depot as a prime example).\nConsider having your office painted to positively influence your employees' mentalities and moods or use color in your own desk or office to give yourself some inspiration.\nSummary Bringing positive intent into your workplace can make all the difference. Make your office a place that you and others look forward to being in and cultivate smart habits.
