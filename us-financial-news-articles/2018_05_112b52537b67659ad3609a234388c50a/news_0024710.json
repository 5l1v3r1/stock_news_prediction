I’m looking forward already to start the next tournament. There is no pressure. I feel like it’s an opportunity to play my best tennis.\n“Maybe I didn’t play my best game, but maybe she didn’t let me play my best game. She was really good today.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman,; Editing by Toby Davis and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T01:40:37.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
