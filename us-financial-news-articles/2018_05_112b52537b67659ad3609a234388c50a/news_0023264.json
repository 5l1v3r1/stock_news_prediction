A spokeswoman at Volvo Cars said an IPO is an alternative and the decision is up to the owner. She gave no other comments.\nSpokespeople for Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Geely was not immediately available for comment.\nThe source said the three investment banks at this stage were joint co-managers and that no lead bank had yet been appointed.\nVolvo Cars had revenues of 210.9 billion crowns ($24.4 billion) in 2017 with an operating profit of 14.1 billion crowns.
