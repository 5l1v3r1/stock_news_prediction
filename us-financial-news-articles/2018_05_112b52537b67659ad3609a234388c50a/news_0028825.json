(Nasdaq: FVE) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nSenior living revenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 2.8% to $274.5 million from $282.4 million for the same period in 2017, primarily due to the sale of two senior living communities during the fourth quarter of 2017 and two communities during the first quarter of 2018 pursuant to a transaction agreement Five Star entered with Senior Housing Properties Trust (Nasdaq: SNH), or the 2017 Transaction Agreement, and a decrease in occupancy, partially offset by an increase in average monthly rates to residents who pay privately for services. Management fee revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased 1.7% to $3.6 million, primarily due to an increase in the number of managed communities compared to the same period in 2017. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $6.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 included a gain on sale of senior living communities of $5.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in connection with the sale of two senior living communities in January and February 2018 pursuant to the 2017 Transaction Agreement. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.7 million compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2017. EBITDA excluding certain items noted in the supplemental information provided below, or Adjusted EBITDA, was $(3.7) million and $3.8 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. A reconciliation of net loss determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 appears later in this press release.\nOperating Results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nOccupancy at owned and leased senior living communities for the first quarter of 2018 was 81.7% compared to 83.6% for the same period in 2017. The average monthly rate at owned and leased senior living communities for the first quarter of 2018 increased 0.8% to $4,796 from $4,756 for the same period in 2017. The percentage of revenue derived from residents’ private resources at owned and leased senior living communities for the first quarter of 2018 was 77.3% compared to 77.6% for the same period in 2017.\nOther:\nAs previously disclosed, in November 2017, Five Star agreed to sell six senior living communities to SNH pursuant to the 2017 Transaction Agreement for an aggregate sales price of $104.4 million, including $2.4 million of mortgage debt principal that Five Star prepaid in December 2017 in connection with the sale of one of these communities, SNH's assumption of approximately $33.5 million of mortgage debt principal secured by certain of these senior living communities and excluding closing costs. In December 2017, Five Star sold two of these communities for an aggregate sales price of approximately $39.2 million, excluding closing costs. In January 2018, Five Star sold one of these communities for approximately $19.7 million, excluding closing costs. In February 2018, Five Star sold one of these communities for approximately $22.2 million, including SNH’s assumption of approximately $16.8 million of mortgage debt principal and excluding closing costs. In connection with these sales, Five Star entered management and pooling agreements with SNH to manage these senior living communities, and Five Star expects to enter additional management and pooling arrangements with SNH concurrent with the sales of the remaining two communities. The closings of the sales of the remaining two communities for an aggregate sales price of approximately $23.3 million, including SNH’s assumption of approximately $16.7 million of mortgage debt principal, are expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of 2018 as third party approvals are received.\nIn March 2018, Five Star and SNH agreed to sell one skilled nursing facility owned by SNH for a sales price of approximately $6.5 million, excluding closing costs. Five Star expects the closing of the sale of this skilled nursing facility to occur by the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nConference Call:\nAt 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time this morning, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bruce Mackey, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Richard Doyle, and Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Scott Herzig will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.\nThe conference call telephone number is (877) 329-4332.

accordance with GAAP. Five Star believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table below are meaningful supplemental disclosures because they may help investors gain a better understanding of changes in Five Star’s operating results and its ability to pay rent or service debt, make capital expenditures and expand its business. These non-GAAP financial measures also may help investors make comparisons between Five Star and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Five Star believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful financial measures that may help investors better understand its financial performance, including by allowing investors to compare Five Star’s performance between periods and to the performance of other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by management to evaluate Five Star’s financial performance and compare Five Star’s performance over time and to the performance of other companies. Five Star calculates EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as shown below. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), as indicators of Five Star’s operating performance or as measures of Five Star’s liquidity. Also, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts calculated by other companies.\nFive Star believes that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure, determined according to GAAP, to Five Star’s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The following table presents the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss $ (7,949 ) $ (6,787 ) Add: interest and other expense 703 978 Add: provision for income taxes 256 91 Add: depreciation and amortization expense 8,860 9,486 Less: interest, dividend and other income (167 ) (184 ) EBITDA 1,703 3,584 Add (less): Long lived asset impairment — 210 Costs related to compliance assessment (138 ) — Employee litigation matter 381 — Gain on sale of senior living communities (5,684 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ (3,738 ) $ 3,794 FIVE STAR SENIOR LIVING INC.\nSENIOR LIVING COMMUNITY FINANCIAL DATA (1)\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Senior living revenue: Independent and assisted living community revenue (owned) $ 19,718 $ 23,704 Independent and assisted living community revenue (leased) 107,294 108,209 Continuing care retirement community revenue (leased) 97,778 99,182 Skilled nursing facility revenue (leased) 41,085 43,738 Ageility physical therapy revenue 8,650 7,598 Total senior living revenue $ 274,525 $ 282,431 Senior living wages and benefits: Independent and assisted living community wages and benefits (owned) $ 8,382 $ 9,880 Independent and assisted living community wages and benefits (leased) 46,450 46,769 Continuing care retirement community wages and benefits (leased) 49,942 50,484 Skilled nursing facility wages and benefits (leased) 26,806 27,954 Ageility physical therapy wages and benefits 5,674 5,115 Insurance and other (2) (1,085 ) (1,890 ) Total senior living wages and benefits $ 136,169 $ 138,312 Other senior living operating expenses: Independent and assisted living community other operating expenses (owned) $ 5,676 $ 6,407 Independent and assisted living community other operating expenses (leased) 28,208 27,080 Continuing care retirement community other operating expenses (leased) 26,439 26,066 Skilled nursing facility other operating expenses (leased) 12,972 11,916 Ageility physical therapy other operating expenses 466 392 Insurance and other (2) 16 1,426 Total senior living operating expenses $ 73,777 $ 73,287 (1) Excludes data for managed communities.\n(2) Insurance and other expenses primarily relate to Five Star's captive insurance company subsidiary, which mainly participates in Five Star's workers' compensation and professional and general liability insurance programs.
