As of January 1, 2018 for the first time in several years, the Company did not have any closing campus operations, which would otherwise have been reported under the Transitional segment. GAAP results include Transitional segment results for the comparable period of 2017.\nFIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS:\nExcluding the Transitional segment, which includes closed campuses, student starts increased by 2.2%. Both the Transportation and Skilled Trades segment and Healthcare and Other Professions (“HOPS”) segment starts exceeded the prior year. Total revenue for the first quarter was $61.9 million compared to $65.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Excluding the Transitional segment from the prior year, revenue would have increased by 1.5%, or $0.9 million. Educational services and facilities expense decreased by $2.2 million, or 6.8%, to $30.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $32.7 million in the prior year comparable period. The expense reductions were due to a $2.7 million decrease relating to the Transitional segment, partially offset by (a) increased facilities expense of $0.3 million mainly resulting from higher winter-related common area maintenance charges and utilities expense, and (b) higher books and tools expense of $0.3 million relating to laptops issued to new students for a growing number of our program offerings. Selling general and administrative expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 2.1%, to $37.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $38.3 million in the prior year comparable period. The cost reductions were due to a $2.1 million decrease related to the Transitional segment, partially offset by (a) higher marketing investments of $1.1 million directed at future start growth, and (b) higher administrative expenses of $0.5 million. Net interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by $4.6 million, or 89.1% to $0.6 million from $5.2 million in the prior year comparable period primarily as a result of the new credit facility of a previous term loan (and the associated fees and expenses resulting from the termination), which occurred on March 31, 2017. As a result of the termination the Company anticipates savings of approximately $5 million for the year. Net loss for the quarter was $6.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to a net loss of $10.9 million, or $0.46 per share, in the prior year comparable quarter.\n“We’ve had a solid start to 2018,” said Scott Shaw, President & CEO. “On a same school basis, we generated 1.5% revenue growth and student start growth of 2.2%. We’ve also continued to expand our corporate partnerships during 2018 with the addition of Hussman, Johnson Controls and today we are announcing our first partnership with Bridgestone Retail Operations. We believe that this demonstrates that major corporations in industries serviced by our graduates are increasingly turning to Lincoln to fill a critical need for trained employees due to our track record for preparing our students for careers in dynamic industries.”\n“We are also pursuing program expansion plans where our resources allow us to do so and our financial performance is benefitting from the lower interest expense of the credit facility entered into a year ago, as well as the cost reductions resulting from campus closures as of December 31, 2017. The results we have reported today are ahead of our internal plan for the first quarter and are enabling us to reiterate our guidance for 2018, which we first provided in late February.”\nFIRST QUARTER SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reclassified the Marietta, Georgia campus from the Healthcare and Other Professions segment, to the Transportation and Skilled Trades segment. The change was made as the majority of the student concentration is currently enrolled in skilled trades programs. This change is deemed appropriate and in line with our segment structure. Prior year numbers have been recast to reflect the change for comparability.\nTransportation and Skilled Trades\nThe Transportation and Skilled Trades segment revenue decreased to $42.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $43.2 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease in revenue was a result of a 2.2% decrease in average population driven by a lower carry in population of approximately 300 students. Partially offsetting the reduction is a 1.3% increase in average revenue per student.\nStudent starts for the quarter increased slightly compared to the prior year comparable period.\nOperating income was $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.9 million in the prior year comparable period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 2.8%, to $21.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $20.8 million in the prior year comparable period due to $0.5 million of additional marketing investments directed at further increasing future start growth.\nHealthcare and Other Professions\nThe HOPS segment revenue increased by $1.3 million, or 7.3% to $19.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $17.8 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase in revenue was the result of a 4.6% increase in average student population driven by an increased carry in population of approximately 150 students and a 2.5% increase in average revenue per student.\nStudent start results increased by 5.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from the prior year comparable period.\nOperating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.2 million compared to $0.3 million in the prior year comparable period.\nSelling general and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million, or 13%, to $9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $8.1 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily driven by two factors, (a) a $0.6 million increase in marketing investment and (b) a $0.4 million increase in administrative expenses.\nTransitional\nThere were no operations for the Transitional segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as all of the campuses classified in this segment were closed as of December 31, 2017. Revenue and operating loss for the prior year comparable period were $4.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nCorporate and Other\nThis category includes unallocated expenses incurred on behalf of the entire Company. Corporate and other expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 2.6%, to $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $7.4 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease in costs were primarily driven by reductions in salaries and benefits expense of $0.4 million partially offset by a loss on sale of assets of $0.1 million. This loss related to catch-up depreciation expense in connection with a building previously classified as held for sale during 2017 but was reclassified to held for use as of January 1, 2018.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Company is reiterating the guidance provided on February 28, 2018 as follows:\nRevenue is expected to increase by low single digits, compared to prior year, excluding the 2017 Transitional segment. Operating Income for 2018 is expected to be in the range of breakeven and a loss of $3 million. Student starts are expected to increase by low single digits, compared to prior year, excluding the 2017 Transitional segment. Year-end population is expected to be greater than that of the prior year.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFO\nLincoln will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

EBITDA and same school basis revenue are measurements not recognized in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We define EBITDA as income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define same school basis revenue as Total Company revenue less the Transitional segment revenue. EBITDA and same school revenue are presented because we believe they are a useful indicator of our performance and our ability to make strategic acquisitions and meet capital expenditure and debt service requirements. However, it is not intended to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP and should not be used as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and same school basis revenue are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and same school basis revenue:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Unaudited) 2018 2017 Net loss $ (6,874 ) $ (10,929 ) Interest expense, net 562 5,151 Provision for income taxes 50 50 Depreciation and amortization 2,100 2,152 EBITDA $ (4,162 ) $ (3,576 )\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Unaudited) Transportation and Skilled Trades Healthcare and Other Professions 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income $ 675 $ 1,917 $ 243 $ 314 Interest expense, net - (18 ) - - Provision for income taxes - - - - Depreciation and amortization 1,884 1,965 54 1 EBITDA $ 2,559 $ 3,864 $ 297 $ 315 Three Months Ended March 31, (Unaudited) Transitional Corporate 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net loss $ - $ (568 ) $ (7,792 ) $ (12,592 ) Interest expense, net - - 562 5,169 Provision for income taxes - - 50 50 Depreciation and amortization - 27 162 159 EBITDA $ - $ (541 ) $ (7,018 ) $ (7,214 )\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Unaudited) % Change Student Starts Same School Total Company Transitional Segment Same school Basis Basis 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 Student Starts 2,786 2,857 - 132 2,786 2,725 2.2 %\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Unaudited) Total Total % Change Company Company Same School Basis 2018 2017 2018 Total Company Revenue $ 61,889 $ 65,279 Less: Transitional Revenue - (4,275 ) Revenue on Same School Basis $ 61,889 $ 61,004 1.5 %\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Unaudited) 2018 2017 % Change Revenue: Transportation and Skilled Trades $ 42,747 $ 43,159 -1.0 % Healthcare and Other Professions 19,142 17,845 7.3 % Transitional - 4,275 -100.0 % Total $ 61,889 $ 65,279 -5.2 % Operating Income (Loss): Transportation and Skilled Trades $ 676 $ 1,900 -64.4 % Healthcare and Other Professions 244 314 -22.3 % Transitional - (569 ) 100.0 % Corporate (7,181 ) (7,372 ) 2.6 % Total $ (6,261 ) $ (5,727 ) -9.3 % Starts: Transportation and Skilled Trades 1,806 1,796 0.6 % Healthcare and Other Professions 980 929 5.5 % Transitional - 132 -100.0 % Total 2,786 2,857 -2.5 % Average Population: Transportation and Skilled Trades 6,627 6,776 -2.2 % Healthcare and Other Professions 3,586 3,430 4.6 % Transitional - 884 -100.0 % Total 10,214 11,090 -7.9 % End of Period Population: Transportation and Skilled Trades 6,736 6,945 -3.0 % Healthcare and Other Professions 3,748 3,539 5.9 % Transitional - 774 -100.0 % Total 10,484 11,258 -6.9 %\nLINCOLN EDUCATIONAL SERVICES CORPORATION\nBrian Meyers, CFO\n973-736-9340\nEVC GROUP, Inc.\nInvestor Relations: Doug Sherk, dsherk@evcgroup.com ; 415-652-9100\nMedia Relations: Tom Gibson, 201-476-0322\nSource:Lincoln Educational Services Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=03OroMB621cYAtJ74ir5Ax0kZXmLHVOxmnbldARi7cft3_ncaJHKIv8rkkqmiAzl-48bZeiNyrr0hHlJVQcxWMF5sTzZR4_826pKEzRiSsU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0uYuujUZ733kdw_HncjpvgrquCJuFbxspEPEUQuXksZhHtEutEe8M5_C_9YRZb0hy7Bfjpp-xpblcAPTVNlQcquJMDiyopAniFR6UTiQTI8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0uYuujUZ733kdw_HncjpvgrquCJuFbxspEPEUQuXksZyoaxcEDZvvQ_eSwvPTujZEfx_HEfX6Kmnfx2t6yX0rI-hVBzvLBYk1Ow_AAmXQ54="], "published": "2018-05-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T16:21:10.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
