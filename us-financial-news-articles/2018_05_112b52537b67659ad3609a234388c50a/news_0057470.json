It may also be true that not all exchanges implement strict controls to spot and stop this sort of cheating.\nBitcoin, currently at a price of just $7,380 (down 6.4% in the last 24 hours’ trading), almost hit $20,000 late last year. The subsequent tumbles in its price were largely precipitated by crackdowns on exchanges.\nChina took the most drastic steps , first by banning initial coin offerings—a form of fund-raising involving the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens—and then by banning exchanges outright. New exchange regulations in South Korea and Japan also caused drops in Bitcoin’s price.\nThe New York attorney general last month launched an initial probe into the measures that exchanges are taking to protect customers and provide transparency in their operations.
