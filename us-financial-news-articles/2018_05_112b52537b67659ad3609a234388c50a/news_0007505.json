A Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) logo is pictured on a sign in North Miami Beach, Florida, U.S. April 6, 2017. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\nCompetition between restaurants has intensified as Yum, McDonald’s Corp ( MCD.N ) and Domino’s Pizza Inc ( DPZ.N ) pull out all the stops to lure diners with dollar menus, discounts and new breakfast items as consumers increasingly spend less on processed food and eating out.\nYum shares fell 5 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday after results showed sales at restaurants open at least a year rose 1 percent in the three months ended March 31, compared with the 2 percent expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe results also contrasted stronger-than-expected quarterly sales from McDonald’s and Domino’s over the past week, indicating that Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum may have lost market share to rivals.\nSame-restaurant sales at KFC rose 2 percent in the first quarter of 2018, the slowest growth rate in four quarters. The fried chicken outlet’s U.S. same-restaurant sales were unchanged.\nOn a conference call with analysts, Yum executives said KFC would have recorded a 3 percent growth in same-restaurant sales had it not been for supply chain issues in the United Kingdom.\nYum was forced to shut hundreds of British KFC outlets in February due to a shortage of chicken resulting from the abrupt change of a supplier.\nPizza Hut also missed expectations for same-restaurant sales, which rose a lower-than-expected 1 percent worldwide, reflecting a 2 percent decline in overseas markets.\nOverall revenue at Yum fell 3 percent to $1.37 billion but topped estimates of $1.09 billion, thanks to stronger sales at Taco Bell.\nNet income jumped to $433 million from $280 million last year, reflecting gains from the sale of company-owned restaurants to franchisees.\nExcluding one-time items, Yum earned 90 cents per share, ahead of expectations of 68 cents.
