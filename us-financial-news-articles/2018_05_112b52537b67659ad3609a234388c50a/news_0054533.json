Consensus finds no major signs of accelerating inflation; wage improvements aren’t broad; drivers of the (workforce) participation rate are still a mystery and the flatter yield curve isn’t flashing red yet,” Citi analysts said in a note.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.21 percent to 24,886.81, the S&P 500 gained 0.32 percent to 2,733.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 7,425.96.\nThe two-year treasury note yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5282 percent.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell back below the 3-percent threshold to 2.999 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 3.003 percent on Wednesday.\nAustralian shares were 0.1 percent lower, extending losses into a sixth consecutive session on weak prices for iron ore and oil. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was 0.4 percent higher.\nU.S. crude was flat at $71.83 a barrel. Oil prices fell on Wednesday after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories.\nBrent futures stood at $79.80 a barrel. Last week, the global benchmark rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\nThe most-traded iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange closed 0.7 percent lower on Wednesday.\nThe dollar was down 0.25 percent against the yen to 109.78 .\nThe euro was up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1706. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.1 percent lower at 93.894.\nEmerging market currencies are in the spotlight after Turkey’s central bank raised interest rates by 300 basis points to support a plunging lira.\nThe bank, which had been scheduled to hold its next policy-setting meeting on June 7, said it had increased its top interest rate to 16.5 percent from 13.5 percent.\nThe lira has fallen about 20 percent so far this year to a series of record lows, but the currency reversed course after the central bank decision. It was last down 0.2 percent at 4.5790 to the dollar.\nGold was slightly higher. Spot gold was traded at $1295.51 per ounce.\nReporting by Andrew Galbraith Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:29:53.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
