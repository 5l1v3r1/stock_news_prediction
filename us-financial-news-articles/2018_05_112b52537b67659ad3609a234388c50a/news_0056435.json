(AP) â€” The bidding for a private lunch with investor Warren Buffett begins at the relative bargain of $25,000, but by the end of the week the price is likely to top $2 million again.\nThe high price people are willing to pay for time with Buffett benefits the Glide Foundation, which helps the homeless in San Francisco.\nBuffett has raised over $26 million for the Glide Foundation through these annual auctions over the past 18 years.\nSince 2010, the auction has only finished below $2 million once.\nBuffett's first wife, Susie introduced him to Glide after she volunteered there. She died in 2004, but the connection endured.\nThis year's eBay auction begins Sunday evening and runs through 9:30 p.m. Central on Friday. The winner can invite up to seven friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T00:54:07.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
