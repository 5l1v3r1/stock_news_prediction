Gulen has denied involvement.\nIn a separate operation, an Ankara prosecutor on Thursday issued detention warrants for 93 employees of a private tutoring center that was previously closed down on suspicion of links to Gulen’s network, Anadolu said.\nTurkish authorities have detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants since the failed military intervention, the U.N. human rights office said in March.\nAmong those detained, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during their trials.\nTurkey’s Western allies have criticized the crackdown. Critics of President Tayyip Erdogan accuse him of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.\nReporting by Daren Butler and Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Ece Toksabay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T11:07:43.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
