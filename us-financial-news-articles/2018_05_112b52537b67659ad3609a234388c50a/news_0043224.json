NEW SOUTH WALES WARATAHS 41 OTAGO HIGHLANDERS 12\nThe Waratahs held their collective nerve to end nearly two years and 40 matches of New Zealand Super Rugby dominance over Australia with a bonus point victory over the short-handed Highlanders on Saturday.\nThe Highlanders were always up against it after winger Tevita Nabura had been sent off in the 19th minute for kicking Cam Clark in the face, and the visitors had to play with 13 men for 10 minutes in the first half.\nThe Waratahs, who gave up a 29-0 lead to lose last week, initially made heavy work of it but a brace apiece from Taqele Naiyaravoro and Israel Folau along with tries from Lalakai Foketi and Curtis Rona were enough to snap the streak.\nNo Australian side had beaten New Zealand opposition in Super Rugby since the Waratahs thrashed the Waikato Chiefs 45-25 on May 27, 2016, a miserable run that sparked a crisis of confidence in the game on the western shore of the Tasman Sea. AUCKLAND BLUES 24 CANTERBURY CRUSADERS 32\nThe reigning champions marched back to the top of the Super Rugby standings by building up a big first-half lead before holding off a second-half fightback by the struggling Blues at a rain-drenched Eden Park.\nWinger George Bridge, lock Quinten Strange and flanker Matt Todd crossed to help the Crusaders to a 29-12 halftime lead with scrumhalf Bryn Hall adding the fourth try after the break and Richie Mo’unga notching two penalties and three conversions.\nAll Blacks winger Rieko Ioane scored two tries and made one each for fullback Matt Duffie and replacement Michael Collins but the Blues were always chasing the game.\nAn eighth straight victory sent the Crusaders a point clear of the Wellington Hurricanes at the top of the competition standings ahead of their clash in Christchurch next week. SUNWOLVES 26 STORMERS 23\nFlyhalf Hayden Parker nailed a drop goal nearly four minutes after the hooter to give the Sunwolves back-to-back victories for the first time as Super Rugby made its Hong Kong debut with a Mong Kok Stadium thriller on Saturday.\nThe Sunwolves grabbed their first win of the season with a 63-28 thrashing of the Queensland Reds at home in Tokyo last weekend but this was a much tighter affair against the Cape Town-based Stormers.\nTwo tries from livewire winger Dillyn Leyds and an intercept score from JJ Engelbrecht helped the South Africans to a 17-10 halftime lead with Parker having scored all his side’s points through a converted try and a penalty.\nSunwolves lock Grant Hattingh crossed at the end of a sweeping move to lock up the scores after the break and Parker added his second penalty to put his side 20-17 ahead with 17 minutes to play.\nStormers fullback SP Marais landed two huge penalties, the second from five metres inside his own half, to edge the visitors back ahead, though, before the unerring Parker nailed his third three-pointer to set up the dramatic finale. WELLINGTON HURRICANES 38 QUEENSLAND REDS 34\nThe Hurricanes struggled to get their high octane attack going but still had just enough to overcome an obdurate Reds side on Friday, outscoring the visitors five tries to four to notch up their 10th straight Super Rugby victory.\nWinger Ben Lam nabbed his 13th and 14th tries of the campaign and there were also scores from number eight Blade Thomson, lock Sam Lousi and flyhalf Beauden Barrett, who added 13 points with the boot.\nTries from winger Filipo Daugunu and prop Taniela Tupou helped the Reds to a 20-14 lead after 26 minutes with the other winger, Jordan Petaia, and centre Samu Kerevi crossing after the break to keep them in the match for the full 80 minutes.\nThe win put the Hurricanes back on top of the standings by three points pending the Canterbury Crusaders’ match on Saturday and extends New Zealand’s Super Rugby hegemony over Australia to 40 matches.
