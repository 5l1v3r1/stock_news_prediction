Siniscalco is an ex-economy minister who served under former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.\nThe 5-Star Movement and League were near to a deal on Monday to form a coalition, though they had not announced their choice for prime minister. The parties are due to hold pivotal talks with the country’s president in the afternoon.\nReporting by Luca Trogni, writing by Steve Scherer in Rome\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:14:44.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
