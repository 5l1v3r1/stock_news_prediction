The 22 branches to be closed or consolidated into existing locations are incremental to branch consolidations already planned in relation to the acquisition of Gibraltar Private Bank and Trust. Since the end of 2014, the Company has opened or acquired 81 branches and closed or consolidated 53 branch locations, excluding those disclosed today. Following these actions, the Company will operate in 296 locations across the Southeast region.\nDaryl G. Byrd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"These closures are intended to optimize our branch and ATM network as part of on-going efforts to improve the efficiency of our franchise. As our clients increasingly use and become more reliant on our digital channels, we continuously review our distribution channels to ensure we are operating efficiently.\" Byrd continued, \"We are committed to providing extraordinary service to our clients and communities, and investing in banking solutions that meet their evolving preferences.\"\nThe closures are anticipated to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2018 and provide an improvement to annual run-rate operating expense by over $8 million on a pre-tax basis once sold or closed. The Company expects to realize an incremental $2 million reduction in non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2018. Total expenses associated with the branch closures are anticipated to be approximately $12 million in non-core charges, of which $7 million is expected to be recognized in the second quarter and $5 million in the third quarter of 2018. The total cost of the branch consolidations is expected to be earned back through non-interest expense reductions within a two-year period.\nIBERIABANK Corporation\nIBERIABANK Corporation is a regional financial holding company with offices in Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Texas, Florida, Georgia, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina, offering commercial, private banking, consumer, small business, wealth and trust management, retail brokerage, mortgage, and title insurance services.\nThe Company's common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"IBKC\".
