But Australian stocks bucked the trend and advanced 0.4 percent.\nCURRENCIES The strong U.S. data underpinned the dollar in currency markets.\nThe US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, hits a 2018 high of 93.46 on Tuesday and last stood at 93.31.\nThe euro fell to as low as $1.18155, its lowest level in about five months.\nThe dollar held firm at 110.27 yen after having hit a near four-month high of 110.45 yen on Tuesday.\nThe yen largely shrugged off data that showed Japan’s economy shrank by 0.6 percent on an annualised basis in the January-March quarter, a sharper contraction than the median estimate of 0.2 percent and marking the end to eight straight quarters of expansion.\n“U.S. retail data assured that the world is still in a synchronised global growth. If U.S. retail had been a disappointment, the market would have taken Japan’s GDP more negatively,” said Tohru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities.\nHigh-yielding Asian currencies were particularly vulnerable to higher U.S. yields, which could prompt investors to shift funds out of emerging markets.\nThe Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year lows while the Malaysian ringgit hit a four-month low.\nThe South Korean won was steadier but the country’s bond yields rose to the highest level since late 2014.\nIn commodities markets, gold slightly rebounded after hitting a 4 1/2-month low the previous day on a strong dollar.\nIt stood at $1,294 per ounce, off Tuesday’s low of $1,289.30.\nCrude oil prices remained near recent highs amid concerns U.S. sanctions on Iran may restrict crude exports from a major producer.\nU.S. light crude was 0.4 percent lower at $71.06 after reaching $71.92 on Tuesday, its highest level since November 2014.\nBrent crude oil traded at $78.21 a barrel, down 0.3 percent. On Tuesday, it reached an intraday peak of $79.47 a barrel, its highest since November 2014.\nReporting by Andrew Galbraith, additional reporting by Swati Pandey in SYDNEY; Editing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:38:19.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
