He owned BHS for 15 years before he sold the loss-making retailer to Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no retail experience, for one pound in 2015.\nIn February last year Green paid 363 million pounds to plug a hole in BHS’s pension schemes. However, some lawmakers still want Green to be stripped of his knighthood, awarded in 2006 for services to retail.\n“The retail environment remains highly competitive and challenging,” said Taveta chief executive Ian Grabiner.\n“Whilst we have found headline sales and profits disappointing, we remain a strongly cash generative business and had a positive net cash balance at the year end of 157.2 million pounds.” ($1 = 0.7404 pounds) (Reporting by James Davey Editing by Alexandra Hudson)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
