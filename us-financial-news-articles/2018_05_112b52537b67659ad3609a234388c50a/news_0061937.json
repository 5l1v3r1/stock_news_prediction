Net loss from discontinued operations for the 2017 Fiscal Year was $(2,557,034) or $(0.91) per share [$(0.91) fully diluted] versus a net loss of $(5,795,744) or $(2.05) per share the prior year.\nThese losses primarily arose from the discontinuance of the Company’s legacy beverage operations, hot-fill co-packing business, and disposition of its plant equipment.\nThe Company is continuing to pursue its arrangement agreement with Liquid Media Group, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Net loss before stock based compensation (“SBC”) is determined as follows:\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nNet loss from continuing operations $(830,115) $(713,945) Add back SBC - - Net loss before SBC $ (830,115 ) $ (713,945 ) Non-GAAP Net loss per share before SBC is determined as follows:\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nNet loss per share from continuing operations $(0.30) $(0.25) Add back SBC per share - - Net loss per share before SBC $ (0.30 ) $ (0.25 ) Pro-forma results for EBITDAS, as defined below, are determined as follows:\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nNet loss from continuing operations $(830,115) $(713,945) Add back: Interest, net - - Depreciation and Amortization 1,053 1,053 Non-cash stock based compensation - - Non-cash income tax expense - - Total Add Backs 1,053 1,053 EBITDAS $ (829,062 ) $ (712,892 )\nEBITDAS per share reconciles to earnings per share as follows:\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nNet loss per share from continuing operations $(0.30) $(0.25) Add back: Interest - - Depreciation and Amortization 0.00 0.00 Non-cash stock based compensation - - Non-cash income tax expense (recovery) - - EBITDAS per share $ (0.30 ) $ (0.25 ) As at February 28, 2018 the Company had free cash of $786,340 as well as restricted cash of $583,012.\nAs at February 28, 2018 the Company had outstanding 2,802,412 common shares.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAny non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nEBITDAS is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDAS is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. EBITDAS should not be construed as a substitute for net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing operating performance, as EBITDAS is not defined by GAAP. However, the Company regards EBITDAS as a complement to net income and income before taxes.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain information contained in this press release includes forward-looking statements.
