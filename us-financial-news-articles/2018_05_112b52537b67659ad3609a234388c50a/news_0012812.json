Pollock had two hits and John Ryan Murphy had a two-out, run scoring single in the ninth inning as the Diamondbacks (21-9) remained tied for the best start in franchise history despite the loss, their second in seven games.\nRyu came up limping after his first pitch to Deven Marrero in the second inning and was replaced by Pedro Baez. Ryu entered the game with a 3-0 record, a 2.22 ERA and a .152 batting average against.\nBaez pitched a career-high 2 2/3 innings, Daniel Hudson (1-0) retired all six batters he faced for the win, and Kenley Jansen gave up one run before stranding the tying run at second for his fourth save.\nThe Diamondbacks threatened in the eighth, when David Peralta doubled and took third on a flyout, and Paul Goldschmidt walked with one out. Dodgers shortstop Enrique Hernandez backhanded a sharp one-hopper by Pollock to start an inning-ending double play. Pollock had four homers in the first two games of the series.\nVerdugo doubled with one out in the first inning and scored on Bellinger’s single after Yasmani Grandal walked.\nVerdugo doubled with one out in the eighth inning, took third on a wild pitch and scored on Grandal’s sacrifice fly for a 2-0 lead.\nArizona right-hander Zack Godley (4-2) gave up five hits and one run in six innings, with five strikeouts and three walks. Godley benefitted from inning-ending double plays in the first, fifth and sixth innings.\nThe Dodgers loaded the bases with one out in the fifth inning before Verdugo grounded into a double play, and Matt Kemp hit into double plays in the first and the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:02:56.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
