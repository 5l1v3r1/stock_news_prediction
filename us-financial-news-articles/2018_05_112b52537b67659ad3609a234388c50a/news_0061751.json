The anti-immigration stance was popular with voters in rural Hungary.\nHe has accused Soros and the NGOs funded by him of a plot to undermine Hungary’s Christian culture by flooding it with immigrants, an allegation which Soros has repeatedly denied.\n“This is a legal framework and it will be up to the courts to decide how they will qualify certain activities,” Domotor said.\nOrban risks triggering a crisis in his Fidesz party’s relationship with the EU’s centre-right parties over laws they charge infringe civil liberties, an ally of Germany’ chancellor warned on Monday.
