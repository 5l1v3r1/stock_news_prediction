Two bottles, of three vintage bottles of vin jaune \"yellow wine\" from 1774, are presented in a cellar in Arbois, France, May 22, 2018 before the three bottles are put up for auction in Lons le Saunier on May 26th. REUTERS/Jean-Pierre Amet\nThe bottles of Arbois Vin Jaune, among the oldest wines in the world, are estimated at 15,000 euros - 20,000 euros ($17,000 -$23,000) each, according to auction house Jura Encheres, which will conduct the sale in the eastern town of Lons-le-Saunier.\nAuctioneer Philippe Etievant said a group of experts in 1994 tasted a bottle of the 1774 wine and scored it 9.4 out of 10. In 2011, a similar bottle sold for 57,000 euros at auction.\nThe wine is still made in the Jura region.
