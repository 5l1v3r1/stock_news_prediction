They targeted allies of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity.” (Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh and Elena Fabrichnaya; Editing by Jon Boyle)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T12:32:27.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
