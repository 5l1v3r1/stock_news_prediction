Going forward, we expect the sector to witness better loan growth post summer as well, benefiting from the substantial base of non-interest bearing deposits in this context of higher interest rates.”\nIn Abu Dhabi, telecommunications firm Etisalat rose 2.2 percent, helping the stock index to close 0.5 percent higher.\nInvestors saw a bargain in the stock after it lagged the index this year on concerns over earnings growth. It reported a flat first quarter net profit last month amid higher expenses and impairments. The stock is still down 6.6 percent so far this year.\nDana Gas dropped 2.8 percent, giving up much of its gains a day earlier when it surged 3.9 percent after announcing that it had struck a deal with creditors on restructuring $700 million of sukuk. This will possibly bring to an end a nearly year-long legal row that spooked investors in Islamic finance.\nIn Dubai, the index closed 0.5 percent up, helped by Emaar Properties which rose 1.2 percent. Larger gains were prevented by profit-taking in lender Emirates NBD which closed almost 2 percent lower.\nDespite Monday’s losses, Emirates NBD is up 22 percent so far this year, outperforming a weak stock market that has been weighed down by property stocks.\nSAUDI ARABIA * The index rose 0.6 percent to 8,071 points.\nDUBAI * The index rose 0.5 percent to 2,905 points.\nABU DHABI * The index rose 0.5 percent to 4,447 points.\nQATAR * The index climbed 1.3 percent to 8,934 points.\nKUWAIT * The index fell 0.5 percent to 4,765 points.\nBAHRAIN * The index was flat at 1,272 points.\nOMAN * The index was flat at 4,690 points.\nEGYPT * The index fell 1.2 percent to 16,984 points.
