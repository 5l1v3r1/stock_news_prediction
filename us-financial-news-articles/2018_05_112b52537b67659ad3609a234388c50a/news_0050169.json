The Brooklyn Democrat says restaurants should replace plastic with paper or metal straws.\nExceptions would be made for people with disabilities or medical conditions. Penalties would be a $100 fine.\nThe move comes as cities and nations begin to tackle the growing problem of plastic pollution.\nEspinal says 500 million plastic straws are discarded each day in the U.S. and that up to 12 million metric tons of plastic end up in the oceans each year.\nMalibu, California is banning all plastic cutlery and straws. Seattle and Miami Beach have also enacted bans on plastic straws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:33:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
