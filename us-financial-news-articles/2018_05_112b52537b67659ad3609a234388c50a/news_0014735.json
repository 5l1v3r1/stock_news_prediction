Looking forward, we expect to continue our strong momentum in driving top line growth and continue to gain more market share in the premium segment while maintaining stable profitability.\"\nCustomer Satisfaction:\n\"As the most recognized premium education brand in China, OneSmart aims to offer best-in-class teaching quality and comprehensive customized services to its students and their parents, which is the foundation to our success.\nIn December 2017, we launched iOneSmart Study Master version 10.0 applications to incorporate the latest application of Adaptive Learning Through Socialization (ALTS) and data analytic technology to fine-tune our personalized aptitude assessment, personalized teaching plan and visualized learning progress reports. We upgraded approximately 20% of our OneSmart VIP and HappyMath classrooms with up-to-date hardware and software during the second fiscal quarter of 2018. Out of the 21,833 parents of our OneSmart VIP program who responded to our first half fiscal year 2018 semi-annual parents' satisfaction survey, 91.2% of parents expressed that they are satisfied about our teaching services, and 73.5% of the parents confirmed that their children made good progress while attending our program. We generated over 56% of our cash revenues from renewal and referral of existing OneSmart VIP and HappyMath customers during the second fiscal quarter of 2018.\"\nProfitable Growth:\n\"We aim for faster top-line growth while maintaining solid profit growth.\nWe added three more subjects, Chinese, science, and computer programming, into HappyMath's program and total student enrollments for the Chinese subject reached to approximately 3,000 during the second fiscal quarter of 2018. Revenues from one-on-three premium K-12 tutoring program as a percentage of total revenue increased to 16.4% from 12.1% in the same period of fiscal year 2017. We deliberately opened more learning centers in those top cities that we operate to achieve higher operation efficiency and we are very selective in entering into new cities with great potential. New study centers opened in mature markets (Shanghai) and sub-mature markets (Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing and Beijing) accounted for over 80% of total new study centers we opened during the second fiscal quarter of 2018. We continued to roll out our success in Shanghai to more cities we operate. During the second fiscal quarter of 2018, our study centers in 10 key second tier cities achieved student enrollments growth of more than 50% year-over-year, including Chengdu, Suzhou, Xiamen, Chongqing, Changsha, Kunming, Fuzhou, Shenyang, Dalian and Tianjin.\"\nDiversification:\n\"OneSmart aims to build up a one-stop shopping platform that can provide best-in-class K-12 premium education services for affluent and mass-affluent families in China.\nIn January 2018, we successfully acquired the controlling stake of FasTrack English, a leading English tutor in East China for children aged 3 to 10. We prepared to launch OneSmart Class and OneSmart Online programs in the coming summer\".\nMr. Dong Li, OneSmart's Chief Financial Officer added, \"We successfully improved our operating profit margin by 330 bps year-over-year during the second fiscal quarter of 2018 despite the fact that we opened more study centers and expanded our classroom capacity by 24.9% year-over-year. Leveraging our strong brand influence, excellent teaching and service quality, and superior delicacy management capabilities, we expect to continue improve our operation efficiency and to attract new students, word-of-mouth referrals, and cross-selling of additional subjects and services to existing students in a more effective way, which will lead to lower customer acquisition costs and higher student life-time revenue contributions as they progress through their educational lifecycle with us.\"\n\"OneSmart will continue to invest in talent recruitment and training, research and curriculum development, and to integrate the latest technology to strengthen the teaching and services capabilities and to enhance the overall learning experience of our students. We are confident that our clear growth strategy and increasingly diversified business portfolio ideally positions OneSmart in a broader market to deliver more sustainable revenue and profitability growth for our shareholders in the long-run.\"\nFinancial Results For the Second Fiscal Quarter Ended February 28, 2018\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues were RMB663.5 million (US$104.8 million), an increase of 34.1% from RMB494.6 million during the same period last year.

All information provided in this press release is current as of the date of the press release, and OneSmart does not undertake any obligation to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating its business, OneSmart considers and uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC as supplemental metrics to review and assess its operating performance: non-GAAP operating costs and expenses, non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income attributable to OneSmart. To present each of these non-GAAP measures, the Company excludes share-based compensation expenses. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures\" set forth at the end of this release.\nOneSmart believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective.

These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to OneSmart's historical performance and liquidity. OneSmart computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and from period to period. OneSmart believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using non-GAAP measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charges that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the Company's business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nFor more information, please contact:\nOneSmart\nMs. Rebecca Shen\nPhone: +86-21-5255-9339 ext. 8139\nE-mail: ir@onesmart.org\nChristensen\nIn China\nMr. Christian Arnell\nPhone: +86-10-5826-4939\nE-mail: carnell@christensenir.com\nIn the US\nMs. Linda Bergkamp\nPhone: +1-480-614-3004\nEmail: lbergkamp@ChristensenIR.com\n[1] \"Enrollments\", for the purpose of calculation, are to a student who takes at least one class for one subject in a certain period is treated as one enrollment in the same period.
