So I’m not going to get excited one way or the other,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\nAt 12:53 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 47.55 points, or 0.19 percent, at 24,787.08, the S&P 500 was up 0.82 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,723.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 18.02 points, or 0.24 percent, at 7,386.95.\nThe Dow edged above 100-day moving average for the first time since April 18, following the S&P&rsquo;s similar move a day earlier, suggesting that the market may move higher.\n“Stock market is the best predictor of economic activity. It’s natural that we have volatility, modest corrections, but the upward trend is still going to be intact,” said Tom Plumb, president and chief investment officer of Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.\nBoosting the Dow was Verizon, which rose 3.2 percent after JPMorgan upgraded the wireless carrier to “overweight”, saying 5G opportunity will start to crystallize in the next few months.\nSymantec slumped 33.6 percent after the Norton Antivirus maker said it was investigating concerns raised by a former employee.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.15-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.08-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 28 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 116 new highs and 44 new lows.
