(Nasdaq:LOCO) today announced financial results for the 13-week period ended March 28, 2018.\nHighlights for the first quarter ended March 28, 2018, compared to the first quarter ended March 29, 2017 were as follows:\nTotal revenue, excluding franchise advertising fee revenue, increased 0.9% to $100.7 million compared to $99.8 million in the same period of 2017. Including $5.1 million of franchise advertising fee revenue related to franchise advertising fund contributions, required as part of new accounting guidance implementation, total revenue increased 6.0% to $105.8 million. System-wide comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.1%, including a 2.0% decrease for company-operated restaurants, and a 0.4% decrease for franchised restaurants. Net income was $2.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, a decrease compared to net income of $4.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in the same period of 2017. First quarter of 2018 included a $2.8 million pre-tax expense related to the closure of two restaurants in Texas and the decision not to move forward with the development of a third location in Texas. Pro forma net income (1) was $6.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $6.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in the same period of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $14.6 million, compared to $16.0 million in the same period of 2017.\n(1) Pro forma net income and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to each of these measures is included in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nBernard Acoca, President and Chief Executive Officer of El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc., stated, “I’ve spent the last fifty plus days immersing myself in the business, spending significant time meeting with our teams, franchisees and many operators in the field, and I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to build this special brand. In order to take El Pollo Loco to the next level, we are focusing our work on three key foundational strategies: developing a people-first culture, clarifying our brand message, and growing the business responsibly and profitably for the long term. I look forward to sharing our progress on this journey as we build upon past successes of the brand, execute our transformation agenda, and drive shareholder value.”\nAcoca continued, “While we start working against our foundational strategies, we are also looking to drive business momentum in the back half of the year through three key initiatives. First, we are determining the best way to deliver everyday value to our customers without compromising or degrading our brand as well as better communicate the tremendous value we already offer as a result of the superior quality of our food. Second, we are revisiting our media and advertising strategy to ensure we are communicating to our customers as effectively as possible. Third, we are ensuring we have the best possible products and marketing calendar in place to help us win. I look forward to sharing our progress on these initiatives in the coming months ahead.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCompany-operated restaurant revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 1.2% to $94.6 million, compared to $93.4 million in the same period last year. The growth in company-operated restaurant revenue was largely driven by the 18 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by a 2.0% decline in company-operated comparable sales, and seven restaurant closures during the same time period.\nComparable company-operated restaurant sales in the first quarter decreased 2.0%, driven by a 1.7% decrease in transactions and a 0.3% decrease in average check.\nFranchise revenue in the first quarter of 2018 decreased 3.4% to $6.1 million, compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in revenue recognized from franchise agreement and development agreement fees, lower franchise fees received from franchised restaurants related to their use of our point-of-sales system, and franchise comparable restaurant sales decline of 0.4%. This was partially offset by ten new franchised restaurants opened during or after the prior year quarter.\nIn the first quarter of 2018 the Company implemented new accounting guidance, which in part requires the inclusion of franchisee advertising fund contributions as franchise advertising fee revenue. For the first quarter of 2018, franchise advertising fee revenue was $5.1 million.\nRestaurant contribution was $17.7 million or 18.8% of company-operated restaurant revenue, compared to $19.0 million, or 20.3% of company-operated restaurant revenue in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in restaurant contribution margin was primarily the result of higher labor costs, largely due to increased minimum wage, and occupancy and other operating expenses in relation to sales volume, primarily associated with new restaurant openings.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company closed two restaurants in Texas, both of which were previously impaired during the third quarter of 2017, and decided not to move forward with the development of a third location in Texas. This resulted in a closed-store reserve of $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Pro forma net income was $6.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2017. A reconciliation between GAAP net income and pro forma net income is included in the accompanying financial data.\n2018 Outlook\nBased on current information, the Company is maintaining its earnings guidance for the fiscal year 2018.\nThe Company expects 2018 pro forma diluted net income per share ranging from $0.68 to $0.73. This compares to pro forma diluted net income per share of $0.63 in 2017. Pro forma net income guidance for fiscal year 2018 is based, in part, on the following updated annual assumptions:\nSystem-wide comparable restaurant sales growth of approximately flat; The opening of 6-8 new company-owned restaurants and 6-8 new franchised restaurants; Restaurant contribution margin of 18.7% to 19.3%; G&A expenses of between 8.2% and 8.4% of total revenue excluding CEO transition costs and legal fees related to securities related litigation, and reflecting our change in accounting for franchise advertising fees; Pro forma income tax rate of 26.5%; and Adjusted EBITDA of between $61.0 and $64.0 million.\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:\nComparable restaurant sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable company, franchised and total system restaurant base. The comparable restaurant base is defined to include those restaurants open for 15 months or longer. At March 28, 2018, there were 192 restaurants in our comparable company-operated restaurant base and 442 restaurants in our comparable system restaurant base.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution is defined as company-operated restaurant revenue less company restaurant expenses, which are food and paper costs, labor and related expenses and occupancy and other operating expenses. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of net company-operated restaurant revenue. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as identified in the GAAP reconciliation in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nPro forma net income is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Pro forma net income represents net income adjusted for (i) costs (or gains) related to loss (or gains) on disposal of assets and asset impairment and closed store costs, (ii) amortization expense and other estimate adjustments (whether expense or income) incurred on the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) completed at the time of our IPO, (iii) legal costs associated with a securities class action lawsuit, (iv) insurance proceeds received related to securities class action legal expenses, (v) costs associated with the transition of our CEO and (vi) provision for income taxes at a normalized tax rate of 26.5% and 39.5% for the thirteen weeks ended March 28, 2018 and March 29, 2017, respectively, which reflects our estimated long-term effective tax rate, including both federal and state income taxes. See the GAAP reconciliation in the accompanying financial data and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss financial results for the first quarter of 2018 today at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.
