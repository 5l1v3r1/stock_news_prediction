(NYSE American: NTN), reported financial results for the first quarter .\n\"The first quarter of 2018 ended quite strong: compared to the prior year quarter, revenues grew 10%, gross margin improved one point to 66%, SG&A as a percent of revenue decreased nine points, and EBITDA was positive for the eighth consecutive quarter,\" said Ram Krishnan, NTN Buzztime CEO. \"Sales and partnerships also advanced during the quarter. Our new tablets with order and pay using magnetic swipe, EMV and NFC capabilities are live again at 26 Buffalo Wild Wings. We also won an order for several thousand tablets, securing a partner who wants to leverage both our hardware and operating system in an entirely new vertical. And to increase ad sales, we entered into new agreements with both ad tech and reselling partners. Our investments in product development are progressing and are focused on positioning us to scale the business by expanding our addressable market within the bar and restaurant space while opening up new markets. Our product extensions include a new system management hub built on our android platform; a single-unit charger; a first release of our mobile, live trivia event platform; and a Buzztime developed arcade game, Buzztime Soccer, which we launched this week. We are working diligently to execute on our strategy, and together with the board, we are committed to building long-term shareholder value.\"\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nTotal revenues were $5.8 million, up from $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, as sales-type lease and professional development revenue increases offset lower subscription revenue. Direct costs were $2.0 million, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2017 primarily related to higher equipment lease revenue and depreciation expense. Gross margin increased to 66%, up from 65% in the prior year quarter.

In the first quarter of 2017, the company recognized a one-time payment from a supplier resulting in the lower net loss of $90,000, or $0.04 per share. EBITDA was $325,000, compared to $654,000 that also benefited from supplier payment the in the first quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Although EBITDA is positive this quarter, it may not be positive in future quarters. A detailed description and reconciliation of EBITDA and management's reasons for using this measure is set forth at the end of this press release.\nMetric Review for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nThe site count was 2,703 compared to 2,730 at December 31, 2017.

The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with GAAP, nor should EBITDA be considered as an alternative to statements of cash flows as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included herein because the Company believes it is a measure of operating performance that financial analysts, lenders, investors and other interested parties find to be a useful tool for analyzing companies like Buzztime that carry significant levels of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges in comparison to their net income or loss calculation in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles our net loss per GAAP (in thousands) to EBITDA:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet loss per GAAP\n$ (409)\n$ (90)\nInterest expense, net\n93\n159\nIncome tax provision\n2\n6\nDepreciation and amortization\n639\n579\nTotal EBITDA\n$ 325\n$ 654\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ntn-buzztime-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300645054.html\nSOURCE NTN Buzztime, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/buzztime", "http://www.facebook.com/buzztime", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ntn-buzztime-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300645054.html", "http://www.lhai.com/", "http://www.buzztime.com/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:27:07.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
