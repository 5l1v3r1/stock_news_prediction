(NASDAQ:JNCE), a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of novel cancer immunotherapies and predictive biomarkers, today reported financial results and provided a corporate update for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“The first quarter of 2018 has marked a time of consistent progress for our JTX-2011 clinical program and preclinical pipeline,” said Richard Murray, Ph.D., chief executive officer and president of Jounce Therapeutics. “We remain focused on our key value drivers that we set forth at the start of 2018 as we work to transform the cancer treatment paradigm by delivering immunotherapies with long-lasting benefits. The current unmet medical need for many cancer types remains high and Jounce is committed to understanding the tumor microenvironment and how to interrogate it in meaningful and successful ways.”\nUpcoming Clinical Milestones and Research Highlights:\nJounce will report preliminary efficacy data from two ICONIC Phase 2 combination cohorts, gastric cancer and triple negative breast cancer, at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Jounce remains on track to initiate a JTX-2011 and CTLA-4 inhibitor combination arm of ICONIC, starting with safety dose escalation, and expects to provide further updates this year. In April 2018, Jounce presented two posters at the 2018 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. The data, from genomic and histology-based nonclinical translational studies, identified ICOS as a potential target for therapeutic intervention for gastric cancer and triple negative breast cancer, supporting the inclusion of these cancer types in the ongoing ICONIC trial. Jounce remains on track to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for JTX-4014, its internal anti-PD-1 antibody in 2018. Jounce announced that it advanced its first, tumor associated macrophage candidate from its Translational Science Platform into IND-enabling studies.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nCash Position: As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $237.2 million, compared to $257.9 million as of December 31, 2017. This decrease was due to operating costs incurred during the quarter. Collaboration Revenue: Collaboration revenue was $11.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $20.3 million for the same period in 2017. Collaboration revenue represents revenue recognition relating to the $225.0 million upfront payment received in July 2016 upon the execution of Jounce’s global strategic collaboration with Celgene. The decrease in collaboration revenue was primarily due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) . Under ASC 606, Jounce has transitioned from recognizing revenue on a straight-line basis to recognizing revenue based on the pattern of performance under the global strategic collaboration with Celgene. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $18.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $15.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to $1.4 million in increased employee compensation costs related to increased headcount, $0.8 million in increased clinical and regulatory costs related to the Phase 1/2 ICONIC study of JTX-2011 and $0.7 million in increased external research and development costs, primarily attributable to IND enabling activities related to JTX-4014. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $6.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to $0.9 million in increased employee compensation costs primarily related to stock-based compensation expense and $0.4 million in increased professional services fees primarily attributable to operating as a public company. Net (Loss) Income : Net loss was $13.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, or a basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.40. Net income was $0.4 million for the same period in 2017, or a basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.02 as a result of preferred stock dividends that were accrued prior to the completion of Jounce’s initial public offering. The increase in net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is primarily attributable to the decrease in collaboration revenues and the increase in operating expenses from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Guidance:\nBased on its current plans, Jounce continues to expect cash burn on operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year 2018 to be approximately $80.0 million to $100.0 million and expects to record approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million in collaboration revenue in 2018 from the recognition of the Celgene upfront payment received in 2016.\nGiven the strength of its balance sheet, Jounce expects its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to be sufficient to enable the funding of its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months.\nConference Call and Webcast Information:\nJounce Therapeutics will host a live conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET.
