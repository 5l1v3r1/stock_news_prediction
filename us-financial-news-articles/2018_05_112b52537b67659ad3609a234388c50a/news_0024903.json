In the deal, Vodafone is buying Liberty Global's businesses in Germany , Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic.\nBut, critics argue that the deal with hinder competition and regulators may not approve. Deutsche Telekom is the largest competitor in Europe.\nFries, however, isn't worried.\n\"We absolutely anticipate regulatory approval of this deal,\" he said. \"It will be approved at the EU level. Not necessarily in Germany or any of the individual markets. That's an important distinction.\"\nThe CEO pointed out that Deutsche Telekom — \"who we know [in the U.S.] as T-Mobile \" — already dominates the German market, with 50 percent of the country's broadband customers.\nAnd the German market, he said, \"has been screaming for consolidation and a real national challenger. So together, Vodafone and our business, Liberty Global, will present a great opportunity for consumers. They're going to see innovation, investment. All kinds of benefits over the long haul.\" Daniel Leal-Olivas | AFP | Getty Images\nThe strategy will be the same: focus on leveraged equity growth and shareholder return. He calls the deal a \"premium valuation\" with a return rate of 11 ½ times 2017 EBITDA.\n\"Which, when you see the cable stocks trading at 7, is certainly a nice valuation for businesses we've owned and built for a decade or more,\" Fries said.\nHe also noted that a move like this is not new for the company.\n\"This is not the first time we've rebalanced or reshaped our platform to sort of optimize growth and optimize shareholder return,\" Fries said.\n\"This transaction is about creating a national challenger with a converged scale, meaning fixed and mobile scale,\" he said. \"It's a natural combination. You're going to see that continue in Europe, in particular\" mobile companies coming together.
