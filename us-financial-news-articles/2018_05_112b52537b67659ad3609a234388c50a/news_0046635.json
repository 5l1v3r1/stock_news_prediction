The OptiScanner ® platform is presently focused on delivering automated bedside glucose monitoring to inform clinicians' decision-making and maintain a user-defined target glucose range.\nThe company's lead product, the OptiScanner 5000, is a first-of-its-kind automated, bedside glucose monitoring system that measures values directly from plasma using spectroscopy technology without the need for calibration. The system prominently displays trending glucose data with updates every 15 minutes to help manage patients' glucose levels within an optimum target range.\nTo meet the complex monitoring needs of critically ill patients, OptiScan Biomedical is expanding the capabilities of the OptiScanner platform technology to detect additional metabolic and hemodynamic analytes within the same blood sample, which will provide valuable trending data about the condition of a critically ill patient.\nFor more information visit: www.optiscancorp.com\nContact:\nOptiScan Biomedical\nVida Strategic Partners (On behalf of OptiScan)\nPatrick Nugent, Chief Financial Officer\nTim Brons (media)\n510-342-5803\n646-319-8981\npnugent@optiscancorp.com\ntbrons@vidasp.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/optiscan-biomedical-announces-appointment-of-cary-g-vance-as-president-and-chief-executive-officer-300652059.html\nSOURCE OptiScan Biomedical Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.optiscancorp.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/optiscan-biomedical-announces-appointment-of-cary-g-vance-as-president-and-chief-executive-officer-300652059.html"], "published": "2018-05-22T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:06:01.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
