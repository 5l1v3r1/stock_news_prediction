(CSE: MDM) (OTCQX: MRPHF) (FSE: 2M0) (\"Marapharm\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Ryan George and Mr. Justin Hunter as Lead Cultivators for the Company's EcoNevada and PhenoFarm Cultivation and Production licences in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nA seasoned agriculturist, Mr. George has managed multiple large scale indoor, outdoor and off-grid cannabis cultivation facilities using a variety of techniques (hydroponics, soil and soilless mixtures) during his nine-year tenure in the cannabis industry.\nMr. George's comprehensive cannabis career has taken him around-the-world where he has attended numerous conferences and seminars to advance his knowledge of biology, genetics, and genotypes. More specifically, the effects of atmosphere, light cycles and nutrients in Desert, High Altitude and Northern climates. Additionally, he is an advocate of non-chemical pest management, and incorporates countermeasures such as employing companion plants and beneficial insects to prevent pests specific to cannabis. For the past several years, Mr. George has provided the highest quality medicinal cannabis to the medical community of Phoenix, Arizona.\nMr. Hunter, brings extensive experience in both commercial scale cannabis cultivation and management of facility operations. He has served as Director of Cultivation overseeing all aspects of facility management including the development of SOP's (the \"Standard Operating Procedures\") which are instrumental in providing elevated standards for all aspects of a heavily-regulated commercial production.\nMr. Hunter trained and managed teams of employees in effective commercialized methods of task completion, including overseeing crop management by strategizing perpetual harvest schedules, while monitoring the progress of crops for optimal quality, health and yield.\nA principal focus of Mr. Hunter's career has been perfecting his \"Pheno-hunting\", a selective cannabis breeding technique used to ensure that \"cream of the crop\" genetics are passed along to future generations by breeding clone only strains to purebred males \"hunted\" for their vigor and potency. Mr. Hunter used his expertise in this field to champion our first genetics which will be transferred to their permanent location once all inspection approvals are granted.\nAs a team, they share a dedication to an organic living soil methodology which creates a higher quality, pure cannabis while reducing the cost of production. They are committed to the development of a triple organic certified product safe for consumption.\n\"Ryan and Justin have continually demonstrated their competency and passion for cannabis cultivation over the last decade. Their combined experience in commercial cannabis cultivation, including the selection of commercially viable varietals will bring an immediate impact to our bottom line. We look forward to having both Ryan and Justin lead the EcoNevada and PhenoFarm Cultivation programs.\" Kurt Keating, Director of Operations.\nABOUT MARAPHARM VENTURES INC.\nwww.marapharm.com\nMarapharm is a publicly traded company investing in the medical and recreational cannabis space, since 2014.
