Its shares rose more than 8 percent.\nOcado also shone, up 3.5 percent after the British online grocer and technology company announced a new partnership deal with ICA Group to develop the Swedish company’s online business.\nPotential deals with overseas grocers are seen as the key influence on Ocado’s stock market valuation with past deals, such as with France’s Casino, prompting a surge in its share price.\nShares in ConvaTec rose 3.8 percent after the British medical devices maker posted a 13.7 percent rise in first-quarter revenue, as acquisitions and favourable currency moves helped offset supply chain disruptions.\nStandard Chartered retreated 1 percent as a better-than-expected 20 percent rise in pretax profit didn’t change the overall picture for the bank, Jefferies argued.\n“We do not see consensus estimates moving up on today’s release”, its analysts said.\nAmong other disappointments, Paddy Power Betfair was the worst-performer on the FTSE 100 after first-quarter earnings fell. The bookmaker’s shares dropped 6.3 percent.
