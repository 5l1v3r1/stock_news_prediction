Photo: Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery Tim Decker hoped some lichen he found in the California hills last summer would contain an exotic strain of yeast that would give a unique flavor to his home-brewed beer.\nHave an old one Mr. Decker put the lichen in a jar with a sugary solution to see if the liquid would ferment, a sign that yeast, which consumes sugars and releases alcohol, could be present. Weeks later, a small wormlike grub appeared, likely crawling out of a bit of wood attached to the lichen.\n“I knew pretty quickly that wasn’t going to be something I was going to want to put in my beer,” says Mr. Decker, 33 years old, who writes the AltBrau beer blog and plans to start a commercial brewing operation. In another such experiment, he found a spider floating in the jar.\nMr. Decker is in the vanguard of a brewing movement in the beer world: trying to find the weirdest, funkiest yeast. Even global drinks companies are entering the contest, hoping new and exclusive brews with a story behind them will entice consumers who are increasingly migrating to wine and spirits .\nBut finding new yeasts and successfully using them in a modern brewery can take years of work—and there is no guarantee of success. Brewers sometimes have to dump thousands of gallons of undrinkable beer.\nScientists at the University of Adelaide in Australia recover liquid samples from an old bottle taken from a shipwreck. Photo: Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery Danish beer company Carlsberg A/S is now selling Carlsberg 1883, which it says was brewed with a yeast strain taken from a bottle of beer about 130 years old found in a Copenhagen cellar during a construction project. Heineken NV has H41, named for the geographical latitude of an Argentine forest where a scientist found yeast on a mushroom that is thought to be an ancestor of the company’s regular brewing yeast.\nIn Australia, brewery James Squire—part of Japanese drinks giant Kirin Holdings Co. —started selling its Wreck Preservation Ale this month using a yeast strain it says is more than 200 years old. It was taken from a bottle of beer recovered from a 1797 shipwreck near Tasmania that was in the collection of the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery on the island.\nDavid Thurrowgood, conservator at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Tasmania, examines a bottle recovered from a shipwreck. Photo: Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery “We’ve heard of other people running around a botanical garden with a petri dish,” says Mark Schwarz, a former patent lawyer who co-founded Chicago-based Omega Yeast , which sells various yeast strains to beer hobbyists and craft breweries. “People are trying to find yeast everywhere they can.”\nBrewers generally use two main species of yeast, which is technically a fungus. One is ale yeast, which at relatively high temperatures ferments extracts made from malted barley and other grains, and is commonly used in baking. The other is lager yeast, which ferments the grain extracts at cooler temperatures.\nSmall genetic differences within these two species account for the many strains of yeast, which along with hops and other ingredients determine the aroma and flavor of beer. The National Collection of Yeast Cultures in England has compiled more than 4,000 strains of yeast over the past 70 years.\nBrewers at James Squire found that the yeast from the shipwreck—they sometimes call it “zombie yeast”—was at times unpredictable. A test batch failed to ferment initially because the temperature was too low, despite laboratory analysis suggesting it should work.\nBrewer Stuart Korch pours a glass of Wreck Preservation Ale, made with a yeast strain taken from a bottle from an old shipwreck. Photo: Mike Cherney/The Wall Street Journal “It was a bit alarming,” says brewer Stuart Korch, 29, who expected the batch to start fermenting over a weekend but discovered nothing had happened. “I came in on Monday and I’m just scratching my head.”\nThey tried several different beer styles, including a standard pale ale and a hoppy version called an India pale ale. The yeasty flavors in the former were too intense, but the hops overshadowed the yeast in the latter. They eventually settled on a porter, a darker beer style.\nTake a Look at Other Recent A-Heds\nThat Endless Series of Menu Options Is Paralyzing Diners Forget the Hackers, Watch Out for the Phone Snoopers Over Your Shoulder Worst Job in America: Responding to Irate Tweets From New York City Subway Riders “When you give that a good swirl, it sometimes produces a bit of a smoky, almost like bourbony, some sort of barrel-aged sort of thing. And that’s all yeast driven,” Haydon Morgan, 37, the head brewer for James Squire, said recently as he sipped a Preservation Ale at his Sydney brewery.\nHeineken says a team of 50 people spent two years working with the Argentine yeast before H41 was ready for market. Brewers tossed nearly 80,000 gallons of beer in their quest to perfect the recipe, says Willem van Waesberghe, Heineken’s global master brewer.\nH41, a lager that Mr. van Waesberghe says has a unique “clove-like aroma,” is mostly sold in Europe, though some bars in New York City and Miami have it. The company more recently developed another two beers using yeast strains from North Carolina and the Himalayas.\nBrewers Haydon Morgan and Stuart Korch examine equipment at the James Squire brewery in Sydney.

On Untappd, a social network where users rate beers, H41 scores a 3.22 out of 5, based on about 14,200 ratings. Carlsberg 1883 has a 3.03 rating, with about 3,300 reviews. In comparison, the top-rated beer, which is no longer produced, rated 4.74.\nOne fan of the new Carlsberg brew is Michael Mattingly, 34, who lives in Oregon and bought a can at a convenience store this month while on vacation in Denmark. The beer, which isn’t sold in the U.S., is an amber lager. Mr. Mattingly says he was attracted to the maroon colors on the can, which suggested to him it was a darker beer.\nMr. Mattingly, who works in law enforcement, didn’t know it was made using an older strain of yeast. “That makes it a lot cooler now,” he said after learning of the yeast’s history.\nBirgitte Skadhauge, head of the Carlsberg Research Laboratory, took the search for ancient yeast even further: She tasted some of the 130-year-old beer from which the yeast was taken. It had a very dark color and reminded her of port wine.\n“As a scientist, sometimes you take a chance,” she says, noting the old brew could have given her digestive problems. “But it didn’t at all. It was beautiful.”\nWrite to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T01:49:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
