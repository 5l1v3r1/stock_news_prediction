(Nasdaq:EVOL) , a leader in real-time digital engagement solutions and services, today announced that it was selected by a leading Latin American operator to power its nationwide wholesale mobile network. Evolving Systems provided its market-leading SaaS Customer Acquisition and Activation platform to the operator to successfully support its recent service rollout.\nUnder terms of the five-year managed services contract valued at approximately $1.4 million, Evolving Systems will collect upfront service establishment and integration fees as well as contractually guaranteed recurring management fees, for the support and management of the mobile activation platform. Evolving’s customer acquisition and activation platform enables carriers to better attract, retain and monetize mobile subscribers, allowing the operator to attract more MVNOs to its network by offering the ability to significantly simplify eSIM (embedded SIM) and SIM service-bundle sales, ordering, distribution, activation and number management functions. The platform also optimizes critical revenue-generation and management functions in the network including dynamic subscriber-activation related resource management. Examples include first-point usage detection that enables customer engagement, device activation and management across multiple geographic regions within the operator’s territory which can be challenging due to complex and diverse regulatory, tariff and distribution requirements.\n“With a mandate to create a shared network that would not only attract partner MVNOs but be something that could reliably scale to support almost an entire country’s population and be delivered under tight timelines, they had to ensure their activation and subscriber management platform was dynamic, robust and market-proven. Thanks to our experienced delivery team and proven software platform, we were able to exceed all customer requirements and are already engaged with this customer to support the rollout and management of this exciting new service,” said Eric Hatton, SVP Solutions at Evolving Systems.\nAmong the reasons Evolving Systems was selected over other competitors was its established leadership in serving the needs of global operators seeking to efficiently and effectively acquire, activate and service mobile subscribers as well as its local presence and familiarity with the regional market as a result of its engagement with other local telecommunications providers.\nAbout Evolving Systems ®\nEvolving Systems, Inc.
