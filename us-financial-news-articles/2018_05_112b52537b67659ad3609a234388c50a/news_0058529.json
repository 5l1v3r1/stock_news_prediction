(NASDAQ:ENPH), a global energy technology company and the world’s leading provider of solar microinverters, and Waaree Energies Ltd., India’s largest Tier 1 solar panel manufacturer, announced today a 4.5 MW solar power plant installation using Waaree Enphase AC modules. This solar power plant, located in Hosapet, India will be the largest Enphase microinverter-based solar installation globally.\nThe system’s owner, an independent power producer (IPP) chose the Waaree Enphase AC module (ACM) due to its ability to generate solar power in low-light, diffused light or shaded conditions, maximizing its energy harvest in India’s harsh, dusty environment. Occupying 18 acres and powered by 13,235 Enphase Energy™ microinverters, the system is expected to provide more than 7,500 MWh of clean power annually to businesses in Bangalore and the state of Karnataka through a mix of short- and long-term power purchase agreements. The combination of Waaree’s high quality and high reliability monocrystalline solar PV modules with Enphase Microinverters attached to the back will make the installation of 13,235 solar modules easier and faster than with conventional solar system components.\n“This 4.5MW power plant installation represents Enphase’s entry into India’s utility scale photovoltaic (PV) segment, and proves that Enphase’s value proposition of outstanding reliability, safety and performance translates to large scale systems,” said David Ranhoff, vice president and chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. “This is a truly exciting opportunity for Enphase as it furthers our expansion into India.”\n“The Waaree Enphase AC module is a high-quality product that provides an efficient and cost effective installation process,” said Hitesh Doshi, chairman and managing director, Waaree Energies Ltd. “We are pleased to be working with Enphase to offer our IPP customer unmatched reliability, as well as leading intelligence and control capabilities desired by commercial and industrial asset managers.”\nDiwakar Soltec Pvt. Ltd., a leading engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm based in Hosapet, India is due to commission the system in July 2018.\n“We are delighted to install Waaree’s mono-crystalline ACMs with Enphase Energy’s microinverters,” said K. Shreedhar, founder and director, Diwakar Soltec Pvt. Ltd. “Enphase’s made for India microinverter technology ensures superior performance under hot and humid conditions, and delivers increased yields because of its higher system availability. The system will provide us peace of mind due to its module-level monitoring capabilities.”\nEnphase also announced today that Ramesh SubbaRao has been appointed Vice President and General Manager, India Commercial Operations. Mr. SubbaRao will oversee Enphase’s commercial operations in the India region, with a focus on the country’s dominant commercial and industrial (C&I) segment.\n“We are pleased to have Ramesh join our team in India,” said David Ranhoff. \"He brings to Enphase many years of managing C&I and utility operations for the India market and experience leading international teams. With Ramesh joining Enphase, we are adding executive-level leadership to help grow our customer base in India, while leveraging his C&I and utility experience to strengthen our commercial operations worldwide.”\nRamesh has more than 23 years of semiconductor and renewable energy experience. Prior to joining Enphase, he was the chief operating officer for Asia at Lightsource BP, Europe’s largest solar developer with more than 1.3GW developed and 2GW assets under management. Before his role at Lightsource BP, Ramesh was managing director, APAC operations at SunEdison where he led a team of 150 people responsible for the engineering, construction and commissioning of over $1 billion in solar and wind projects across India, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Ramesh received his Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from Birla Institute of Science and Technology, Pilani.\n“I am thrilled to join Enphase during its pivotal growth stage in India,” said Ramesh SubbaRao. “India has set a target to deliver more than 100GW of grid-connected solar power projects by 2022, offering Enphase an opportunity to build a strong footprint and expand its share in one of the world’s largest and fastest growing solar markets. I look forward to working with the talented team to implement innovative go-to-market strategies that will further strengthen Enphase’s position, customer base and value proposition.\"\nAbout Enphase Energy, Inc.\nEnphase Energy, a global energy technology company, delivers smart, easy-to-use solutions that connect solar generation, storage and management on one intelligent platform.
