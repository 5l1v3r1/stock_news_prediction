The event was sponsored by firms such as WorldQuant LLC, Credit Suisse Group and Guggenheim Partners.\nAttendance hit a record of more than 5,000 attendees. Tickets typically cost between $12,500 and $25,000.\nWOOING INVESTORS Fund managers and marketers woo prospective investors at poolside cabanas at the Beverly Hilton hotel and private dinners in nearby restaurants and mansions.\nAn event on Tuesday night organized by EJF Philanthropies, a hedge fund-linked charity that funds conservation efforts, was held at the home of private equity billionaire Brian Sheth and featured a live cheetah.\nAnother on Monday night, hosted by investment firm Orchard Global Asset Management at Mastro’s Steakhouse, featured Senator Bob Corker and U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling and large investors in private funds.\nMilken’s positive portrayal of finance does not ring true to all.\n“Big investment firms and banks are not helping to create better jobs for most American workers. They’re helping the rich get richer,” said Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy For All Coalition, what he termed a “labor-community economic justice” group based in New York.\nMilken’s MacLean said that “public funding and philanthropic capital alone can’t bridge the funding gaps to solve global challenges.”\nEric Cantor, the former U.S. House majority leader and now vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company, told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference that he has long been drawn to Milken’s focus on capitalism as a force for good, often through partnership with the public sector.\n“It’s about how you create an environment for that collaborative effort to end up yielding one of the highest standards of living in the world,” Cantor said.
