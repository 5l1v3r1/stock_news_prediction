He had not yielded more than one earned run in any of his first four starts.\nIn the first, Gregory Polanco walked, Marte singled and Dickerson walked, loading the bases. Guerra walked Francisco Cervelli to force in Polanco for a 1-0 Pirates lead.\nThe Brewers tied it in the second on Pina’s one-out homer to left-center.\nDickerson’s homer followed Josh Bell’s single in the third for a 3-1 Pittsburgh lead.\nIn the fifth, Polanco singled and Marte hit a ball that deflected at a sharp angle off the wall and away from center fielder Lorenzo Cain, allowing Marte to follow Polanco home for his fourth homer.\nMilwaukee drew to within a run in the sixth. Christian Yelich led off with a double and scored on Jesus Aguilar’s single to make it 5-2. One out later, Santana hit a two-run shot to left, his first of the season, to make it 5-4 and chase Kingham.\nFreese led off the ninth with a line drive over the wall in right off Taylor Williams to give Pittsburgh a 6-4 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T11:59:34.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
