Based on that, full-year purchases will be close to last year’s $46 billion.\nThe ban followed a license system adopted in the past two years that had led to similarly disappointing results.\nThe government had previously announced a plan to lift the import ban without saying when it would come into force.\nIn the latest move, an official told Reuters, authorities will set up a committee made up of ministries such as finance, industry and trade to determine the list of list of goods and the duties applied.\nThe measure “is part of the protection and defense of national production ... against massive imports that are detrimental to the economy,” said the document.\nSome foreign suppliers, such as the European Union, have expressed concern as their market share in Algeria is dwindling. Algeria was in “permanent dialogue” with the EU, Trade Minister Said Djellab said earlier this month.\nOPEC member Algeria still depends on oil and gas earnings, which have fallen 50 percent since crude oil prices started dropping in 2014. Non-energy performance has been improving slowly, but Algeria is still can’t meet domestic demand.\nAnalysts believe the planned customs duties will lead to higher inflation as retail prices for goods shipped from abroad go up.\n“This measure will significantly hit the purchasing power of citizens,” said university economics professor Aberrahmane Aya.
