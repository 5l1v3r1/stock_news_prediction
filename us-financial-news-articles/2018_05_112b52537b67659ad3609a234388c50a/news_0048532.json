In another, someone with advanced breast cancer had been injured in a car accident. The other two scenarios involved a patient with late-stage lung cancer and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and a patient with advanced prostate cancer and a groin hernia.\nIn general, there wasn’t much consensus on the treatment decisions, regardless of the doctors’ specialties.\nSurgeons in particular reported fewer hours of palliative care training during residency, fellowship and continuing medical education; one in five surgeons reported no experience with palliative care training at all, the authors found.\n“We’ve seen a significant proportion of patients who go to the emergency room or intensive care unit with terminal malignancy die in the ICU,” said study coauthor Dr. Richard Bold of the University of California, Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center in Sacramento.\n“As cancer becomes a leading cause of death among aging Americans, we’re all going to have to deal with these questions, from family to primary care doctors to specialists,” Bold told Reuters Health by phone.\nPalliative care is not the same as hospice care, although the two have elements in common. Importantly, patients who receive palliative care may continue to receive treatment for their disease.\n“It is important to remember that anyone facing a life-threatening diagnosis should be eligible for palliative care,” said Dr. Mustafa Raoof of the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, California, who wasn’t involved with this study.\nRaoof and colleagues have implemented a Surgical Palliative Care Immersion Training program for junior surgeons, based on the American College of Surgeon’s “Surgical Palliative Care: A Resident’s Guide” framework.\n“Many in the field already know that this is a critical deficiency,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Our group and others have shown that it does not take much time to implement either.”\nAn overall cultural shift is also changing how surgeons make decisions about procedures near the end of life, said Dr. Pasithorn Suwanabol of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.\nSuwanabol, who wasn’t involved with this study, published a study last month which found that surgeons know about the benefits of palliative care but find it difficult to know when and how to start palliative care conversations and integrate the services. Part of this is not being able to predict what will happen next to the patient, Suwanabol said.\n“We need to better predict patient trajectories and outcomes so we can better meet their palliative care needs,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Studies should also measure patient needs from their perspective, not only from the perspective of the surgeons.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2khHlQU Surgery, online April 27, 2018.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2khHlQU"], "published": "2018-05-22T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:53:25.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
