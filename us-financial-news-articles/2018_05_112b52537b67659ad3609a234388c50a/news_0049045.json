A fifth official was acquitted.\nAbout 200,000 people were killed during the 1960-1996 conflict between leftists and the government. About 45,000 are thought to have been forcibly made to disappear.\nRelatively few people have been tried for the crimes and human rights violations. A United Nations-backed commission has said the army committed the majority of the atrocities.\nIn the case against Lucas Garcia and the three other officials, witnesses said the group participated in the 1981 torture and rape of 19-year-old Emma Guadalupe Molina Theissen, who had been detained at a roadblock with political propaganda.\nShe escaped from a military zone days later. Army members dressed as civilians then went looking for Molina at her home, but found only her 14-year-old brother, Marco Antonio Molina Theissen, witnesses said.\nHe was never seen again.\nGuatemala recognized its responsibility to investigate the disappearance in 2004 before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which ordered a search for the missing boy and for the offenders to be identified and punished.\nThe country had its first conviction for forced civil war disappearances in 2009, sentencing a former military commissioner to 150 years in prison.\nIn 2013, genocide and human rights convictions against former military dictator Efrain Rios Montt, who ruled from 1982 to 1983, were overturned by Guatemala’s top court.\nHe died in April while again on trial for the same crimes, although he maintained his innocence.\nReporting by Sofia Menchu; Writing by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T05:27:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
