In “The Guardians,” an uncommonly beautiful drama by Xavier Beauvois, work itself is a strong part of the fascination.\nMore Film Reviews\n‘Tully’ Review: Enter the Perfect Nanny May 3, 2018 ‘RBG’ Review: Courting Progress May 3, 2018 ‘Let the Sunshine In’ Review: The Infinite Allure of Mr. Wrong April 26, 2018 The story unfolds at a measured pace in France, during World War I, on a family farm where women are the guardians of the land and its traditions, while men are being slaughtered in insane, incessant conflict. (A few soldiers come back briefly on leave.) What these women do and how they do it— breaking the soil with horse-drawn wooden plows, cutting and baling wheat with sickles, scythes and weathered hands—is photographed by Caroline Champetier as a series of vignettes that might have been created by a gifted painter centuries before. That’s not the whole story, though. The radiant center of the film, in French with English subtitles, is a young woman named Francine, who is played by Iris Bry in a debut performance of remarkable purity.\nNathalie Baye and Cyril Descours Photo: Music Box Films From her first moments on screen, Ms. Bry gives her character a sense of purpose. An orphan with quietly fierce determination, red hair and a forward-looking face—it isn’t the set of her chin but the gleam in her eyes—she is only a hired hand, brought in to augment the workforce by Hortense, the family’s matriarch. (Hortense is played by the great Nathalie Baye, whose daughter, Laura Smet, plays Solange, Hortense’s daughter.) Yet Francine is the proto-modern woman of the piece. She is far from the independence she yearns for, but well on her way, despite encountering an injustice that might wreck the life of a less resilient woman. (The cast includes Cyril Descours as Georges, the sweet-spirited love of Francine’s life.)\nIris Bry Photo: Music Box Films The director and his co-writers, Frédérique Moreau and Marie-Julie Maille, adapted the screenplay from a novel by Ernest Pérochon. They make room for the complications of romance; for a scattering of American soldiers in the area; and for the onset of mechanization—a shiny new McCormick baler and, after the war, a Fordson tractor driven by Solange—that will transform the farm’s productivity. I’ve admired Mr. Beauvois’s films before, especially his exquisite (and similarly slow-paced) 2010 drama “Of Gods and Men,” which was about eight Christian monks menaced by Islamic terrorists in the Algeria of the 1990s. “The Guardians,” though, is special in a new way. Imagine devoting several years, as Mr. Beauvois did, to making a reflective, bucolic feature that is organized around the themes of community and evolving culture. It’s all too subtle for words, but perfect for moving pictures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T10:29:37.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
