He has improved over a period of time and that’s a great sign for a cricketer.\n“The way he’s batting also, he’s in touch. And everybody knows he is a gun fielder. I am happy that everything is coming out good for him.”\nThe 24-year-old seamer and hard-hitting batsman cemented his spot in the Indian side last year in all three formats of the game and is considered the team’s cleanest striker of the ball.\nOn Sunday, he kept the KKR batsmen in check with smart changes of pace during his four-over quota, including an 18th over that went for only six runs.\n“As a team, we believe we can do it. We have done it in the past though obviously it’s difficult,” Pandya said at the post-match press conference when asked if his team can once again go all the way.\n“I don’t like anything which comes easy. I like difficult things. This is a challenge and I will love to take it.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:16:12.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
