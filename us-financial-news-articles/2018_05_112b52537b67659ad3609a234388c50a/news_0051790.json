BSG Resources-controlled diamond miner Koidu Holdings Ltd is a supplier to Tiffany and Co..\nSierra Minerals, owned by Dutch industrial group Vimetco NV, runs the country’s only bauxite mine. Australia’s Iluka Resources mines mineral sands via a subsidiary.\nThose companies either declined to speak about the pending reviews or did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n“We have to remember that mining companies are here for business, to make profit at the end of the day,” Sandi said. “At the same time, as a government it’s our job to ensure that they display proper corporate social responsibility and comply with international best practices.”\nDemocratic Republic of Congo’s unilateral move to increase mining taxes and deny mining companies the right to short-term getout clauses enraged mining executives, but it also has the potential to stir up resource nationalism across the continent.\nMali’s government said in March that it was negotiating with mining companies to draft a new mining code but would move to implement a new law unilaterally if no compromise is reached.\nHowever, Sierra Leone faces the tricky task of squeezing more revenues from the extractives sector while attracting new investment after a years-long slump in commodities prices stalled projects and bankrupted some companies.\nIts economy contracted by more than 20 percent in 2015 at the height of the Ebola epidemic and Bio promised voters a national renaissance.\nHis plans include new legislation that would consolidate all mining revenues into a single account from which funds could be allocated to health and education projects in mining communities.\nSierra Leone mining law expert Sonkita Conteh told Reuters that cleaning up legislation and properly enforcing regulations should draw the investors the country desperately needs.\n“We’ve been mining in Sierra Leone for the past 80 years, and it’s very hard to point to the tangible differences,” it has made to people’s livelihoods, he said.\n“This is the time to step back and really look with a fresh eye at all of these activities and see whether the mining is of benefit to these communities rather than a few select people and companies.” (Editing by Joe Bavier and Louise Heavens)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:22:23.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
