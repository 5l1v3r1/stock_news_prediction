As of May 1 st , we had our second of three expected Q2 Solésence product launches, with a third expected by quarter end,” commented Nanophase CEO and President Jess Jankowski.\n“Our first quarter results do not reflect the growth and progress we continue to build upon from last year. A combination of timing, product mix, and the inefficiencies relating to ramping up for our first Solésence product launches have depressed our Q1 results. This resulted in lower revenue and higher costs being realized than we expected in Q1,” he added.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the first quarter was $2.9 million in 2018 and $3.5 million in 2017.\nThe net loss for the quarter was $0.92 million in 2018, or $0.03 per share, compared to net income of $50K, or $0.00 per share, for 2017.\nThe Company finished the quarter with approximately $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents; which included $0.2M of short-term debt.\nMr. Jankowski continued, “We expect growing Q2 volume from our advanced materials business, as well as six-figure revenue from the launches of our first finished products through our Solésence business. This will lead to significant improvement in our Q2 results. I’m looking forward to sharing more information during tomorrow’s call.”\nShareholders and members of the financial community are encouraged to participate in the upcoming conference call, where Mr. Jankowski will discuss the company’s current and long-term prospects.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nThe Nanophase conference call, to be hosted by Jess Jankowski, the Company’s President & CEO, is scheduled for May 4, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. CDT, 11:00 a.m. EDT.
