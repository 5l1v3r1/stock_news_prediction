It's even better than we thought. We have to raise rates even faster,'\" he said, adding that the tightening could derail the bull market.\n\"The 10-Year [yield] could very well be at 3 percent by the end of next year with a 3 percent funds rate,\" Bianco said. \"[That's when] you get an inverted yield curve.\"\nHe suggested Fed officials should evolve and begin looking at other types of data. A solution would be favoring Google Trends, according to Bianco. His research suggests it's a far more accurate predictor of how the economy is faring.\n\"We bare our souls to Google ,\" Bianco said. \"If we lose our job, we type in 'I lost my job.' You can search that stuff and what you find is you're right back to my B- argument.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T17:06:27.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
