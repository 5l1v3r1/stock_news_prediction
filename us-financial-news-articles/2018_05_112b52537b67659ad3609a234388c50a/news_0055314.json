And what they actually mean is ‘they were thinking of doing this’.”\nWhiting said he first became aware of the Ferrari issue when Allison brought it to his attention before the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April.\nIn response, Wolff felt Whiting had ‘cherry-picked’ some of the details given.\n“Various teams question the FIA every single day,” he said. “I think it’s just important to not put somebody out there and say ‘this person has questioned an illegality topic’.\n“If you say that a team has done that, that’s perfectly fine. Picking out individuals is not, I think, the right thing to do.”\nHe said also the relationship between Mercedes and Ferrari off the track, with the two seen as close allies in discussions about the sport’s future direction, would not be affected.\n“Nothing has changed in that respect. It’s like playing rugby. We can fight hard on track and try to gain an advantage ... but you can have a beer with each other afterwards.\n“We want Formula One to be successful and that is what unites us.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin; editing by Andrew Roche", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T19:37:56.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
