What we lack in many African countries is the implementation framework,” said Richard Munang, who coordinates African climate change programs for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n“We need policies to govern climate-smart agriculture, because without policies there cannot be development,” he said.\nKiringai Kamau, executive director of the Centre for Agriculture Networking and Information Sharing at the University of Nairobi, said the key to successful new agriculture policy is data gathered from farmers on the ground.\nEvidence gathered so far shows climate-smart agriculture can reduce poverty and cut hunger, said Edith Ofwona, a senior program specialist at the International Development Research Centre.\nThe farming practices Njiru has adopted are anchored in a draft climate change policy document, which, for instance, urges the county government of Embu to back more water harvesting infrastructure and urge communities to find ways to harvest water at home.\nWith water often short, “I had adopt a smart way of surviving,” Njiru said.\nGetting government policies backing climate-smart farming adopted is a first step to winning finance to put them into action, government officials said.\n“We can only allocate funds for such climate change interventions if they are anchored in some kind of law,” said Nicholas Ngece, the chief environment officer for Embu’s county government.\nMunang, of UNEP, said having policies in place can help bring in private finance and ensure banks provide cash to back the efforts.\nBesides Embu County, both Kitui and Tharaka Nithi counties are leading the way in developing community-based agricultural policies in Kenya to deal with climate change, officials said.\nReporting by Isaiah Esipisu, Editing by Laurie Goering.
