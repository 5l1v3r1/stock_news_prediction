It gave no further details.\nEsprit, which has a market capitalisation of $659 million, said the divestment would result in up to HK$200 million in one-off costs from provisions for store closures and the impairment of store assets, and would have a “negative impact” on its results for the year to June 2018.\nThe retailer on Wednesday posted an 11 percent drop in 9-month revenue.\n$1 = 7.8491 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Donny Kwok; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:34:00.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
