Completely gone. I don’t feel angry. I feel tremendous sadness for my kids,” he said.\n“I’m tremendously sad but I’ll get through this.”\nCockman said police had told him the children had died peacefully, with Kaydin in his mother’s bed.\n“All the kids died peacefully in their beds,” he said.\nPolice seized three firearms from the scene on Friday, all “longarm” weapons licensed to Peter Miles.\nLongarm weapons are shot from the shoulder, such as rifles or shotguns and are common on farms.\nPolice are still investigating the circumstances leading up to the worst mass shooting in Australia since the Port Arthur Massacre in 1996 when a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania.\nThe coroner will investigate.\nReporting by Alison Bevege; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T10:58:12.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
