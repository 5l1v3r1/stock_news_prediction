Published 4 Hours Ago Reuters\nCadence Bancorp said on Sunday it had agreed to buy State Bank Financial in an all-stock deal valued at about $1.4 billion, signaling a potential rise in regional bank consolidation in the United States.\nThe agreement, approved by the boards of both banks, will create an entity with $16 billion in assets and about 100 branches in Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Mississippi , Tennessee , and Texas , the banks said in a press release.\nInvestors expect a wave of mergers among mid-sized banks as U.S. lawmakers work to rewrite banking rules enacted after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. These changes would likely raise the limit on what is considered a systemically important financial institution, which had hampered some banks from merging.\nLawmakers also are tinkering with older bank rules, emboldened by President Donald Trump's vow to loosen banking restrictions.\nState Bank shareholders will receive 1.160 shares of Cadence class A common stock for each State Bank share, Cadence said in a statement. Cadence shares closed at $30.23 on Friday, while State Bank shares closed at $33.08.\nCadence and State Bank shareholders will collectively own about 65 percent and 35 percent of the combined company, respectively, after the deal is closed.
