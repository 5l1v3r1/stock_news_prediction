However, the Pentagon accusations highlight the concern the United States has about a Chinese military base just miles from a critical U.S. base in Djibouti.\n\"They are very serious incidents ... We have formally d√©marched the Chinese government and we've requested the Chinese investigate these incidents,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told reporters.\nWhite said the Pentagon was confident the lasers had been pointed by Chinese nationals and in the past few weeks fewer than 10 incidents had taken place. The intent was unclear.\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in one incident last month, two pilots in a C-130 suffered minor eye injuries.\nThe official said in a few instances, military grade lasers from the Chinese base had been pointed at aircraft.\nIn a brief statement, China's Defense Ministry said the U.S. accusations were false.\n\"We have already refuted the untrue criticisms via official channels. The Chinese side consistently strictly abides by international law and laws of the local country, and is committed to protecting regional security and stability.\"\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the government had conducted \"serious checks\" and told the U.S. side the accusations were groundless.\n\"You can remind the relevant U.S. person to keep in mind the truthfulness of what they say, and to not swiftly speculate or make accusations,\" she told a daily briefing in Beijing.\nDjibouti is strategically located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal.\nThis year, the U.S. military put countering China, along with Russia, at the\ncenter of a new national defense strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T12:38:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
