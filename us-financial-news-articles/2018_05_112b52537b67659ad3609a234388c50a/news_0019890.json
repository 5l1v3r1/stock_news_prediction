The tender offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on May 7, 2018.\nBased on a preliminary count by the depositary for the tender offer, 585,467 shares were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or below the final purchase price of $875 per share, including 172,790 shares that were tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery.\nThe tender offer was oversubscribed. Pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, the Company has elected to amend the tender offer to purchase 75,068 additional shares (within up to 2% of its outstanding shares) and as a result it will purchase 575,068 shares at the final purchase price of $875 per share on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of odd lots, which will be accepted in full, for a total cost of approximately $503.2 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. As such, White Mountains has determined that the preliminary proration factor for the tender offer is approximately 98.2%.
