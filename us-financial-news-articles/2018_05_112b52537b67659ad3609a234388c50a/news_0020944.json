(NYSE: NLS) today reported its unaudited operating results for the first three months ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nAll comparisons relate to the first quarter of 2017 unless otherwise indicated:\nRevenues: Total revenue increased 1.4% to $114.8 million compared to prior year of $113.3 million and guidance range of $110.0 to $113.0 million. Direct segment sales decreased 4.7% to $71.2 million primarily from the expected decline in TreadClimber ® sales, partially offset by growth of new products, including the Bowflex HVT ® product. Retail segment sales increased 13.7% to $43.0 million, reflecting strong growth across a variety of product lines, as well as growth in specialty and commercial customers. Gross Margins: Total company gross margins decreased by 320 basis points to 51.3% primarily due to a reduction in Direct gross margins, coupled with a shift in segment revenue mix from Direct to Retail. Direct margins decreased by 250 basis points due to a shift in product mix to lower margin HVT ® products and treadmills. Retail margins decreased by 80 basis points due to increased product costs. Operating income decreased 15.7% to $10.7 million compared to prior year of $12.7 million due to the decline in gross margin and added investments in key strategic initiatives. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $8.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. EBITDA from continuing operations decreased 11.8% to $13.1 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year period. At March 31, 2018, cash and marketable securities increased to $92.7 million and debt decreased to $44.0 million, compared to $85.2 million and $48.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Repurchased $2.7 million of stock in the open market as part of previously announced stock repurchase program.\nBruce M. Cazenave, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “First quarter 2018 revenue and operating income exceeded the guidance range we provided and were driven by solid momentum in our Retail segment. The Retail segment achieved 14% growth in the first quarter as we experienced broad based sales growth across existing and recently introduced products with several key partners and improved performance in the specialty retail channel. As anticipated, we experienced a decline in the Direct segment revenues due to the phase-down of the mature TreadClimber ® product line but are well positioned to return to growth in this segment beginning the third quarter of 2018. New products introduced during the middle of last year such as the Bowflex Results Series™ and HVT ® products continued to meaningfully contribute during the first quarter, and we are on track to launch additional Direct and Retail segment products later this year. The introduction of the Commercial Max Trainer ® product at the recent IHRSA show has been extremely well received, and we look forward to the anticipated uplift in Octane sales when the product starts shipping during the third quarter of this year.”\nMr. Cazenave continued, “Implementation of the multi-faceted 2018 plan we described in previous communications is proceeding as planned and on schedule. This includes systems integration, consolidation of warehousing facilities, supply base realignment and restructuring of our international sales and support teams. Progress in developing our new digital technology platform is also advancing as planned. These initiatives are anticipated to enhance and support our growth initiatives, including new product introductions and improved margins, going forward. Based on our first quarter results, planned rollout of new offerings and operational improvements, we are well positioned to return to full year top line growth in 2018, and reaffirm our full year guidance range on revenue and operating income.”\nFor further information, see “Results of Operations Information” attached hereto.\nSegment Results\nNet sales for the Direct segment were $71.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 4.7% over the comparable period last year as the expected decline in TreadClimber ® sales, coupled with a decline in Max Trainer ® sales, was partially offset by the growth of new products, including the Bowflex Results Series™ treadmills and ellipticals. Operating income for the Direct segment was $11.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $15.3 million in the first quarter of last year. Operating income was negatively impacted by the decline in gross margins and lower media returns, partially offset by a decrease in consumer financing fees. Gross margin for the Direct segment declined by 250 basis points resulting from a shift in product mix to lower margin HVT ® products and treadmills.\nNet sales for the Retail segment were $43.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 13.7% when compared to $37.8 million in the first quarter last year. The increase reflected robust growth across a variety of product lines and sales growth with specialty and commercial customers. Operating income for the Retail segment was $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.2 million in the first quarter of last year. The increase in Retail segment operating income was primarily due to the higher net sales, coupled with the non-recurrence of a $1.2 million reserve recorded in the same period of the prior year. Retail segment gross margin was 31.2% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 32.0% in the same quarter of the prior year, reflecting increased product costs due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nRoyalty revenue in the first quarter 2018 was $0.6 million, compared to $0.7 million for the same quarter of last year. The reduction in royalty revenue reflects the renegotiation of a certain license.\nFor further information, see “Segment Information” attached hereto.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and marketable securities of $92.7 million and debt of $44.0 million, compared to cash and marketable securities of $85.2 million and debt of $48.0 million at year end 2017. During the first quarter, the Company purchased $2.7 million of stock in the open market as part of its previously announced stock repurchase program.

The Company uses EBITDA from continuing operations in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes such as budgeting and establishing operational goals. The Company believes that EBITDA from continuing operations helps identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that are excluded from EBITDA from continuing operations and enhances the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects. The Company presents EBITDA from continuing operations as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP, and these results should not be regarded as a substitute for GAAP. The Company strongly encourages you to review all of its financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.\nFor a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included with this release.\nAbout Nautilus, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Vancouver, Washington, Nautilus, Inc.
