Buffett later looked at the stock and bought \"considerably more,\" the billionaire told CNBC in August.\nShares of Apple were slightly higher in premarket trading on Monday. Last week, the stock had its best week since 2011 after Buffett announced Berkshire's additional shares.\nGates was interviewed alongside Buffett and his longtime investing partner and vice chairman, Charlie Munger , who spoke to the tens of thousands attendees on a wide range of topics from their massive stake in Apple to missing out on Alphabet 's Google and Amazon to bashing bitcoin as \"rat poison.\"\nWith Berkshire's 2018 annual meeting in the books, users can revisit the highlights in CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive , which houses searchable video from 25 full annual meetings, going back to 1994, synchronized to 2,600 pages of transcripts.
