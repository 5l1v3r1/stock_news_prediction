I’m really looking forward to that, to getting there and having a really great day,” he said.\nKanneh-Mason said on Twitter in April that he received a personal call from Markle asking him to perform at the ceremony.\n“Of course I immediately said yes! What a privilege,” he wrote.\nHe was the first black musician to win the prestigious BBC competition since it was launched nearly 40 years ago.
