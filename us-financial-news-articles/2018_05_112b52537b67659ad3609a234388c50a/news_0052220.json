I’m not going to predict where that lands, we’ll have to see.”\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH Williams clambered back to finish third overall in 2014 and 2015, impressive for a privately-owned family team operating on a far smaller budget than the manufacturers, and have been fifth for the past two years.\nBut they have plenty to work on before they can start climbing back up the table again, with the Mercedes-powered car unbalanced and hard to handle.\nThe lack of performance, despite having the best engines available, is also likely to have a commercial impact. Title sponsors Martini have already announced they are off at the end of the year.\n“We all carry responsibility. The car isn’t good enough, it’s not what it should be,” said Lowe in Barcelona.\n“There are some issues with it, which fortunately we think we understand and we’re very busy doing a lot of work to fix those issues.\n“We’re not writing off this season,” he added.\nWhile Lowe was reluctant to give details, the car appears to be suffering an aerodynamic issue with the rear floor.\nLowe said that the problems were apparent right from the start of testing in March, with the drivers — the sport’s youngest and least experienced lineup — unable to drive it anywhere near the limit.\n“You see the pace is really quite bad,” said Lowe. “There are many things that are good about the car and they are unable to show themselves because the car is let down by one particular aspect,” said the Briton.\n“We have put in place...a recovery program to bring back the performance, bring back the car to the level at which we intended to operate and that program is timed up to the mid-season point.\n“We just lost our way in some critical areas which we now understand.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T05:32:45.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
