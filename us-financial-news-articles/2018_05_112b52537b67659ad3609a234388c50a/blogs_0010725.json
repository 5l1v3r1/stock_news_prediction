He liked Marathon Petroleum's $23 billion acquisition of Andeavor ; Marriott Vacations Worldwide's $4.7 billion deal to buy ILG ; and Prologis' $8.4 billion merger with DCT Industrial .\n\"Now, these three sectors — refining, timeshares, real estate investment trusts — they don't provide leadership,\" Cramer admitted. \"However, they do create instant rewards for their shareholders, and that's not nothing. These deals all take out competitors, too, so if they get approved, the resulting entities will have more pricing power.\"\nThe Prologis-DCT combination also boosted utility and REIT stocks, many of which have very high yields. To Cramer, that meant investors' worries about the 10-year Treasury yield reaching 3 percent could be fading.\nFinally, the \"Mad Money\" host lamented the shortage of upside surprises like McDonald's and Visa delivered with their earnings reports. Business may be amazing at both companies, but their results weren't enough for a sustained advance, he said.\nWhat to do In a confusing market layout like this one, Cramer encouraged investors to stick with the sectors they know are strong.\n\"First, we have to bet that the good sectors can't stay down for long and the leaders will regain their losses,\" he said. \"How can you not want to own the stocks of Microsoft or Intel after those amazing quarters ? And yes, I know the charts are band. Second, if the banks get a big boost from M&A — and remember, the profit in that group is amazing — they are too cheap to ignore.\"\nAs for the industrials, Cramer advised caution on the basis of U.S.-China trade tensions. If the trade war escalates, he predicted China would win; but if the United States is able to negotiate a better deal, then industrial stocks would surely rally, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"We understand that it's hard to sustain an advance,\" Cramer concluded. \"But when you see something like this at the end of four months of trading, you have to ask yourself, 'Hey, listen, if it's so darned bad, how does this market keep hanging in there?'\"\n\"The answer's simple: because as much as the sellers seem to want it to go down, it won't comply,\" he continued. \"There's always something working. There's always a bull market in this tape; you just need to know where to look.\"\nWATCH: Cramer talks market confusion and how to handle the pain show chapters Cramer: Mergers, value and earnings surprises are sending stocks higher—but they may not be enough for a rally 20 Hours Ago | 12:11 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Microsoft.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
