The Company has finalized its analysis and the most significant impact is the change from the presentation of value-added tax on a gross basis to net basis. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nTo provide investors with meaningful year-over-year comparison, the Company has provided a reconciliation table for the impact of adopting this new revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2018 and corresponding period in 2017 as adjusted, which was related to the change in presentation of value-added tax from gross basis to net basis.\n[1] The reporting currency of the Company is Renminbi (\"RMB\").

The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in average revenue per automaker advertiser as automakers continue to allocate a greater portion of their advertising budgets to Autohome, with increasingly diversified and optimized portfolio of products being offered. Leads generation services revenues increased 30.6% to RMB610.8 million ($97.4 million) from RMB467.6 million in the corresponding period of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a 17.6% year-over-year increase in average revenue per paying dealer as dealers continue to allocate a greater portion of their budgets to the Company's services, as well as an expanded dealer client base. Online marketplace and others revenues were RMB93.1 million ($14.8 million) compared to RMB253.6 million in the corresponding period of 2017. This was a result of the Company's strategy to de-emphasize direct vehicle sales and focus on facilitating transactions. Online marketplace and others revenues in the first quarter of 2018 consisted of revenues related to new car and used car marketplace, auto-financing business, data products and others. Excluding the revenues from direct vehicle sales, online marketplace and others would have increased substantially to RMB93.1 million ($14.8 million) from RMB18.5 million in the corresponding period of 2017.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues decreased 58.1% to RMB146.1 million ($23.3 million) from RMB348.8 million in the corresponding period of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in cost of goods sold related to direct vehicle sales. Excluding the cost of direct vehicle sales, cost of revenues would have increased 24.3% to RMB146.1 million ($23.3 million) from RMB117.6 million in the corresponding period of 2017. In addition, cost of revenues included share-based compensation expenses of RMB1.1 million ($0.2 million) during the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB4.1 million for the corresponding period of 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased 24.0% to RMB689.7 million ($110.0 million) from RMB556.4 million in the corresponding period of 2017. This increase was mainly due to increases in sales and marketing expenses and product development expenses as the Company continues to reinvest in future growth opportunities.\nSales and marketing expenses increased 29.9% to RMB398.0 million ($63.5 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB306.3 million in the corresponding period of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in offline execution and branding expenses as well as salaries and benefits. Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB11.5 million ($1.8 million), compared with RMB10.7 million in the corresponding period of 2017. General and administrative expenses increased 4.1% to RMB62.9 million ($10.0 million) from RMB60.4 million in the corresponding period of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in share-based compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB12.2 million ($1.9 million), compared with RMB9.3 million in the corresponding period of 2017. Product development expenses increased 20.6% to RMB228.8 million ($36.5 million) from RMB189.7 million in the corresponding period of 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits associated with growth in product development headcount, which is in line with the Company's strategy of strengthening its technology and big data analysis capabilities. Product development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB11.3 million ($1.8 million), compared with RMB14.5 million in the corresponding period of 2017.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit increased 46.4% to RMB523.2 million ($83.4 million) from RMB357.4 million in the corresponding period of 2017.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased 51.1% to RMB103.9 million ($16.6 million) in the first quarter of 2018, from RMB68.8 million in the corresponding period of 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in taxable income.\nNet Income attributable to Autohome Inc. and EPS\nNet income attributable to Autohome Inc. increased 47.5% to RMB482.8 million ($77.0 million) from RMB327.4 million in the corresponding period of 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share and per ADS (\"EPS\") were RMB4.11 ($0.66) and RMB4.05 ($0.65), respectively, compared with basic and diluted EPS in the corresponding period of 2017 of RMB2.83 and RMB2.80, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to A utohome Inc. and Non-GAAP EPS\nAdjusted net income attributable to Autohome Inc., defined as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets related to acquisitions, increased 41.6% to RMB520.0 million ($82.9 million) from RMB367.2 million in the corresponding period of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS were RMB4.43 ($0.71) and RMB4.36 ($0.70), respectively, compared with non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS in the corresponding period of 2017 of RMB3.18 and RMB3.13, respectively.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB7,963.6 million ($1,269.6 million). Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB421.4 million ($67.2 million), compared with RMB485.9 million in the corresponding period of 2017.\nEmployees\nThe Company had 3,977 employees as of March 31, 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nAutohome currently expects to generate net revenues in the range of RMB1,780 million ($283.8 million) to RMB1,800 million ($287.0 million) in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, representing a 25.2% to 26.6% year-over-year increase. If excluding direct vehicle sales, this represents a 29.6% to 31.1% year-over-year increase. This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary view on the market and its operating conditions, which are subject to change.\nStarting on January 1, 2018, Autohome adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard ASC 606. Under ASC 606, the most significant impact on Autohome will be the change from presentation of value-added tax on gross basis to net basis. The above guidance reflects revenues net of value-added tax under the new revenue recognition standard. If presented on gross basis including value-added tax, the same basis as that for the year 2017, net revenues are expected to be between RMB1,950 million ($310.8 million) to RMB1,970 million ($314.1 million) in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 (8:00 PM Beijing Time on the same day).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nUnited States: +1-855-824-5644\nHong Kong: +852-3027-6500\nChina Domestic: 8009-880-563\nUnited Kingdom: 0800-026-1542\nInternational: +1 646-722-4977\nPasscode: 84101341#\nPlease dial in ten minutes before the call is scheduled to begin and provide the passcode to join the call.\nA replay of the conference call may be accessed by phone at the following numbers until May 14, 2018:\nUnited States: +1-646-982-0473\nInternational: +61-2-8325-2405\nPasscode: 319289894#\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available at http://ir.autohome.com.cn .\nAbout Autohome Inc.\nAutohome Inc.
