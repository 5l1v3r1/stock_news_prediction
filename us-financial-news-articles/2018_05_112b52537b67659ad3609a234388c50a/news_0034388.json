It plans to shut another 30 million tonnes by the end of this year.\n“The market already has a consensus that capacity cutting is not equivalent to output reduction. Production at steel mills is unlikely to fall unless new environmental policy comes out,” said Wang Yili, analyst at Sinosteel Futures.\n“Downstream demand, especially infrastructure construction, went better than expected this spring. Also, the fat margins encouraged mills to churn out more products.”\nProfit margins for rebar-making touched 608 yuan ($95.81) a tonne in April, up more than 40 percent from a month earlier, Mysteel data showed, while Jefferies had estimated rebar margins at a 10-year high of $134 per tonne.\nProduction of coke, used in steelmaking, fell 3.6 percent in April to 36.72 million tonnes compared to the same period last year due to an environmental crackdown across the country. But output in April was the highest since September 2017.\n$1 = 6.3457 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason Editing by Joseph Radford\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
