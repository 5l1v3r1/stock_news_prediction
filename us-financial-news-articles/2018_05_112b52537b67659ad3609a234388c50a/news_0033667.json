But it also led to further capital-raising by funds in expectation of investor demand because of higher rates in the sector, particularly at renewal dates in June and July.\nTangency Capital, which has offices in London and Bermuda and will invest directly in non-life reinsurance risks, was founded by Dominik Hagedorn, Michael Jedraszak and Kai Morgenstern.\nInvestors have been attracted to funds that invest in catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities as a way to gain exposure to the reinsurance market, which has higher returns than many asset classes. Catastrophe bonds, for example, pay a high coupon but default if a particular natural catastrophe occurs.\nDespite capital-raising, only one insurance-linked hedge fund has launched so far in 2018, out of a market of 82 funds, according to data from industry tracker Preqin.\nWhile funds in the sector have continued to extract cash from investors, they have also suffered losses.\nThe CATCo Reinsurance Opportunities Fund, managed by Market CATCo Investment Management, last week said it was increasing its loss reserves, highlighting greater losses in the Caribbean from Hurricane Irma. The announcement led to a 20 percent drop in its share price.
