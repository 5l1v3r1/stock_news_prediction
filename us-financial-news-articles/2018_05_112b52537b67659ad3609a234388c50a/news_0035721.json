The peso has lost nearly a quarter of its value this year.\nMarkets seem to have taken little solace from a statement by President Mauricio Macri that he considered the recent turbulence in the foreign exchange market to be over.\nMacri called on his administration to quicken the pace of its deficit-cutting program as Buenos Aires seeks a programme with the International Monetary Fund.\nMeanwhile oil prices hit their highest level since November 2014 on tightening supplies. Strong demand added to pressure on emerging economies that rely on oil imports.\nBut losses spread beyond the two hot spots, with South Africa’s rand, Russia’s rouble and China’s yuan all booking losses.\n“Emerging market currencies have moved a decent amount in the past month and as group they are stretched on simple technical indicators,” Societe Generale analysts told clients in a note, adding that seeing emerging currencies in such an oversold situation since 2015 had normally sparked a rally.\nHowever, U.S. Treasury yields might have to take a breather for this to happen, the analysts said, warning that “trading against the strong dollar trend is always challenging.”\nWith currencies under pressure, signs were mounting that the rate cut cycle across emerging markets was grinding to a halt.\nBrazil’s central bank, which had seen the real hit two year lows in the recent sell-off, surprised markets by keeping rates unchanged contradicting widespread forecasts of a cut.\nPolicymakers in Indonesia are expected later in the day to hike rates by 25 basis points as the currency flirts with its weakest level since December 2015. Central banks in Mexico and Egypt are expected to hold rates steady.\nMeanwhile emerging market stocks were also under pressure, falling 0.3 percent and set on track for lose more than 1 percent over the week.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see (Reporting by Karin Strohecker, additional reporting by Sujata Rao in London and Rodrigo Campos in New York Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-17T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:17:34.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
