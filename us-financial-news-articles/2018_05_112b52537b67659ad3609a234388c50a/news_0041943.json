Q2 is showing progress in cash received.\nDiscussions continue with several self-insured organizations that serve high risk workforces. As disclosed, this past period included presentations to multiple groups, including a large union, to generate support for using GeneNews' tests for cancer risk stratification to help identify patients who need to be placed in active surveillance.\nAnother key development has been the MyCancerRisk Data Analyticsâ„¢ Platform which is being developed to track and analyze aggregate cancer screening data in order to monitor performance on testing and early intervention. This platform will bring significant value to large healthcare systems and self-insured organizations who want to monitor compliance with cancer screening, risk stratify their patient populations, and improve early intervention. The program will also deliver economic comparisons of early and late intervention.\n\"After nearly two years of very careful preparation, the pieces are in place and it is now a matter of execution,\" said Howard-Tripp. \"We are fully focused on executing\".\nQ1 2018 Financial Results\nAll amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated and results are reported in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, we reported a consolidated net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.00 loss per common share, as compared with a consolidated net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.02 loss per common share, for the same period in 2017. The $0.9 million decrease in net loss primarily results from a $0.6 million change in revaluation of warrants, by decreases in general and administrative expenses of $0.2 million, in cost of goods sold of $0.1 million, in finance costs of $0.1 million, offset by declines in revenue of $0.2 million.\nOur partner, JTS, is currently assisting with the implementation of a new billing process at IDL, the transition to which resulted in having to cease billing, switch to JTS and an in-house operation, and re-start billing. This change over has, of necessity, negatively impacted revenues. Invoicing for tests run but not billed during this transition period is expected to be submitted to payers in Q2 2018 and collected thereafter as well as follow up of previously submitted billings.\nThe Company's financial statements and management's discussion and analysis are available on www.sedar.com .\nAbout GeneNews\nGeneNews, an innovator in the liquid biopsy space, is committed to becoming a leader in advanced diagnostics and personalized medicine, serving as a strong commercialization outlet for early detection of cancer and other chronic diseases.
