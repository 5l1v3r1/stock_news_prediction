Regional data showed annual inflation in four German states steady in April, suggesting price pressures in Europe’s largest economy are stable.\nThe euro dropped 0.4 percent to $1.2088, not far from its three-month lows last week of $1.2110.\nRATE CORRELATION BACK? The correlation between U.S. yields and the dollar had broken down earlier this year as investors focused more on trade frictions and geopolitical issues.\nBut markets have recently turned their attention back to interest rate plays as concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute and tensions over North Korea’s nuclear programme calmed, giving the greenback a leg up.\nPositive earnings from U.S. technology firms and marquee M&A deals have also helped sentiment into this week.\n“Even if the rate expectations for the euro zone have recently eased they remain too high in our view. We expect a further downside correction over the course of the year, which is likely to put pressure on the euro in the end,” Commerzbank analysts said.\nElsewhere, the dollar rose versus the Japanese currency, up 0.2 percent to 109.25 yen, having set a 2-1/2 month high of 109.54 yen on Friday. Trading was thin with Japanese markets closed for a holiday.\nSterling tumbled further, hitting a low of $1.3715, as the dollar gained and investors further trimmed expectations that the Bank of England would raise rates next month following weak first-quarter GDP data published last week.\nThe U.S. currency also gained versus the Canadian and Australian dollars, the latter down half a percent and close to its 4-1/2 month low reached last week.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-04-30T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T00:26:25.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
