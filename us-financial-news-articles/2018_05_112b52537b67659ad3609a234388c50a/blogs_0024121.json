Banks say Odebrecht's asset sales program is proceeding more slowly than expected. Supervia was seen by the banks as an example of the delayed assets sale.\nOdebrecht has not received all the proceeds from the deals it announced, mostly due to legal hurdles to close deals in countries such as Peru.\nFor instance, Odebrecht sold its hydroelectric plant Chaglla in northern Peru last August to a consortium led by China Three Gorges Corp for $1.39 billion, but so far has not received the proceeds.\nBut creditors say in the case of Supervia, there is no pending legal issue preventing the sale.\nSince Mubadala expressed interest in Supervia, two other groups, Starboard Restructuring Partners and RTM Brasil, showed interest and plan a joint bid, according to one of the sources.\nBTG Pactual, Itaú, Mubadala and Starboard did not immediately comment on the matter. Odebrecht said in an emailed statement to Reuters that its transportation unit \"is in talks with another investor to sell its stake in Supervia.\"\nOdebrecht acquired 60 percent of Supervia in 2011. The company operates urban commuter trains in 12 cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro and transports around 750,000 people daily.
