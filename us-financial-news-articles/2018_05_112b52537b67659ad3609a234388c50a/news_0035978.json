In particular, parents increasingly feel that the cost of college shouldn't fall on them alone.\n\"There's a sense of realism that college is expensive and parents cannot pay for it all on their own,\" said Marie O'Malley, senior director of consumer research at Sallie Mae.\nIndeed, this year, nearly 60 percent of parents say their child should chip in for their education, up from around 50 percent in 2016, the report found.\nParents expect their savings to cover just about a third of their child's higher education price tag.\nParents are also growing more protective of their nest egg. Just 10 percent of parents plan to tap their retirement savings for their child's education, compared with 20 percent in 2016.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nUniversal basic income: U.S. support grows as Finland ends its trial\nHow to join the ranks of money-savvy independent workers\nMeghan Markle's tax bill will get a lot more complicated after royal wedding", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:48:09.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
