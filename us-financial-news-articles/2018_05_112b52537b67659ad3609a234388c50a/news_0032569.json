Its campaign had previously been limited to occasional air strikes and bombardments.\nDerna is controlled by a coalition of Islamists and rebel veterans known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC).\nAfter Libya split between rival camps in the east and west of the country in 2014, Haftar gradually emerged as the dominant figure in the east. He is aligned with a parliament and government based in the east and opposes the internationally recognised government in the capital Tripoli.\nThe United Nations is leading efforts to stabilize Libya and prepare it for elections before the end of the year.\nEgypt, which backs the LNA, has several times carried out air strikes in Derna on what it said were training camps sending militants into Egypt.\nTroops were advancing on five frontlines supported by air strikes and artillery, said Abdel-Karim Sabra, a spokesman for the operation.\nThe troops advanced to villages some 4 kms (two and a half miles) from the city, LNA sources said.\nSabra did not have casualty figures but websites close to the DMSC said five people were killed in air strikes.
