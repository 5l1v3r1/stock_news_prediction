Table 1 below shows selected financial data for Q1-18 compared with Q1-17 and Q4-17. All periods presented reflect the two-for-one stock split in Q4-17.\nTable 1*\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nNet\nIncome/(loss)\nNet\nIncome/(loss)\nper Diluted\nShare\nNon-GAAP\nNet Income/(loss)\nper Diluted\nShare**\nQuarterly Comparisons\nCurrent quarter: Q1-18 $169,567 $37,217 $0.21 $0.18 Prior year’s quarter: Q1-17 $139,039 $45,471 $0.25 $0.18 Change: Q1-17 to Q1-18 22% (18%) (16%) 0% Prior quarter: Q4-17 $182,922 ($27,747) ($0.16) $0.24 Change: Q4-17 to Q1-18 (7%) N/M N/M (25%) * The financial results for all periods presented reflect the retroactive adoption of a new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”) that became effective on January 1, 2018. This standard did not have a material impact on total revenue. For a historical perspective, Exhibit 4 of this news release includes the company’s quarterly Statement of Operations for 2017 adjusted for the impact of the new standard.\n**Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per diluted share excludes tax adjustments. A reconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP is shown in Exhibit 2 of this news release.\n“Overall, our results for Q1 2018 were good,” said Dr. Robert J. Shillman , Founder and Chairman of Cognex. “Revenue grew 22% year-on-year, which was above our long-term target for revenue growth. We were also highly profitable, reporting an operating margin of 20% and a net margin of 22%. Nevertheless, while many companies would applaud these results, we are dissatisfied given the higher levels of profitability that we demonstrated in 2017.”\n“Revenue in Q1 grew across most end markets and geographic regions, reflecting broad demand for our products,” said Robert J. Willett , Chief Executive Officer of Cognex. “Investing for the future remains key to our ongoing success, and, therefore, we will continue to aggressively develop new products, expand our world-wide sales force and make strategic IT and infrastructure investments.”\nMr. Willett continued, “Following a record year in 2017, we face tough comparisons this year, particularly in the second half, due to anticipated lower demand from consumer electronics—our largest industry vertical. Because of that, we believe that Cognex revenue over the next nine months will be relatively flat in total with the comparable period in 2017.”\nDetails of the Quarter\nStatement of Operations Highlights – First Quarter of 2018\nRevenue increased 22% from Q1-17 and declined 7% from Q4-17. In constant currency, revenue grew 17% year-on-year and declined 9% sequentially. Revenue from the majority of the company’s end markets grew worldwide, both year-on-year and sequentially. A notable exception was revenue from the consumer electronics industry, which declined from both Q1-17 and Q4-17. Gross margin was 76% for Q1-18 compared with 77% for Q1-17 and 76% for Q4-17. Gross margin decreased year-on-year due primarily to a slight increase in the proportion of service-related revenue. Research, Development & Engineering (RD&E) expenses increased 36% from Q1-17 and 15% from Q4-17. The increases in RD&E reflect higher sequential and year-on-year investments in engineering resources and employee-related costs for the development of new products, as well as a sequential increase in support of high-volume opportunities. Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 37% from Q1-17 and 5% from Q4-17. SG&A increased year-on-year and sequentially due to investments in sales resources and higher employee-related costs. Cognex reported foreign currency losses of $134,000 in Q1-18, $263,000 in Q1-17, and $1,027,000 in Q4-17. The foreign currency losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable balances reported in one currency and collected in another. Investment and other income was $3,517,000 in Q1-18, $2,282,000 in Q1-17, and $2,923,000 in Q4-17. Investment income increased both year-on-year and sequentially due primarily to higher yields on invested balances. The effective tax rate was 2% in Q1-18, (16%) in Q1-17, and 153% in Q4-17. The rate was 15%, 18% and 18%, respectively, excluding tax adjustments (which are summarized in Exhibit 2). Notably, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a net tax charge of $83 million in Q4-17. All periods presented include a varying discrete tax benefit related to employee stock options exercised during that quarter.\nBalance Sheet Highlights – April 1, 2018\nCognex’s financial position as of April 1, 2018, continued to be very strong, with $803 million in cash and investments and no debt. Cash and investments decreased by $25 million from the end of 2017. During the quarter, cash inflows consisted of $55 million generated from operations and $11 million received from the exercise of employee stock options. Cash outflows included $69 million spent to repurchase Cognex common stock, $8 million in dividends paid to shareholders, and $13 million for capital expenditures. Cognex intends to continue to repurchase shares of its common stock in Q2-18, subject to market conditions and other relevant factors. Inventories increased by $28 million, or 42%, from the end of 2017, to prepare for large customer shipments expected in the coming quarters and to meet upcoming new product introductions.\nFinancial Outlook – Q2 2018\nThis financial outlook reflects the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”) that took effect on January 1, 2018. Cognex does not believe this standard will have a material impact on total revenue. For a historical perspective, Exhibit 4 of this news release includes the company’s quarterly Statement of Operations for 2017 adjusted for the impact of the new standard.\nRevenue for Q2-18 is expected to be between $200 million and $210 million, which represents growth between 12% and 18% year-on-year. Gross margin is expected to be in the mid-70% range, which is Cognex’s target range for gross margin under the new revenue recognition standard. Operating expenses are expected to be essentially flat on a sequential basis. The effective tax rate is expected to be 15% before discrete tax items.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nExhibit 2 of this news release includes a reconciliation of certain financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP. Cognex believes these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful because they allow investors to more accurately compare Cognex results over multiple periods using the same methodology that management employs in its budgeting process and in its review of Cognex’s operating results. Non-GAAP presentations exclude the following: (1) stock option expense for calculating non-GAAP adjusted operating income and net income from continuing operations (because these expenses have no current effect on cash or the future uses of cash, and they fluctuate because of changes in Cognex’s stock price), and (2) certain one-time discrete events, such as tax adjustments (because these costs are outside of Cognex’s normal business operations). Cognex also uses results on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate performance. Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if the exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. Cognex does not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. The tax effect of items identified in the reconciliation is estimated by applying the effective tax rate to the pre-tax amount. However, if a specific tax rate or tax treatment is required because of the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction where the item was recorded, the tax effect is estimated by applying the relevant specific tax rate or tax treatment, rather than the effective tax rate.\nAnalyst Conference Call and Simultaneous Webcast\nCognex will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).
