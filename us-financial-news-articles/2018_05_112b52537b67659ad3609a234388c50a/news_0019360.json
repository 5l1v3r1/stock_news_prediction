(NASDAQ:MGEN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapies, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results and provided a corporate update.\n“With three product candidates now in clinical development and additional preclinical programs targeting multiple indications, we are continuing to advance, de-risk and build confidence in our pipeline of potential microRNA targeted therapies,” said William S. Marshall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of miRagen Therapeutics. “Cobomarsen and MRG-201 remain on track to advance into Phase 2 clinical trials later this year, and we were pleased to have recently initiated two Phase 1 clinical trials for MRG-110 in collaboration with our partner, Servier. We also continued to expand the potential of our innovative microRNA technologies by unveiling a new preclinical program evaluating microRNA mimics of the microRNA-183/96/182 cluster involved in retinal degeneration.”\nMarshall continued, “We are encouraged by the advancement of our pipeline of microRNA therapeutic candidates and excited about the opportunities that our microRNA focused discovery and development platform could provide as our clinical programs continue to show promising efficacy and safety profiles.”\nRecent Achievements and Anticipated Progress\nCobomarsen\nmiRagen closed enrollment in its Phase 1 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) trial and plans to release additional data from this study, including response rates from longer-term duration of treatment, in the first half of 2018. miRagen continued to evaluate patients in its Phase 1 clinical trial of cobomarsen for other oncology indications and plans to release interim Phase 1 data in at least one of these potential expansion indications in the second half of 2018. With enrollment in the Phase 1 CTCL trial now closed, miRagen plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial, evaluating cobomarsen in patients with CTCL in the second half of 2018 which, based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, could allow us to apply for accelerated approval.\nMRG-201\nmiRagen recently filed an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for MRG-201 and plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate MRG-201 in subjects with a predisposition for keloid formation in the second quarter of 2018. In May, miRagen presented preclinical data demonstrating the potential of MRG-201 to inhibit the expression of multiple factors responsible for fibrosis in disease models in both the cornea and retina. In the second half of 2018, miRagen anticipates releasing preclinical in vivo data from its lung fibrosis studies.\nMRG-110\nIn March, Servier and miRagen initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MRG-110 in a systemic dosing protocol to support additional clinical studies for the potential treatment of heart failure. The dosing of the first patient in this trial triggered a €3.0 million milestone to miRagen under the terms of its agreement with Servier. In May, miRagen announced that it had initiated a separate Phase 1 trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MRG-110 after intradermal administration for potential use in indications such as surgical incisions, severe lacerations or chronic wounds. miRagen also recently released preclinical data showing administration of MRG-110 improved tissue perfusion and wound healing. Results from these studies in a preclinical model which closely reflects human wound healing helped to inform the joint decision by miRagen and Servier to move MRG-110 into human clinical evaluation for potential use in dermal revascularization.\nPreclinical Pipeline\nmiRagen unveiled a new program to evaluate microRNA mimics of the microRNA-183/96/182 cluster for potential use in progressive vision loss. Mimics of this microRNA cluster have been shown to play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of neurosensory cells, including photoreceptors and hair cells (cells associated with hearing). In May, miRagen presented data showing mimics of the microRNA cluster were able to cause functional improvement of photoreceptors and vision in a preclinical model of retinal degeneration.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 were $78.1 million, compared to $47.4 million at December 31, 2017. Total net cash used in operations was approximately $7.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. In February 2018, miRagen completed an underwritten public offering of 7,414,996 shares of its common stock. Proceeds to miRagen from the offering were $37.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. miRagen expects that the cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund its operations into early 2020.\nRevenue\nRevenue was $4.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in revenue was due primarily to a €3.0 million (or $3.7 million) milestone payment earned under the Servier collaboration upon the initiation of the first Phase 1 trial of MRG-110 in March 2018, as well as an increase in research and development activity reimbursable under the Servier collaboration.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in research and development expenses was driven primarily by increased personnel-related costs as miRagen added to its research and development team in 2018, as well as higher technology license fees and clinical development expenses to support expanded development stage programs. General and administrative expenses were $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to lower professional fees, which were partially offset by higher personnel related costs, as miRagen added to its general and administrative team in 2018.\nNet Loss\nNet loss available to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.7 million, or $0.18 per share, as compared to a net loss of $7.0 million, or $0.60 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nConference Call Information\nmiRagen will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results for the first quarter 2018. Participants may access the call by dialing (888) 394-8218 in the U.S. or (323) 701-0225 outside the U.S. and providing the conference ID number 8152157.

MRG-110, an inhibitor of microRNA-92, is being developed under a license and collaboration agreement with Servier for the treatment of heart failure and other ischemic disease. In addition to these programs, miRagen is developing a pipeline of preclinical product candidates. The goal of miRagen’s translational medicine strategy is to progress rapidly to first-in-human studies once it has established the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic, safety and manufacturability of the product candidate in preclinical studies.
