This distribution will be paid on May 31, 2018 to holders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2018. Apollo intends to distribute to its shareholders on a quarterly basis substantially all of its distributable earnings after taxes and related payables in excess of amounts determined by its manager to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of its business.\nOn March 19, 2018, Apollo issued 12,000,000 6.375% Series B Preferred shares at $25.00 per share. Distributions on the Series B Preferred shares, when and if declared by the manager of Apollo, will be payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2018. Distributions on the Series B Preferred shares are non-cumulative.\nApollo has declared a cash distribution of $0.398438 and $0.380729 per Series A and Series B Preferred share, respectively, which will be paid on June 15, 2018 to holders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2018. The first distribution on Series B Preferred shares is calculated based on the date of the original issuance.\nThe declaration and payment of distributions on Class A shares, Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred shares are at the sole discretion of Apollo’s manager. Apollo cannot assure its shareholders that they will receive any distributions in the future.\nRevenue Recognition: New U.S. GAAP Guidance\nEffective January 1, 2018, Apollo adopted new U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance and implemented a change in accounting principle related to performance allocations (commonly known as “carried interest income” or “performance fees”). The new guidance resulted in immaterial changes to the recognition of incentive fees on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis and resulted in incentive fees being presented separately in the results. Apollo adopted the new revenue guidance on a modified retrospective basis. In connection with the change in accounting principle, Apollo now accounts for performance allocations under the U.S. GAAP guidance for equity method investments, and presents performance allocations as a component of investment income along with the related principal investment income (loss). All prior periods have been conformed for this change in accounting principle.\nConference Call\nApollo will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
