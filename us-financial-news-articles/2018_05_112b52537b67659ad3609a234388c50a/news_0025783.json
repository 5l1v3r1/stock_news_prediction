Corona, President and Chief Executive Officer, announced revenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1.4 billion, a 6.2% increase, or 3.5% in constant currency, compared to the corresponding quarter of 2017.\nEarnings from operations for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $12.0 million, compared to the $16.4 million reported for the first quarter of 2017. Included in earnings from operations in the first quarter of 2017 are restructuring charges of $2.4 million. Excluding the restructuring charges, adjusted 2017 earnings from operations were $18.8 million.\nDiluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.74 compared to $0.31 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Included in earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 is the favorable impact of $0.42 due to the after-tax gain on our investment in Persol Holdings common stock. Effective in 2018, changes in the fair value of our investment in Persol Holdings common stock will be reflected as gains or losses on our Consolidated Statement of Earnings below earnings from operations. Included in earnings per share in the first quarter of 2017 is the unfavorable impact of $0.04 related to restructuring charges. The impacts of these adjustments are more fully described in the included reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.\nNotwithstanding a tightening labor market across all categories, Corona expressed confidence in Kelly’s direction, stating: “In the first quarter we saw top-line growth, robust growth in fees, and upward momentum in Outcome-Based Services. As our growth in the first quarter was at a slower pace, we are closely monitoring market dynamics to ensure our expenses are in line with our expected revenue and GP growth. We will continue to focus on our strengths, make strategic investments in technology to connect with talent and customers like never before and pursue our strategy with urgency.”\nKelly also reported that on May 9, its board of directors declared a dividend of $0.075 per share. The dividend is payable June 6, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 22, 2018.\nIn conjunction with its first quarter earnings release, Kelly Services has published a financial presentation on the Investor Relations page of our public website and will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. (ET) on May 10 to review the results and answer questions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nManagement believes that the non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) information excluding the 2017 restructuring charges and 2018 gain on investment in Persol Holdings is useful to understand the Company's fiscal 2018 financial performance and increases comparability. Specifically, Management believes that removing the impact of these items allows for a more meaningful comparison of current period operating performance with the operating results of prior periods. These non-GAAP measures may have limitations as analytical tools because they exclude items which can have a material impact on cash flow and earnings per share. As a result, Management considers these measures, along with reported results, when it reviews and evaluates the Company's financial performance. Management believes that these measures provide greater transparency to investors and provide insight into how Management is evaluating the Company's financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(1) Restructuring charges in 2017 represent costs related primarily to optimizing our GTS service delivery models to deliver expected cost savings.\n(2) Gain on investment in Persol Holdings in 2018 represents the change in fair value of the investment during the period presented.\nSource:Kelly Services, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/kellyservices", "http://www.linkedin.com/companies/kellyservices", "https://www.kellyocg.com/", "https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/kxyskz8c", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fd4f0b13-c29e-49b8-98aa-8797954bf433", "http://ir.kellyservices.com/events-and-presentations", "http://www.facebook.com/kellyservices"], "published": "2018-05-10T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:05:23.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
