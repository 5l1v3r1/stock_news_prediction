REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo The comments by Deputy Minister of Finance Terence Mukupe - which echoed warnings that the military often made under former president Robert Mugabe - provoked outrage on social media and prompted a government spokesman to describe them as a threat to national security.\nIn an online video, Mukupe is seen telling a rally in Harare on Monday that the army would not let opposition leader Nelson Chamisa take power if he defeated President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\nZimbabwe is set to hold a general election by Aug. 22, the first since the army forced 94-year-old Mugabe to resign and thrust Mnangagwa into power last November.\nConstantino Chiwenga, the general who led the de facto coup, has since become vice president.\n“Our country, given where we are and where we are coming from, needs a mature person, a steady hand,” Mukupe told supporters in the Shona language. “We cannot say, honestly, the army took the country, practically seized the country from Mugabe, so that they can hand it over to Chamisa.”\nMukupe did not answer several calls to his phone.\nHis comments will bolster claims by those still loyal to Mugabe who say he was removed illegally.\nSimon Khaya Moyo, acting information minister, said in a statement that the comments did not represent the position of the ruling ZANU-PF party, government or the military.\n“Suggesting that our well-respected security organs will act in a partisan manner in relation to the country’s politics, apart from being unauthorized, are unlawful, reckless, improper, uncalled for and thus totally condemnable,” Moyo said.\n“They imperil national peace and stability, and amount to a frontal challenge to the tenets and practices of democracy.”\nDuring Mugabe’s nearly four decades in power, the army frequently said it would not allow the opposition to take power and military commanders openly supported ZANU-PF.\n(Corrects spellings of names in second and sixth paragraphs.)\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Joe Brock and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:06:30.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
