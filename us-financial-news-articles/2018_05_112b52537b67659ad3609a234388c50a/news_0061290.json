(NYSE: SWZ), a non-diversified registered closed-end investment company, announced today that the Fund's Board of Directors has approved the adoption of a managed distribution plan (the \"Plan\") in reliance on exemptive relief granted on May 21, 2018 by the Securities and Exchange Commission to permit the Fund to distribute long-term capital gains more frequently than once per year as permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The primary purpose of the Plan is to provide the Fund's stockholders with a more consistent, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution on a regular, quarterly basis. The Plan also may have the effect of narrowing the discount to net asset value per share at which the Fund's shares trade.\nThe Fund's Board of Directors currently anticipates that, commencing in June 2018, the Fund will make quarterly distributions pursuant to the Plan stated in terms of a fixed amount of $0.2025 per share of the Fund's common stock. This distribution amount equates to an annualized distribution rate of 6.00% based on the Fund's net asset value of $13.50 and an annual distribution rate of 6.59% based on the closing share price of $12.30 as of May 25, 2018. The Board will review periodically the terms of the Plan, including at least annually to determine whether to adjust the distribution rate, which may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance and other factors.\nDistributions under the Plan may consist of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and, to the extent necessary, return of capital (or other capital sources). With each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income, the Fund will issue a notice to stockholders and an accompanying press release that will provide detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution, as well as certain other related information. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in each notice will be estimated, are likely to change over time and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its full fiscal year, and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send each stockholder a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell stockholders how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nUnless a stockholder has otherwise elected, distributions declared pursuant to the Plan will be reinvested automatically in shares of the Fund's common stock as provided in the Fund's automatic dividend reinvestment plan.\nThe Board may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's stockholders. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares of common stock.\nAbout The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc.\nThe Fund ( www.swzfund.com ) is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long-term capital appreciation through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies. Its shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol \"SWZ.\" The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing generally in Swiss equity and equity-linked securities that are traded on a Swiss stock exchange, traded at the pre-bourse level of one or more Swiss stock exchanges, traded through a market maker or traded over the counter in Switzerland.

The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.\nThe Fund is managed by Schroder Investment Management North America Inc. and Schroder Investment Management North America Limited.\nAbout Schroder Investment Management North America Inc.\nSchroder Investment Management North America Inc. and Schroder Investment Management North America Limited, investment advisors registered with the U.S. SEC, are units of Schroders plc (SDR.L), a global asset management company with approximately $614.6 billion under management and administration as of March 31, 2018.
