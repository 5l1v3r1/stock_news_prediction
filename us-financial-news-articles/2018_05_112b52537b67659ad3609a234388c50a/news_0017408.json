The save was Hand’s ninth of the season and second in as many games in the Mexico series.\nThe shutout was as much as case of missed opportunities for the Dodgers as dominance by Padres pitchers. Los Angeles stranded runners in each of the first eight innings and went 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position while leaving a total of 13 runners on base.\nRoss Stripling made the spot start for the Dodgers on the same day staff ace Clayton Kershaw (left biceps tendinitis) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. A late substitution for scheduled starter Rich Hill (finger), Stripling held the Padres scoreless on three hits and two walks with five strikeouts in four innings.\nHowever, the Padres got to the Dodgers’ bullpen.\nTravis Jankowski greeted left-handed reliever Tony Cingrani — who was a part of the Dodgers’ four-pitcher no-hitter in the series opener Friday night — with a fifth-inning single, and Hosmer followed with his fifth homer of the season and third in five games.\nThe Padres added a run in the seventh. Jankowski opened the inning against Pedro Baez with his second triple in as many games. He scored on Franchy Cordero’s third single of the game — a liner to center off Yimi Garcia.\nThere were a total of 22 stranded runners in the game with Cordero having the game’s only hit with runners in scoring position.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T03:19:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
