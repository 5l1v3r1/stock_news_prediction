This mode allows up to 100 online players to violently battle each other to the death until only one player survives. The company revealed in January that the game has been played by more than 45 million people worldwide. It is also consistently the most streamed game on Twitch.\nOne Wall Street analyst is optimistic Activision's inclusion of a battle-royale mode in its \"Call of Duty\" title will be able to compete effectively with \"Fortnite.\"\n\"Given the strong recent performance of Battle Royale games including 'Fortnite' and 'PUBG,' Black Ops 4 will feature its own BR mode,\" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"We believe new additions should drive strong player engagement and monetization trends.\"\nSebastian reiterated his outperform rating for Activision Blizzard shares and his $80 price target, representing 14 percent upside to Wednesday's close.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": ["https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/call-duty-black-ops-4-delivers-game-changing-experience-deepest"], "published": "2018-05-17T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:31:48.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
