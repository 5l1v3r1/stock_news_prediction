It is their best 17-game run since also going 16-1 from June 3-18, 1953.\nGiancarlo Stanton hit solo homers in consecutive at-bats for his third multi-homer game of the season and 31st of his career.\nThe Yankees also won their 10th straight home game. It is their first 10-game home winning streak since July 5-23, 2008 at the old Yankee Stadium.\nLuis Severino nearly picked up his sixth win but settled for a no-decision.\nHe allowed two runs and six hits in six-plus innings. Severino also recorded his seventh career double-digit strikeout game by fanning 11.\nIt was his second straight double-digit strikeout game, one shy of his career high.\nAndrew Benintendi, who homered twice off Severino on Aug. 12 in New York, hit an RBI single and Mookie Betts had a game-tying RBI triple off David Robertson.\nBoston’s Drew Pomeranz appeared to sustain a blister early on but stayed in to allow two runs and four hits in six innings.\nRobertson (3-1) kept the game tied and picked up the win.\nChad Green got a diving catch from center fielder Aaron Hicks on a 112.4 mph liner by J.D. Martinez and then got Xander Bogaerts to bounce into a double play in the eighth. Aroldis Chapman hit Jackie Bradley Jr. with two outs in the ninth but retired Christian Vazquez for his eighth save.\nStanton made it 1-0 by lining Pomeranz’s full-count four-seam fastball 372 feet at 111.5 mph down the left line in the second. In his next at-bat, he drove Pomeranz’s 2-1 two-seam fastball 365 feet at 102.1 mph off the bat into the right field seats to make it 2-0 in the fourth.\nThe Red Sox got a run back with two outs in the fifth as Benintendi dropped a single in front of Hicks, scoring Eduardo Nunez, who opened the inning by striking out and reaching on a wild pitch.\nSeverino was lifted after allowing an infield single to Nunez on a 10-pitch at-bat to open the seventh. Robertson was one strike away from ending the inning but allowed Betts to triple to left field.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:34:02.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
