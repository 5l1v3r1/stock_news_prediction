REUTERS/Simon Dawson Matt Hancock, secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, hailed the decision, announced earlier on Thursday, as a major step in combating the “social blight” of problem gambling on the highly addictive machines.\n“We’re going to get on with it. It does take parliament to approve it, so there will be a need to put measures through parliament,” Hancock said during an interview on BBC Radio 4.\n“I’m not going to set out an exact timetable because today we’re announcing the decision. We’re going to work with the industry to make sure that that’s implemented effectively.”\nReporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Kate Holton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:56:12.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
