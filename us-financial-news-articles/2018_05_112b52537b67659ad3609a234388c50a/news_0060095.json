The new watch face features a black background with rainbow stripes appearing vertically, according to 9to5Mac , a news website focused on Apple products and services. The stripes also separate and move when you touch the Apple Watch face screen.\n— itimi (@itimi2) May 30, 2018\nThe watch face was reportedly confirmed via a look at the code for iOS 11.4 and watchOS 4.3.1. You can also get it early by manually changing the date and time to 12 p.m. June 4, though there is a risk of losing some data if you do so.\nLast year, Apple debuted a special rainbow Pride Month watch band. Some of the proceeds also went toward The Trevor Project and GLSEN, two non-profits that help LGBTQ youth, TechCrunch reported.
