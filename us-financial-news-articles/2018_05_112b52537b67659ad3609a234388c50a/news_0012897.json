Martinez also went deep for Boston, which avenged Thursday’s series-opening loss in the four-game set.\nPorcello (5-0) allowed one run and three hits in six innings while winning his seventh straight decision dating to last season. The right-hander struck out eight and walked one as the Red Sox won for the fourth time in the past six games.\nNomar Mazara homered in his fourth straight game for Texas. Mazara, who drove in a career-best five runs on Thursday, had two of Texas’ four hits. Delino DeShields had the other two.\nBetts has five homers over the past three games. He has hit 70 homers in the leadoff spot in the order, breaking the franchise mark set by Dom DiMaggio (69).\nTexas right-hander Bartolo Colon (1-1) served up four solo homers among the five hits he allowed in seven innings. The 44-year-old struck out four and didn’t issue a walk as the Rangers fell for the fourth time in their past six games.\nRight-handers Joe Kelly and Matt Barnes each worked a hitless inning of relief for Boston, and left-hander Bobby Poyner gave up one hit while working a scoreless ninth.\nMartinez began the home run onslaught with a high shot in the second inning that barely cleared the left-field wall.\nMazara got into the act for the Rangers with a tying blast well into the seats in right-center field in the fourth inning.\nDevers led off the fifth inning by clobbering a Colon fastball into the second deck in right field to give the Red Sox a 2-1 lead.\nBetts led off the sixth inning by slugging an 0-2 pitch to left to make it a two-run margin.\nDevers went deep for the second time in the seventh when he deposited an offering from Colon over the wall in right to make it 4-1.\nRamirez delivered an RBI double off Texas left-hander Jake Diekman in the eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:01:26.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
