Additionally, the Company has large land packages at all three mines with several prospective regional targets providing longer term exploration upside and mineral resource growth potential.\nThe Company's Common Shares trade on the Bolsa de Valores de Lima and on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"SMT\" and on the NYSE American Exchange under the symbol \"SMTS\".\nContinue to watch our progress at:\nWeb: www.sierrametals.com\nTwitter: sierrametals\nFacebook: SierraMetalsInc\nLinkedIn: Sierra Metals Inc\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking information\" and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Canadian and U.S. securities laws related to the Company (collectively, \" forward-looking information \"). Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the Company's operations, including anticipated developments in the Company's operations in future periods, the Company's planned exploration activities, the adequacy of the Company's financial resources, and other events or conditions that may occur in the future. Statements concerning mineral reserve and resource estimates may also be considered to constitute forward-looking statements to the extent that they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if and when the properties are developed or further developed. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"projects\", \"estimates\", \"assumes\", \"intends\", \"strategy\", \"goals\", \"objectives\", \"potential\" or variations thereof, or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking information.\nForward-looking information is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual events or results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking information, including, without limitation, risks inherent in the mining industry including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected geological formations, floods, labour disruptions, explosions, cave-ins, weather conditions and criminal activity; commodity price fluctuations; higher operating and/or capital costs; lack of available infrastructure; the possibility that future exploration, development or mining results will not be consistent with the Company's expectations; risks associated with the estimation of mineral resources and the geology, grade and continuity of mineral deposits and the inability to replace reserves; fluctuations in the price of commodities used in the Company's operations; risks related to foreign operations; changes in laws or policies, foreign taxation, delays or the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits; risks relating to outstanding borrowings; issues regarding title to the Company's properties; risks related to environmental regulation; litigation risks; risks related to uninsured hazards; the impact of competition; volatility in the price of the Company's securities; global financial risks; inability to attract or retain qualified employees; potential conflicts of interest; risks related to a controlling group of shareholders; dependence on third parties; differences in U.S. and Canadian reporting of mineral reserves and resources; potential dilutive transactions; foreign currency risks; risks related to business cycles; liquidity risks; reliance on internal control systems; credit risks, including risks related to the Company's compliance with covenants with respect to its BCP Facility; uncertainty of production and cost estimates for the Yauricocha Mine, the Bolivar Mine and the Cusi Mine; and other risks identified in the Company's filings with Canadian securities regulators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which filings are available at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov , respectively.\nThis list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company's forward-looking information. Forward looking information includes statements about the future and are inherently uncertain, and the Company's actual achievements or other future events or conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking information due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. The Company's statements containing forward-looking information are based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management on the date the statements are made, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking information if circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change, other than as required by applicable law. For the reasons set forth above, one should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.\nNote Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates\nAll reserve and resource estimates reported by the Company are calculated in accordance with the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Classification system. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC. The differences between these standards are discussed in our SEC filings. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sierra-metals-to-release-q1-2018-financial-results-on-may-9-2018-300639274.html\nSOURCE Sierra Metals Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/SierraMetalsInc/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sierra-metals-to-release-q1-2018-financial-results-on-may-9-2018-300639274.html", "https://twitter.com/sierrametals?lang=en", "http://www.sierrametals.com/", "http://www.sec.gov/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/sierra-metals-inc-/", "https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=&eventid=1627974&sessionid=1&key=61D76E33DC48C22ECB595CC82024F168&regTag=&sourcepage=register", "http://www.sedar.com/", "https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1627974/61D76E33DC48C22ECB595CC82024F168"], "published": "2018-05-01T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T02:11:08.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
