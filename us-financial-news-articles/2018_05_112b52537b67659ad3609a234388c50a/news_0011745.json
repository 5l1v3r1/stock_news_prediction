That was in line with its own forecast of 400 billion yen, but fell short of a mean estimate of 432 billion yen among 9 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe results were affected by large one-off losses booked in the January-March quarter, including a 29 billion yen impairment loss on its stake in C.P. Pokphand Co. Ltd, a Hong-Kong listed agri-food company.\nFor the year until the end of March, 2019, Itochu predicted a net profit of 450 billion yen, beating a mean estimate of 431 billion yen among 9 analysts.\n$1 = 109.7400 yen Reporting by Yuka Obayashi Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:37:14.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
