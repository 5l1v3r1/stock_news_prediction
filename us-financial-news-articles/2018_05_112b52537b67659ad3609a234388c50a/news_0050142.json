So that was a confusing factor and if confusion was the objective then, hey, there's lots of confusion. Uncertainty that anybody could be next is in the air,\" he said.\nAndrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images The golden domes of the Kremlin's churches and cathedrals sit illuminated at dusk in Moscow, Russia, on Monday, April 9, 2018. Russia is already under sanctions related to its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and perceived role in a pro-Russian uprising in east Ukraine in the same year.\nThe sanctions target any individuals or entities deemed to have been complicit in undermining democratic processes in Ukraine and hit specific sectors, including the arms and energy sectors and financial institutions. The restrictions also prohibit imports and exports of goods to — as well as investment in — Crimea by any U.S. person or entity.\nReacting to the latest sanctions, Rodzianko said that there was no clear rationale for the sanctions.\n\"Emotion has really taken over, unfortunately,\" he said. \"But it works on both sides. We've had the U.S. Congress acting up and all this rhetoric about election interference and then you've got the Russian Duma (Parliament) introducing criminal liability for complying with sanctions that would essentially be a 'scorched-earth' policy for investment in Russia,\" he said.\nThe Duma has not yet passed a law that would make it illegal to comply with Western sanctions on Russian soil but if it did, Rodzianko said it would drive away business.\n\"We hope it doesn't pass but if it does, they'll be doing a much more effective job at sanctioning themselves than the West could ever do,\" he warned.", "external_links": ["https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine.pdf"], "published": "2018-05-24T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:05:15.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
