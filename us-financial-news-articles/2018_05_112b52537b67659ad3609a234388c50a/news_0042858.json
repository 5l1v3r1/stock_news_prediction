Odebrecht said it is still in negotiations with banks.\nFriday is the last day of a 30-day grace period for the repayment of a 500 million-real Odebrecht Engenharia e Construção bond that matured on April 25.\nIf the bond is not repaid, bondholders may declare a default and could trigger early repayment of almost $3 billion of dollar-denominated bonds issued by the Brazilian company.\nAlso on Tuesday, newspaper Valor Economico reported that Odebrecht, which has been implicated in one of Latin America’s largest corruption scandals, had reached a preliminary agreement to pay 2.7 billion reais in damages to federal authorities in Brazil.
