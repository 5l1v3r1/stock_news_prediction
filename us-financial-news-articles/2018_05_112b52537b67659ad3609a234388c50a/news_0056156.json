Highlights of these results are as follows:\nNet income for Q1 2018 was $3.7 million, up from $2.4 million in Q1 2017.\nA drill program to test the Flank Zone area of the DASA deposit was initiated in January 2018, with 7,854 metres drilled in Q1 2018 with excellent results (see press releases dated February 22 nd , April 5 th and May 7 th , 2018).\nCSA Global Pty Ltd. have been engaged to update the DASA resource, incorporating recent drill results and to provide potential mining scenarios.\nExploration drilling to expand the DASA deposit to the southwest and to the northeast is continuing.\nGlobal Atomic continues to work cooperatively with Orano Mines Ltd. (formerly Areva) to evaluate plans to ship DASA material to its nearby mill for processing.\nGlobal Atomic also announced the approval of the expansion and modernization of its electric arc furnace dust (“EAFD”) plant in Iskenderun, Turkey. The project will expand EAFD throughput to 110,000 tonnes per annum, from the current 60,000 tonnes per annum, producing concentrates containing 55 to 65 million pounds of zinc per annum. The new plant has been engineered using the best available technology employed by joint venture partner Befesa Zinc S.A.U. (“Befesa”), a world leader in the processing of EAFD.\nBased on improved plant efficiencies, recovery rates are expected to improve and operating costs reduced. The cost of the project is approximately US $26 million, most of which is subject to a fixed price contract. Site construction is expected to begin in February 2019 and completed by September 2019. Existing cash balances and forecasted cash flow through January 2019, together with available bank lines of credit, should be sufficient to cover capital and other costs through to commissioning of the new plant.\nStephen G. Roman, Chairman, President and CEO of Global Atomic, stated, “We are excited about the current steel market improvements in Turkey and our modernization and expansion plans moving forward. In addition, the exceptional results at the DASA Project suggest this asset could generate significant value as Global Atomic continues with its development.”\nQP Statement\nGeorge A.
