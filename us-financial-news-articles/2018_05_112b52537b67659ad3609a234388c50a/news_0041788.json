Lawmakers seem unlikely to reverse the Federal Communication Commission’s decision to end Obama-era policy, even as major Websites and major companies, including Google and Facebook , go on “red alert” to spur users to voice their support for an open internet.\nAll 49 Senate Democrats appear set to vote for the resolution, as does Republican Susan Collins of Maine. Should it pass the Senate, the resolution would move to the House. Should it somehow clear that hurdle, it will require the signature of President Trump, who has previously shown an inclination to toss the rules out.\nSocial media was full of supporters (some high profile, some less so, but no less passionate) for the Senate bill to pass. Looking forward to seeing the list of who voted how on #NetNeutrality mañana. Good to know who is for sale at the expense of American citizens.

Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on stopping this terrible mistake from becoming reality.
