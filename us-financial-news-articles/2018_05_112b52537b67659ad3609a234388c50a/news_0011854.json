It would also help pay for reforms in countries that want to join the euro.\nTo get the money, a euro zone government or candidate would have to agree with the Commission to deliver on reforms to address economic problems.\n“A structured dialogue between the Commission and the Member State will follow to conclude a reform commitment package, including a detailed set of measures, milestones for implementation, a calendar for completion and financial aspects,” the Commission said.\nThe country would then report every year on the progress of the reforms to get the financing.\nINVESTMENT SUPPORT The European Investment Stabilisation Function would be worth 30 billion euros and provide back-to-back loans from the EU budget. Interest on these loans would be covered by grants.\nThe loans would stabilise investment in countries hit by an economic shock not of their own making.\n“As a shock-absorbing mechanism, the European Investment Stabilisation Function will complement existing instruments at national and European level,” the Commission said.\n“To be effective, it should kick in automatically in the event of large asymmetric shocks, subject to clear eligibility criteria and a triggering mechanism determined in advance, in line with the principles of sound financial and macroeconomic policy,” it said.\nSuch loans would be mainly for euro zone countries, but non-euro zone members of the EU could also be eligible if they contribute to its financing, which would be done via a financial vehicle yet to be established.\n“The grant component could be financed through contributions from euro area Member States equivalent to a share of the profits they make through the production of euro coins (seigniorage),” the Commission said.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Alastair Macdonald and Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:05:54.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
