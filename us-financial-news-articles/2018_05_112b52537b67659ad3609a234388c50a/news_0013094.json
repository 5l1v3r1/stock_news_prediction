The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency’s strength against six others including the euro and Japanese yen, has surged 3.3% since April 16, a recent low.\nIn that time, the dollar has gained 3.2% against the euro and 1.7% versus the Japanese yen, outpacing its 1% advance versus the yuan.\nThe fact that the yuan has depreciated less against the dollar than its major peers means it has strengthened on a trade-weighted basis. The yuan has surged to a two-year high against a basket of its trading partners’ currencies, based on an official gauge’s latest reading on April 27.\nThat China isn’t letting the yuan fall as much against the dollar as the euro or yen suggests Chinese officials are mindful of how their currency policy appears to the Trump administration, said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n“My own gut [feeling], having watched this a while, is that at the moment, the way they’re treating the currency is as a bargaining chip in the negotiations with the Trump administration,” said Mr. Brooks.\nDuring his campaign for the presidency, then-candidate Donald Trump frequently criticized China for its currency policy, alleging Beijing had gained an unfair trade advantage by keeping the yuan undervalued. Mr. Trump said he would officially label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office if elected.\nWhile Mr. Trump hasn’t carried through on that pledge, China remains on a watch list—which also includes countries such as Japan and Switzerland—that the Treasury Department monitors for possible currency manipulation.\nThe yuan doesn’t trade freely. Instead, the Chinese central bank publishes a reference rate for the dollar’s value against the yuan each day, and allows the currency pair to trade 2% above and below that level. On Friday, the yuan strengthened 0.1% against the dollar.\nThe People’s Bank of China has said the reference rate, known as the fix, is based on two factors: the movement of currencies overnight and the dollar’s value against the yuan at the 4:30 p.m. close of currency trading in China.\nMany analysts believe these guidelines still give the central bank plenty of room to use its discretion when setting the yuan’s value. Inferences about what Chinese officials are trying to do with the yuan can have a big impact: Their decision to weaken the yuan sharply in August 2015 spurred fears about Chinese growth that roiled global markets.\nThe yuan’s moves this year have reopened the debate about how China manages its currency. Some, like Mr. Brooks, argue the yuan’s recent depreciation against the dollar has been restrained.\nOthers argue the yuan has been fixed weaker against the dollar by more than they had expected in recent days, based on their own models for the fix. Most of these models typically have errors, since the central bank doesn’t disclose its exact methodology.\nStill, it is unusual to get errors in the same direction—a weaker-than-expected yuan—over consecutive days, as was the case in the eight days through Thursday, according to Ankit Sahni, the New York-based head of research at Exante Data, a firm that analyzes the yuan and global capital flows.\n“The fact that it occurs over several days makes it very likely that something is going on,” he said. “They do seem a little bit keen to target weaker levels of the currency,” he added, referring to Chinese central bankers.\nUltimately, the question is whether China’s currency strategy, which is currently bolstering the yuan against a basket of its peers, will stay in place if growth starts to slow, said Sacha Tihanyi, deputy head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.\n“How long are they willing for this to go on for? We know the best days [for growth] are over,” he said.\nWrite to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T09:55:16.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
