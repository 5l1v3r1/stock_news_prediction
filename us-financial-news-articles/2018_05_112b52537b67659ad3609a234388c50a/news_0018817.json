Dr. Pryer will join Nurix’s executive management team to lead the company’s preclinical, translational and clinical drug development efforts.\n“We are delighted to welcome Dr. Pryer to Nurix,” said Arthur T. Sands, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer of Nurix. “Her extraordinary depth of experience in oncology and drug development broadly will provide great value to Nurix as we advance our breakthrough science into human clinical studies.”\nDr. Pryer joins Nurix from BioMarin Pharmaceutical, where she served as vice president of translational sciences. In that role, she led the company’s efforts in biomarker discovery, bioanalytics, immunogenicity assessment and clinical pharmacology. Prior to joining BioMarin, Dr. Pryer held leadership roles in oncology drug discovery and translational development at Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Raven, SUGEN and Onyx Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Pryer received her Ph.D. in biology from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and completed post-doctoral work in the lab of Dr. Randy Schekman at the University of California, Berkeley.\n“This is an exciting time in the field of protein homeostasis and targeted protein degradation, as years of effort are yielding novel candidate therapeutics for oncology and other unmet medical needs,” said Dr. Pryer. “Throughout my career I’ve been passionate about evaluating drug mechanism of action to develop new therapies for select patient populations. I look forward to working with Arthur and the Nurix team to apply these translational medicine approaches as we move the Nurix pipeline through IND-enabling studies and into the clinic.”\nAbout Nurix\nNurix, Inc. is a leader in the discovery of small molecules that modulate the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) to address significant, unmet medical needs. The UPS is a regulatory pathway that controls protein levels, a function vital to the healthy life of a cell, and presents therapeutic opportunities in multiple disease areas. Nurix was founded by internationally-recognized experts in the ubiquitin proteasome field and is funded by leading life science investors Third Rock Ventures and The Column Group. In September 2015, Nurix and Celgene entered into a broad collaboration targeting protein homeostasis for next-generation therapies in oncology, inflammation and immunology. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
