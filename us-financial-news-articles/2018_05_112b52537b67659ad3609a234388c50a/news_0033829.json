A batch of MLF worth 156 billion yuan was set to expire on the same day.\nThe interest rate for the one-year MLF was unchanged at 3.30 percent, according to the statement.\nThe PBOC said in the same statement that it skipped reverse repos on Monday morning.\nReporting by Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:30:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
