He is also famous in Korea,” Yoo told the news conference, saying it was scary to play a character familiar to millions of people in the former Soviet Union.\n“For them, it’s like me playing Jesus,” he said.\nWith flashes of animation added unexpectedly by Serebrennikov during post-production, and scenes on a train and tram where members of the public break into song, the film has moments of surrealism and, according to Variety’s Guy Lodge, “avoids the bland structural pitfalls of the musical biopic”.\nNot overtly political, the film will get a theatrical release in Russia, but its theme of state censorship and oppression will not go unnoticed as its auteur - who also directs theater and ballet - remains under arrest.\n“This was more of a historical film – talking about the context of that time, not stressing any similarities (with the present),” producer Ilya Stewart said.\n“Although, in my personal opinion, anything Kirill does in his work, whether it’s ballet, theater or any of his film, it’s about today. He speaks about today.”\n“Leto” is one of 21 movies in competition for the Palme d’Or in the festival that runs from May 8 to May 19. 71st Cannes Film Festival – News conference for the film \"Summer\" (Leto) in competition – Cannes, France May 10, 2018.
