Wednesday’s results showed a low single-digit percentage fall.\n“The overall Clairol business is not showing big signs of improvement,” said Pane, as it faces a stagnant beauty market in the U.S. and competition from L’Oreal ( OREP.PA ) and ELF Cosmetics.\nPane said he expects modest organic net revenue growth in the second half of 2018.\nNet loss attributable to Coty Inc narrowed to $77 million or 10 cents per share, from a loss of $164.2 million or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.\nCoty reported a drop of about 73 percent in restructuring costs in the quarter.\nExcluding certain items, the company earned 13 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nSales rose 9.4 percent to $2.22 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $2.17 billion.
