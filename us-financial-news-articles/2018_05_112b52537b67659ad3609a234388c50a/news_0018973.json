We believe the current stock price is undervalued and a strong investment opportunity for the Company,\" said Michael Burdiek, CalAmp's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Furthermore, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to invest in the growth of our business.\"\nUnder the repurchase program, CalAmp may repurchase shares in open-market purchases in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. The extent to which CalAmp repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations, as determined by CalAmp's management team.\nThe Company has approximately 35.8 million shares of common stock outstanding at the present time. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund the repurchases with cash on hand.\nAbout CalAmp\nCalAmp (Nasdaq: CAMP) is a technology solutions pioneer transforming the global connected economy.
