(NASDAQ: OBAS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenues from fixed income real estate totaled $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to revenues of $4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss attributable to Optibase Ltd shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $672,000 or $0.13 per basic and diluted share compared to net loss of $515,000 or $0.10 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2017.\nWeighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation for the periods were approximately 5.2 million basic and diluted shares for each period.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21 million, and shareholders' equity of $78.3 million, compared with $20.3 million, and $77.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nAmir Philips, Chief Executive Officer of Optibase commented on the first quarter results: \"This quarter results are stable compared to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2017 in our fixed income real estate rent and operating income, while our net loss has increased somewhat due mostly to increased Equity share in losses of associates, net. For the first quarter of 2018 we generated NOI of $3.5 million representing a 7% increase over the same period in 2017. In addition, for the first quarter of 2018, our Recurring FFO increased to $740,000 compared to Recurring FFO of $304,000 for the first quarter of 2017.\" Mr. Philips concluded: \"We are working to maintain our basic parameters and to increase our financial stability as we progress through 2018.\"\nACCOUNTING AND OTHER DISCLOSURES\nNon-GAAP Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income, which, to calculate NOI, is adjusted to add back real estate depreciation, and amortization, general and administrative expenses and other operation expenses less gain on sale of operating properties. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe that NOI (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense item that are incurred at the property level.\nWe consider the NOI to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, to understand the core property operations prior to depreciation and amortization expenses and general and administrative costs. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, we consider the NOI to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.\nThe metric NOI should only be considered as supplemental to the metric operating income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. NOI should also not be used as a supplement to, or substitute for, cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States).\nNon-GAAP Funds from operation, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income, which, to calculate FFO, is adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated associates. We make certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Non-GAAP recurring FFO or recurring FFO, to account for items we do not believe are representative of ongoing operating results, including transaction costs associated with acquisitions. We use FFO internally as a performance measure and we believe FFO (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) is a useful, supplemental measure of our operating performance as it's a recognized metric used extensively by the real estate industry. We also believe that Recurring FFO is a useful, supplemental measure of our core operating performance. The company believes that financial analysts, investors and shareholders are better served by the presentation of operating results generated from its FFO and Recurring FFO measures.\nWe consider the FFO and Recurring FFO to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, in analyzing our operating performance.\nThe metric's FFO and Recurring FFO should only be considered as supplemental to the metric net income as a measure of our performance. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, (ii) is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions, (iii) is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, and (iv) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP (Unaudited) Supplemental Financial Data\nA reconciliation of operating income to NOI is as follows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31\nMarch 31\n2018\n2017\n$\n$\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nGAAP Operating income\n1,663\n1,643\nAdjustments:\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n1,097\n1,038\nGeneral and administrative\n776\n626\nNon-GAAP Net Operating Income NOI\n3,536\n3,307\nA reconciliation of net income to FFO and Recurring FFO is as follows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31\nMarch 31\n2018\n2017\n$\n$\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nGAAP Net loss attributable to Optibase LTD\n(672)\n(515)\nAdjustments :\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n1,097\n1,038\nPro-rata share of real estate depreciation and\namortization from unconsolidated associates\n602\n60\nNon-controlling interests share in the above\nadjustments\n(287)\n(279)\nNon-GAAP Funds From Operation (FFO)\n740\n304\nNon-GAAP Recurring Funds From Operation\n(Recurring FFO)\n740\n304\nAmounts in thousands\nAbout Optibase\nOptibase invests in the fixed-income real estate field and currently holds properties and beneficial interest in real-estate assets and projects in Switzerland, Germany and in Texas, Philadelphia, PA and Miami, FL, Chicago, IL, USA and is currently looking for additional real estate investment opportunities.
