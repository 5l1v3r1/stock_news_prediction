REUTERS/Issei Kato\n“The economy is not headed for a recession,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “However, it is clear that in the long term the pace of growth is slowing.”\nWednesday’s data marked the end to eight straight quarters of economic expansion, which was the longest stretch of growth since a 12-quarter run between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989.\nFourth quarter growth was revised to an annualized 0.6 percent, down from the 1.6 percent estimated earlier.\nCapital expenditure fell 0.1 percent, down for the first time in six quarters, suggesting corporate investment is not as strong as many economists had expected. The median estimate was for a 0.4 percent increase.\nThe capital spending figures may presage data due on Thursday that is forecast to show core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, fell in March for the first time in three months.\nConsumer spending fell marginally, registering a decline of less than one percentage point in the first quarter. The median estimate was for consumer spending to remain unchanged.\n“The economy is unlikely to continue to contract further. The global economy is performing well and the yen is trading beyond 110 yen against the dollar, so once exports start to grow again, the economy will return to a moderate growth path,” said\nMaruyama of SMBC Nikko Securities.\nThe first-quarter contraction could make Japanese politicians more reluctant to implement a hike in sales tax to 10 percent from the current 8 percent scheduled for next year.\nA sales tax hike to 5 percent from 3 percent in 2014 caused a large fall in consumer spending and tipped the economy into recession.

And the economic contraction for January-March may support some ruling officials’ call for a delay in a planned sales tax hike,” said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Credit Agricole Securities.
