Despite a 10 percent increase in passengers at Frankfurt in the first three months of the year, the number of shoppers dropped 3 percent, partly due to the security check bottlenecks, Zieschang said.\nRetail revenue per passenger at Frankfurt fell to 3.31 euros in the first quarter from 3.86 euros one year ago, also hit by currency effects and more passengers on short-haul flights, who typically do not shop in duty free.\n$1 = 0.8422 euros Reporting by Victoria Bryan Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:46:32.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
