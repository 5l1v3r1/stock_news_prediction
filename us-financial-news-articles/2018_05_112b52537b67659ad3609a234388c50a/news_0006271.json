Spirit also plans to increase hiring this year.\nThe additional spending to address production problems led Spirit on Wednesday to report a lower-than-expected profit for the first three months of the year.\n“We expect to see overtime decline and a reduction in surge resources (by mid-year),” Spirit CEO Tom Gentile said, indicating it would help the company get back on schedule to supply 737 parts.\nStill, Gentile warned higher freight expenses and other costs would leak into the quarter ending June.\nBoeing is already evaluating options for further increases in production of its medium-haul 737 jet, while Airbus ( AIR.PA ) — Spirit’s second biggest customer — has plans to make more single-aisle A320-family aircraft.\nAlong with first-quarter results, Spirit also announced a $650 million deal to buy European peer Asco Industries NV to boost sales to Airbus.\nSpirit shares rose nearly 4 percent on Wednesday morning after the company also unveiled a $725 million stock buyback plan that followed a 20 percent dividend increase announced last week.\n“The acceleration of the buyback, increase in dividend, strategic M&A transaction and generally confident tone sends all the right signals for the medium-to-long term,” Berenberg analyst Ross Law said.\nSince Spirit spun off from Boeing in 2005, it has gone from being a Boeing factory to making parts for Airbus, Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ), Textron Inc’s ( TXT.N ) Bell Helicopter and Lockheed Martin Corp’s ( LMT.N ) Sikorsky.\nSpirit’s first-quarter profit fell 12 percent to $125.4 million or $1.10 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.35, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue rose about 3 percent to $1.74 billion.\nAdditional reporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:32:23.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
