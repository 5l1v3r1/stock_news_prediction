I felt I drove it pretty decent but I made nothing and the chances I did have I missed them all.\n“It was just a bad week.”\nIn his seventh start of the year, Woods, 42, is well into a full-throttled comeback after last April’s successful back surgery.\nHe seemed to be nearing his old form when he contended for victory in consecutive events in Florida in March, but he stalled with a tie for 32nd at the U.S. Masters, and was even further off the pace at Quail Hollow.\nThe 14-times major champion said he would work on all facets of his game before the Players Championship starts at TPC Sawgrass in Florida on Thursday.\n“I need to do some practice with my putter but I know those greens, know the putts, but you have to hit the ball well there at the TPC,” he said.\n“You can’t get away with hitting it poorly. I’ll still be grinding, because that course does demand everything.” (Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T00:10:44.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
