That incident is just one of several overlapping layers of the Russia inquiry that Mueller and his team are probing.\nA spokesperson for the special counsel declined to comment to The Times.\nThe timeline matters not just to Trump, but to Congressional Republicans under pressure from the electorate.\nPolls suggest Democrats are favored to retake control of Congress in November, amid dissatisfaction with the GOP and a Trump administration mired in controversy. However, that edge in public opinion has narrowed recently, according to a Real Clear Politics average.\nGiuliani's public remarks come as the president has demanded an investigation into whether the FBI placed surveillance on his 2016 campaign â€” and whether such activity was ordered by members of the Obama administration. Trump has repeatedly blasted Mueller's probe as a \"witch hunt\" and insisted there was no collusion, or attempts to obstruct justice.\nThe full New York Times article can be found on its website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T00:03:36.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
