It was not immediately available to comment on Telenet’s letter.\nTelenet’s total shareholder return has declined from 25 percent under previous management to 4 percent under the current CEO and there is a conflict of interest between minority holders and Liberty Global in terms of cash flow leakage to minority holders, Lucerne said in a presentation seen by Reuters.\n“Liberty Global is causing a negative impact on minority shareholder returns and prevents independent directors from safeguarding economic interest of the minority holders,” Lucerne said.\nIn February, Telenet and Nethys signed a five-year partnership agreement to deliver Voomobile offering.\n“If Telenet is not able to allocate incremental capital at attractive returns, the company should lower capex to boost”, Lucerne said in the presentation.\nCable and mobile operators across Europe are joining forces to offer TV, mobile and internet services as one big bundle, which makes customers less likely to switch.
