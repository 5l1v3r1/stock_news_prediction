It was Paxton’s second career complete game and second in his past three starts.\nJean Segura and Ben Gamel hit home runs for the Mariners.\nSegura opened the scoring in the first inning with a home run, his third of the season, to center field off Tigers right-hander Mike Fiers (4-3).\nThe Tigers tied it in the top of the second as Victor Martinez led off with a homer to left field, his fourth.\nGamel led off the bottom of the inning with his first homer of the season. The Mariners added another run on Segura’s two-out triple, scoring Mike Zunino from third after an infield single, throwing error and sacrifice bunt, to make it 3-1.\nThe Tigers got one run back in the fifth as John Hicks led off with a double to right and Niko Goodrum chopped a ball off the plate for an infield single. Hicks scored on Grayson Greiner’s sacrifice fly.\nThe Mariners pulled away with four runs in the sixth.\nKyle Seager led off with a walk, prompting Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire to replace Fiers with Artie Lewicki. Ryon Healy greeted the right-hander with a single to center, sending Seager to second. An out later, Zunino hit a soft liner to right field, scoring Seager. A walk to Guillermo Heredia loaded the bases.\nWith the infield drawn in, Dee Gordon hit a hard one-hopper up the middle that glanced off Lewicki’s glove and ricocheted past second baseman Dixon Machado and into shallow right field. By the time right fielder Nicholas Castellanos was able to retrieve the ball and get it back into the infield, Gordon was sliding into second base with a two-run double. Segura’s sacrifice fly to right field scored the final run of the inning, making it 7-2.\nFiers allowed four runs on six hits in five-plus innings, with one walk and two strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-20T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:37:01.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
