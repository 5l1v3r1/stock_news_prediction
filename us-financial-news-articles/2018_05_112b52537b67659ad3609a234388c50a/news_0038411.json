REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nThe sale of 15.8 million shares would generate about $1.32 billion, based on Hilton’s Thursday close at $83.30.\nHilton said on Friday it will not receive any proceeds from the sale and would repurchase about 1.3 million shares from the shareholders affiliated to Blackstone.\nBlackstone, which took the Virginia-based company public in 2013, started shedding its stake a year later.\nIn June and November 2014, Blackstone raised $2.33 billion and $2.59 billion, respectively, from stock sales that progressively reduced its stake in Hilton.\nBlackstone cut its stake to under 50 percent in a $2.69 billion stock sale in 2015, which was then termed as the biggest ever selldown by a private equity sponsor through a block trade.\nBlackstone usually buys hotels and other real estate holdings at a discount, fixes them and sells for a profit. The private equity firm had taken Hilton private in a $26 billion leveraged buyout in 2007.\nIn 2016, Blackstone agreed to sell a 25 percent stake in Hilton to China’s HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] for $6.5 billion, three times what it paid in 2007.\nHNA, the heavily indebted aviation-to-financials conglomerate, sold the stake about a year and a half later as part of its plan to shed assets and tackle a cash crunch.\nUp to Thursday’s close, Hilton’s shares had risen about 36 percent in the last year. They were nearly flat at $83.35 in premarket trading on Friday.
