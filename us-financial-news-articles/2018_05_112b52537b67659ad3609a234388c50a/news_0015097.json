Excluding the impact of the 2017 divestitures and discontinuations of $214 million and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $66 million, revenue grew organically 2 by 2% compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by growth in the Salix business and the Bausch + Lomb/International segment. Organic 2 revenue growth was partially offset by declines in the Ortho Dermatologics business and lower volumes in the U.S. Diversified Products segment, attributed to the previously reported loss of exclusivity for a basket of products.\nRevenues by segment for the first quarter of 2018 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n1Q 2018\n1Q 2017 4\nReported\nChange\nReported\nChange\nChange at\nConstant\nCurrency 5\nOrganic 2\nChange\nSegment\nBausch + Lomb/International\n$1,103\n$1,134\n($31)\n(3%)\n(8%)\n2%\nBranded Rx\n$593\n$629\n($36)\n(6%)\n(6%)\n8%\nU.S. Diversified Products\n$299\n$346\n($47)\n(14%)\n(14%)\n(9%)\nTotal Revenues\n$1,995\n$2,109\n($114)\n(5%)\n(9%)\n2%\nBausch + Lomb/International Segment\nBausch + Lomb/International segment revenues were $1.103 billion for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $1.134 billion for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $31 million, or 3%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and discontinuations of $113 million, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $65 million, the Bausch + Lomb/International segment grew organically 2 by approximately 2% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nBranded Rx Segment\nBranded Rx segment revenues were $593 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $629 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $36 million, or 6%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and discontinuations of $83 million and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1 million, the Branded Rx segment grew organically 2 by approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, the Salix business grew revenue by 40%, largely driven by sales growth in XIFAXAN ® and other promoted products.\nU.S. Diversified Products Segment\nU.S. Diversified Products segment revenues were $299 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $346 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $47 million, or 14%. The decline was primarily driven by decreases attributed to the previously reported loss of exclusivity for a basket of products and by the impact of the 2017 divestitures and discontinuations of $18 million.\nOperating Loss\nOperating loss was $2.281 billion for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to an operating income of $211 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $2.492 billion. The decrease in operating of 2018 primarily reflects goodwill impairment charges of $2.213 billion related to the Salix and Ortho Dermatologics businesses. These charges were recognized when the Company adopted new accounting guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board in January 2018.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2.693 billion, as compared to net income of $628 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $3.321 billion. The decrease in net income is primarily attributed to a decrease in the benefit from income taxes and the goodwill impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Net income in the first quarter of 2017 included an income tax benefit of $908 million from a non-cash internal restructuring in that quarter.\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 was $312 million, as compared to $273 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 14%.\nOperating Cash\nThe Company delivered $438 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2018, which was above expectations due to reductions in working capital and despite settlement payments of $170 million that were made in the first quarter for certain legacy legal matters, including the SOLODYN ® Antitrust Class Actions and Allergan Shareholder Class Actions.\nCash flow in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $516 million, as compared to $954 million in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 included a one-time cash receipt attributed to our fulfillment agreement with Walgreens.\nEPS\nGAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) Diluted for the first quarter of 2018 was $(7.68), as compared to $1.79 for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $832 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $861 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $29 million, primarily driven by the impact of the 2017 divestitures of $75 million, offset by growth in the Salix business.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nValeant has raised guidance for the full year of 2018 and has not changed anticipated dates for products losing exclusivity (LOE) later this year:\nFull-Year Revenues in the range of $8.15 – $8.35 billion from $8.10 – $8.30 billion Full-Year Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) in the range of $3.15 – $3.30 billion from $3.05 – $3.20 billion\nOther than with respect to GAAP Revenues, the Company only provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to GAAP net income (loss), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. In periods where significant acquisitions or divestitures are not expected, the Company believes it might have a basis for forecasting the GAAP equivalent for certain costs, such as amortization, which would otherwise be treated as non-GAAP to calculate projected GAAP net income (loss). However, because other deductions (such as restructuring, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt and litigation and other matters) used to calculate projected net income (loss) vary dramatically based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast on a GAAP basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a GAAP calculation of projected net income (loss) at this time. The amount of these deductions may be material and, therefore, could result in projected GAAP net income (loss) being materially less than projected Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP). The guidance provided in this section represents forward-looking information, and actual results may vary. Please see the risks and assumptions referred to in the Forward-looking Statements section of this news release.\nAdditional Highlights\nValeant's were $909 million at March 31, 2018 The Company's availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $1.1 billion at March 31, 2018\nConference Call Details\nDate:\nTuesday, May 8, 2018\nTime:\n8:00 a.m. EDT\nWeb cast:\nhttp://ir.valeant.com/events-and-presentations\nParticipant Event Dial-in:\n(844) 428-3520 (North America)\n(409) 767-8386 (International)\nParticipant Passcode:\n6185877\nReplay Dial-in:\n(855) 859-2056 (North America)\n(404) 537-3406 (International)\nReplay Passcode:\n6185877 (replay available until July 8, 2018)\nAbout Valeant\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

Valeant undertakes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect actual outcomes, unless required by law.\nNon-GAAP Information\nTo supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures including (i) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), (ii) organic growth and (iii) constant currency. As discussed below, we also provide Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) to provide supplemental information to readers. Management uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics in the evaluation of company performance and the consolidated financial results and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our Company. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions the Company routinely receives from analysts and investors, and in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data, the Company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors.\nHowever, these measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP nor do they have any standardized meaning under GAAP. In addition, other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. They should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe reconciliations of these historic non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below. However, as indicated above, for guidance purposes, the Company does not provide reconciliations of projected Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to projected GAAP net income (loss), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations.\nSpecific Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is GAAP net income (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) adjusted for certain items, as further described below. Management of the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), along with the GAAP measures used by management, most appropriately reflect how the Company measures the business internally and sets operational goals and incentives, especially in light of the Company's new strategies. In particular, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) focuses management on the Company's underlying operational results and business performance. As a result, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) both to assess the actual financial performance of the Company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is a useful measure to evaluate current performance. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors. In addition, commencing in 2017, cash bonuses for the Company's executive officers and other key employees are based, in part, on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) targets.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nRestructuring and integration costs: Since 2016 and for the foreseeable future, while the Company has undertaken fewer acquisitions, the Company has incurred additional restructuring costs as it implements its new strategies, which will involve, among other things, improvements to our infrastructure and other operational improvements, internal reorganizations and impacts from the divestiture of assets and businesses. With regard to infrastructure and operational improvements which the Company has taken to improve efficiencies in the businesses and facilities, these tend to be costs intended to right size the business or organization that fluctuate significantly between periods in amount, size and timing, depending on the improvement project, reorganization or transaction. As a result, the Company does not believe that such costs (and their impact) are truly representative of the underlying business. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items provide supplemental information with regard to the sustainability of the Company's operating performance, allow for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance and, as a result, provide useful supplemental information to investors. Acquired in-process research and development costs: The Company has excluded expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development, as these amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing, size and nature of acquisitions. Furthermore, as these amounts are associated with research and development acquired, they are not a representation of the Company's research and development efforts during the period. Asset Impairments: The Company has excluded the impact of impairments of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as impairments of assets held for sale, as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the Company's operating performance. Although the Company excludes intangible impairments from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Share-based Compensation: The Company excludes the impact of costs relating to share-based compensation. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense assists investors in the comparisons of operating results to peer companies. Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. Acquisition- related adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets and depreciation expense: The Company has excluded the impact of acquisition-related contingent consideration non-cash adjustments due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates, and the amount and frequency of such adjustments is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of the Company's acquisitions, as well as the nature of the agreed-upon consideration. In addition, the Company has excluded the impact of fair value inventory step-up resulting from acquisitions as the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of its acquisitions. Loss on extinguishment of debt: The Company has excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a cost of refinancing our existing debt and is not a reflection of our operations for the period. Further, the amount and frequency of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions and other factors in the debt market out of management's control. Other Non-GAAP Charges: The Company has excluded certain other amounts, including legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with recent legal and governmental proceedings, investigations and information requests respecting certain of our distribution, marketing, pricing, disclosure and accounting practices, litigation and other matters, and net (gain)/loss on sale of assets. In addition, the Company has excluded certain other expenses that are the result of other, non-comparable events to measure operating performance. These events arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Given the unique nature of the matters relating to these costs, the Company believes these items are not normal operating expenses. For example, legal settlements and judgments vary significantly, in their nature, size and frequency, and, due to this volatility, the Company believes the costs associated with legal settlements and judgments are not normal operating expenses. In addition, as opposed to more ordinary course matters, the Company considers that each of the recent proceedings, investigations and information requests, given their nature and frequency, are outside of the ordinary course and relate to unique circumstances. The Company believes that the exclusion of such out-of-the-ordinary-course amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the financial results of the Company from period to period and, therefore, provides useful supplemental information to investors. However, investors should understand that many of these costs could recur and that companies in our industry often face litigation.\nFinally, to the extent not already adjusted for above, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) reflects adjustments for interest, taxes, (EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, ).\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (non-GAAP)\nHistorically, management has used adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for which is GAAP net income (loss)) for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance. This non-GAAP measure excludes the impact of certain items (as further described below) that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance. By disclosing this non-GAAP measure, it was management's intention to provide investors with a meaningful, supplemental comparison of the Company's operating results and trends for the periods presented. It was management's belief that this measure was also useful to investors as such measure allowed investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same tools that management had used to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. Accordingly, it was the Company's belief that adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) was useful to investors in their assessment of the Company's operating performance and the valuation of the Company. It is also noted that, in recent periods, our GAAP net income was significantly lower than our adjusted net income (non-GAAP). Commencing in 2017, management of the Company identified and began using certain new primary financial performance measures to assess the Company's financial performance. However, management still believes that adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) may be useful to investors in their assessment of the Company and its performance.\nIn addition to certain of the adjustments described above (namely restructuring and integration costs, acquired in-process research and development costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, acquisition-related adjustments, excluding amortization, and other non-GAAP charges), adjusted net income (non-GAAP) also reflects adjustments based on the following additional items:\nAmortization of intangible assets: The Company has excluded the impact of amortization of intangible assets, as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the Company's operating performance. Although the Company excludes amortization of intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.\nOrganic Growth\nOrganic Growth, a non-GAAP metric, is defined as an increase on a period-over-period basis in revenues on a constant currency basis (if applicable) excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations. Organic Growth is growth in GAAP Revenue (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) adjusted for certain items, as further described below, of businesses that have been owned for one or more years. The Company uses organic revenue and organic growth to assess performance of its business units and operating and reportable segments, and the Company in total, without the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations and recent acquisitions, divestitures and product discontinuations. The Company believes that such measures are useful to investors as it provides a supplemental period-to-period comparison.\nOrganic revenue growth reflects adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues and (ii) the revenues associated with acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations of businesses divested and/ or discontinued. These adjustments are determined as follows:\nForeign currency exchange rates: Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates are part of our business, they are not within management's control. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business. The impact for changes in foreign currency exchange rates is determined as the difference in the current period reported revenues at their current period currency exchange rates and the current period reported revenues revalued using the monthly average currency exchange rates during the comparable prior period. Acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations: In order to present period-over-period organic revenues (non-GAAP) on a comparable basis, revenues associated with acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations are adjusted to include only revenues from those businesses and assets owned during both periods. Accordingly, organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth excludes from the current period, revenues attributable to each acquisition for twelve months subsequent to the day of acquisition, as there are no revenues from those businesses and assets included in the comparable prior period. Organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth excludes from the prior period (but not the current period), all revenues attributable to each divestiture and discontinuance during the twelve months prior to the day of divestiture or discontinuance, as there are no revenues from those businesses and assets included in the comparable current period.\nConstant Currency\nChanges in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar may affect the Company's financial results and financial position. To assist investors in evaluating the Company's performance, we have adjusted for foreign currency effects. Constant currency impact is determined by comparing 2018 reported amounts adjusted to exclude currency impact, calculated using 2017 monthly average exchange rates, to the actual 2017 reported amounts.\nPlease also see the reconciliation tables below for further information as to how these non-GAAP measures are calculated for the periods presented.\n1\nPlease see the tables at the end of this news release for a reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure.\n2\nOrganic growth, a non-GAAP metric, is defined as an increase on a period-over-period basis in revenues on a constant currency basis (if applicable) excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations.\n3\nProvisional name\n4\nEffective in the first quarter of 2018, revenues from the U.S. Solta business included in the U.S. Diversified Products segment in prior periods and revenues from the international Solta business included in the Bausch + Lomb/International segment in prior periods are presented in the Branded Rx segment. Prior period presentations of segment revenues have been conformed to the current segment reporting structure to allow investors to evaluate results between periods on a constant basis. Global Solta revenue was $29 million and $23 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n5\nTo assist investors in evaluating the Company's performance, we have adjusted for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Change at constant currency, a non-GAAP metric, is determined by comparing 2018 reported amounts adjusted to exclude currency impact, calculated using 2017 monthly average exchange rates, to the actual 2017 reported amounts.\nFINANCIAL TABLES FOLLOW\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.\nTable 1\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Three and

For additional information about the Company's use of such non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the body of the press release to which these tables are attached. Organic revenue (non-GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is calculated as revenue as reported adjusted for the impact for changes in exchange rates (previously defined in this press release). Organic revenue (non-GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is calculated as revenue as reported less revenues attributable to divestitures and discontinuances during the twelve months prior to the day of divestiture or discontinuance, as there are no revenues from those businesses and assets included in the comparable current period. Organic revenue is also adjusted for acquisitions, however, during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no acquisitions.\n(c)\nAs of the third quarter of 2017, one product has been removed from the Global Surgical business unit and added to the International Rx business unit. This change has been made as management believes that the product better aligns with the International Rx business unit, as this product, although acquired as part of the acquisition of certain surgical assets, is an injectable product. Prior period presentations of business unit revenue have been conformed to the current business unit reporting structure to allow investors to evaluate results between period on a consistent basis.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
