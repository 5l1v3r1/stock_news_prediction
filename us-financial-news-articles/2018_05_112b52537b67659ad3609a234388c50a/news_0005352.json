The company’s stock is on track for its greatest weekly percentage gain since October 2011.\nThe S&P 500 technology sector was up 1.9 percent, the biggest gainer on the index.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 355.42 points, or 1.49 percent, to 24,285.57, the S&P 500 gained 36.16 points, or 1.38 percent, to 2,665.89 and the Nasdaq Composite added 125.21 points, or 1.77 percent, to 7,213.36.\nAt the market open, U.S. stocks had moved lower upon the release of employment data. The S&P 500 bounced off its 200-day moving average, a technical level that indicates the long-term trend.\nThe Labor Department reported the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent.\nBut U.S. stocks climbed as the session progressed. Investors said that the low unemployment figure, which on its own might point to inflationary pressure on wages, offset the mere 0.1-percent rise in wages for April, below expectations.\n“The report might have taken some time to digest,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “The focus moved to the lack of wage inflation versus the drop in the unemployment rate.”\n“That’s what’s behind the rally today,” he said.\nAll the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, and 29 of the 30 Dow members were in the black.\nPandora Media Inc shares jumped 22.4 percent after the music-streaming service provider reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.\nShares of CBS Corp rose 7.6 percent after the media company topped revenue and profit estimates for the first quarter.\nFluor Corp shares sank 22.4 percent, the most on the S&P, after the engineering and construction company posted a surprise quarterly loss due to issues with a gas-fired power project.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.10-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 43 new lows.
