Abcam said it had announced the news to try to force Horizon to talk.\nAbcam said that combining Horizon’s capabilities in gene editing with its own products would allow both to extend their reach and influence globally, in the latest attempt at consolidation in the pharmaceutical sector.\nBoth firms are based in Cambridge, England, a center for medical research and home to a string of biotech and pharmaceutical companies.\nBut Abcam said on Wednesday it had decided not to make an offer due to Horizon’s rejection and after considering the most recent results of its bid target.\n($1 = 0.7373 pounds)\nReporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Paul Sandle and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:36:28.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
