If finalised, it would go to the country’s health ministry for approval before being published, he added.\nThe agency tightened rules for clinical research a few years ago after cases emerged of some patients being enrolled into trials without informed consent, and not being adequately compensated.\nThe new rules would let the ‘ethics committees’ – groups of medical experts – that oversee clinical trials decide on the level of compensation for patients who suffer adverse events, Chandrashekhar said.\nTougher compensation rules could turn the industry away from conducting trials at a time when companies have been gradually looking back to India for clinical work, warned D.G. Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents large Indian drugmakers.\n“There has been some revival (of clinical research) based on some assurances given by the government and simplifications (of rules),” Shah said. But if compensation rules are adopted as mentioned in the draft released by the CDSCO, companies “will run away from here,” he said.\n“This is not conducive to doing innovation and research in India,” Shah said.\nAs part of overhauling drug regulations in the country, the CDSCO is also planning to bring in new rules for the sale of over-the-counter drugs, and e-pharmacies in the coming months, Chandrashekhar said.
