The currency has declined 0.25 percent so far this month after a 1.5 percent fall in April. It has fallen 3 percent so far this year.\nThe pressure on the currency is unwarranted as gross external reserves are at $9.1 billion and the real effective exchange rate indexes indicate that the currency is competitive, the central bank had said.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 457 million rupees ($2.89 million) in the week ended May 23, bringing the outflow so far this year to 16.2 billion rupees, central bank data showed.
