Readiness for deployment - both physical and mental - has been seen as one of many potential factors influencing soldiers’ suicide risk.\nIn the current study, most of the soldiers were male and white, with at least a high school education when they joined the military. Most of them were also under 21 years old at enlistment and married.\nOverall, the researchers calculated that early deployment contributed 14 percent of a soldier’s suicide risk and having less than six months between deployments accounted for 4 percent of the risk.\nIndeed, most of the attempted suicide cases, 72 percent, occurred among soldiers who had been in the service for at least 13 months before their first deployment, the researchers note.\nAnd slightly more than half of the cases happened among soldiers whose first deployments lasted at least nine months.\nThe duration of soldiers’ first deployment, however, didn’t appear to influence their risk of attempted suicide.\nOne limitation of the study is that researchers relied on administrative data on suicide attempts and mental health care, and it’s possible some cases might be missing from these records, the study authors note.\nResults from the analysis of suicide attempts between 2004 and 2009 also may not reflect the experiences of soldiers who deployed at other times. The study also doesn’t look at suicide deaths.\n“Whether or not there is a history of deployment, the strongest link to suicidal behavior has consistently been the presence of one or more underlying mental disorders,” said Dr. Charles Hoge, a staff psychiatrist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, who wasn’t involved in the study.\nStill, the results might serve as a guide in the military for planning deployment rotation cycles to support soldiers’ mental health, Hoge said by email.\nThe findings also highlight a need to help soldiers maintain healthy relationships with friends and family so they have a support system to help them cope with their experiences in the military, said Alan Peterson of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\nThis is particularly true for younger soldiers whose brains are still developing, Peterson, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.\n“Most neuroscientists believe that human brain continues to mature and develop until age 25 to 30,” Peterson said. “Brain changes may occur in soldiers who deploy within the first 12 months of entry onto active duty that reduce their capacity to cope across the deployment cycle.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2k3cF5y JAMA Psychiatry, online April 18, 2018.", "external_links": ["https://bit.ly/2k3cF5y"], "published": "2018-05-16T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:11:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
