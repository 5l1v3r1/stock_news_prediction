The suspect, also a boy, was detained off campus by officers, who recovered a rifle, according to the department.\nDeputies responded to Highland High School in Palmdale, about 60 miles (97 km) north of Los Angeles, at around 7 a.m. (1400 GMT) after receiving multiple reports of an armed person on campus.\nThe initial reports of a possible school shooting drew immediate attention from major news outlets and cable TV networks.
