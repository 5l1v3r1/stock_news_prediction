And most recent commentary seems to be that after all the bluster, he may only partially withdraw from the deal,” said Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.\nAt 9:52 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 70.79 points, or 0.29 percent, at 24,286.53, the S&P 500 was down 8.95 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,663.68 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 29.00 points, or 0.40 percent, at 7,236.22.\n“Depending on the magnitude of energy markets being affected, it could spillover to the rest of equities in general,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\nAmong stocks, Comcast fell 2.3 percent after Reuters reported the cable operator is preparing to make an all-cash offer for media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox has agreed to sell to Disney for $52 billion.\nDisney, which is due to report its results after markets close, was down 0.8 percent. Fox’s shares rose 1.5 percent.\nThe S&P consumer discretionary index was down 0.4 percent.\nCitigroup advanced 2.2 percent after activist investor ValueAct invested $1.2 billion in the bank, citing its low risk and reliable revenue. The stock’s gain helped the S&P financial index to be the only gainer among the major 11 indexes.\nDish Network dipped 0.1 percent after its quarterly revenue came below expectations due to a drop in its legacy pay-TV subscriptions.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.11-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 50 new highs and 21 new lows.
