Danielle asked that the news outlet not use her last name.\nIn an interview with KIRO, Amazon said the issue was “very, very rare.” According to an Amazon spokesperson, the device was triggered to record and send the audio by background noise. Here is the company’s official statement:\nEcho woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like “Alexa.” Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a “send message” request. At which point, Alexa said out loud “To whom?” At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, “[contact name], right?” Alexa then interpreted background conversation as “right”. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.\nDanielle, who immediately unplugged all her Amazon Alexa devices, has requested a refund for her Amazon Alexa devices, reports KIRO.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.kiro7.com/www.kiro7.com/news/local/woman-says-her-amazon-device-recorded-private-conversation-sent-it-out-to-random-contact/755507974", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143"], "published": "2018-05-25T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:54:38.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
