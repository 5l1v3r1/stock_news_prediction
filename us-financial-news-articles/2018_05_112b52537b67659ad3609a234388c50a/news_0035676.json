Leveraged finance bankers are preparing financing based on an adjusted Ebitda figure of €120m.\nAn enterprise value of 13 to 15 times adjusted Ebitda would value the company at €1.56bn to €1.8bn, the sources said. Mehilainen reported underlying Ebitda of €92.8m for 2017, based on revenues of €755.5m.\nThe deal will add to a strong pipeline of European leveraged loans which includes buyout loans for other healthcare companies, such as an €880m equivalent first lien and €275m second lien financing for Zentiva, formerly Sanofi’s generics business.\nTriton Capital carved Mehilainen out of parent company Ambea Group, following its initial €850m joint investment in Ambea with KKR in 2010.\nMehilainen merged with peer Mediverkko in February 2015, creating a group with 140 hospitals and care homes throughout Finland. Finnish pension funds Imarinen and Varma are co-owners of Mehilainen.\nCarlyle, CVC and Nordic Capital declined to comment. Triton could not be reached for comment.
