Washington’s second-leading scorer in 2017 decided to remain overseas with a primary focus on the Belgium national team.\nHer absence allows Delle Donne to shift back to her natural power forward slot.\nCurrie, who played with Washington from 2008-2014, re-signed with the Mystics this offseason to bolster the frontcourt.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T00:11:29.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
