EPA chief Scott Pruitt is facing about a dozen investigations into issues including his travel and security detail costs and his rental of a Capitol Hill condo linked to an energy lobbyist for just $50 a night.\nAn early investigation into Trump's EPA found that the agency violated the law by installing a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in Pruitt's office without seeking approval from Congress.\nNow, the Hill reports that EPA spent at least $9,600 to decorate Pruitt's office. Federal agencies are allowed to spend up to $5,000 for that purpose, after which they must seek approval from Congress before authorizing further expenses.\nThe costs include $1,950 in moving costs for artwork loaned to EPA by the Smithsonian Institution, $2,500 for framing and roughly $5,000 to purchase one desk and refurbish another.\nshow chapters EPA watchdog opens probe into Pruitt condo rental 6:40 PM ET Fri, 27 April 2018 | 00:55 An EPA spokesperson told the Hill that EPA actually only spent $4,984.06. The spokesperson, Jahan Wilcox, arrived at that total after subtracting the refurbished desk, which he said was offered by the Office of Administration and Resource Management and two framed certificates that he claimed qualify as gifts given to administrators. The tally also omits an American flag worth more than $900 and the cost of moving one of the paintings, both of which occupy a lobby.\nHowever, Kevin Chmielewski, a former EPA staffer, told the Hill that the lobby is actually a waiting area in Pruitt's executive suite. He also claimed he arranged the framing himself and said Pruitt had promised to reimburse the agency for a framed photo with Trump.\nChmielewski, a former Trump campaign aide, detailed some of the decorating costs in a list of allegations against the EPA after allegedly being fired for questioning Pruitt's spending habits.\nSeparately, an online survey conducted by HarrisX for Axios showed that more than a third of Americans are somewhat aware of scandals involving Pruitt. Meanwhile, 16 percent said they are very familiar, and 48 percent said they are not at all familiar.\nFour-fifths of respondents said Pruitt should lose his job if EPA's inspector general concludes he abused his power.\nRead the Hill story here .\nWatch: Embattled EPA chief Scott Pruitt tripped up in Senate testimony over security request show chapters Embattled EPA chief Scott Pruitt tripped up in Senate testimony over security request 5:52 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 02:24", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:15:53.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
