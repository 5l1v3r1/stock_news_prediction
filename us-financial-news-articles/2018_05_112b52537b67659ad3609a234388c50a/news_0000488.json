First quarter results and recent highlights include:\nNet income of $7.9 million; adjusted net income of $11.1 million, a 47% increase over first quarter 2017 adjusted net income. The company completed the sale of 50% of the ownership interests in Superior Pipeline Company LLC (Superior) to SP Investor Holdings, LLC for cash consideration of $300 million. The effective date of the sale was April 1st. Termination of the At-The-Market common stock program initiated in February 2017. Oil and natural gas segment placed its third drilling rig into service in mid-January and its fourth rig into service during March. Proceeds from the sale of non-core oil and natural gas assets were $21.7 million. Contract drilling segment constructing its 11 th BOSS drilling rig under long-term contract. Midstream segment operating profit increased 11% over the fourth quarter of 2017. April redetermination of Unit’s borrowing base amount resulted in a decrease from $475 million to $425 million due to the sale of the 50% interest in Superior and the release of Superior as a borrower and co-obligor under the credit agreement.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nUnit recorded net income of $7.9 million for the quarter, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $15.9 million, or $0.31 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income (which excludes the effect of non-cash commodity derivatives) for the quarter was $11.1 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as compared to $0.15 per diluted share for the same quarter for 2017, a 40% increase (see Non-GAAP financial measures below). Total revenues for the quarter were $205.1 million (50% oil and natural gas, 23% contract drilling, and 27% midstream), compared to $175.7 million (50% oil and natural gas, 21% contract drilling, and 29% midstream) for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $89.1 million, or $1.71 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP financial measures below).\nMIDSTREAM TRANSACTION\nOn April 3, 2018, Unit closed the sale of fifty percent (50%) interest in its wholly owned midstream subsidiary, Superior, to SP Investor Holdings, LLC, which is jointly owned by OPTrust and funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group, a global private markets investment manager. The cash proceeds at closing were $300 million. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the outstanding amount under the company's credit agreement. The balance will be used to accelerate the drilling program of Unit’s upstream subsidiary, make additional capital investments in the now jointly owned midstream subsidiary, and for general corporate purposes.\nLarry Pinkston, Unit’s Chief Executive Officer and President, said: “Our goal has been to grow the cash flow of our midstream segment to maximize the segment’s value. With the association of our new partners, we believe we are now in a better position to accelerate the realization of that goal. Unit will continue to serve as managing partner of the segment and continue to reap a portion of the synergies from having Superior as part of our corporate economics. The transaction also highlighted the current value of Superior. The sale was also beneficial to Unit in other ways. We were able to pay the entire outstanding balance on our bank credit facility, which, following our most recent redetermination, now provides for a $425 million borrowing base, all of which is available for future use, if needed. The available amount of our borrowing base, coupled with the cash on hand, positions Unit with the liquidity necessary to carry out its focus on growing all of its segments. We intend to accelerate the growth within our oil and natural gas segment by adding another drilling rig later this year to its well drilling program. But in doing so, consistent with our practice, we will be deliberate with our capital spending, focusing on maximizing the value received for the capital expended.”\nTERMINATION OF AT-THE-MARKET COMMON STOCK PROGRAM\nBecause of the liquidity created by the Superior transaction, Unit has elected to terminate the At-The-Market Common Stock Program initiated in February 2017. Under that program, the company could offer and sell, occasionally, shares of its common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $100.0 million. To date under the program, Unit sold 787,547 shares of its common stock resulting in proceeds of approximately $18.6 million.\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nFor the quarter, per day equivalent production was 46.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBoe), a decrease of less than 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) production represented 46% of total equivalent production. Oil production was 8,178 barrels per day, an increase of 4% over the fourth quarter of 2017. NGLs production was 13,275 barrels per day, a decrease of 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Natural gas production was 150 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day, a decrease of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017. The slight decrease in daily production from fourth quarter 2017 to first quarter 2018 was due to the timing of completions on a multi-well pad in the Texas Panhandle and a two-week delay in drilling operations in the Gulf Coast area.\nUnit’s average realized per barrel equivalent price for the quarter was $24.18, a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Unit’s average natural gas price was $2.62 per Mcf, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Unit’s average oil price was $55.10 per barrel, an increase of 1% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Unit’s average NGLs price was $21.08 per barrel, a decrease of 4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. All prices in this paragraph include the effects of derivative contracts.\nIn the Wilcox area, Unit continued its exploration and recompletion programs during the quarter. In the Wing prospect area, the Wing #18 was drilled and completed in the BP Fee \"C\" sand, resulting in a successful discovery of a new pay interval. Unit is currently drilling the Wing #20 to further delineate this discovery. Unit's first exploration well in the Cherry Creek prospect area, the Trinity #1 well, has continued to perform well, and the company will drill its first Cherry Creek delineation well later in the second quarter. Also, eight recompletions and two workover wells were completed throughout the Wilcox play during the quarter.\nIn the Buffalo Wallow area of the Granite Wash, Unit continued its \"C1\" zone development efforts. The Francis three-well pad was drilled and completed and started first sales in February. The wells continue to clean up and are expected to meet or exceed the \"C1\" type curve. The Carr three-well pad was drilled and completed in late March and the wells are in the early flowback stages. Unit will possibly add an additional rig later this year.\nIn the Southern Oklahoma Hoxbar Oil Trend (SOHOT) area, during the quarter, Unit completed three new Marchand horizontal wells, the Schenk Trust #1-17HXL, with an IP30 of 2,318 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, the McConnell #1-11H with an IP30 of 1,426 Boe per day, and the Livingston Land #1-33/4, which is in the early stages of clean up. Unit’s plan is to continue running one rig throughout the remainder of the year.\nIn western Oklahoma, Unit spud its initial well in the STACK play, the Irwin #1-4H, in Dewey County, Oklahoma during March and also participated in seven non-operated wells during the first quarter.\nPinkston said: “Our oil and natural gas segment placed its third drilling rig into service in mid-January and its fourth rig into service during March. Our focus on drilling and completing multi-well pads results in an uneven production growth profile. Our well results continue to meet or exceed expectations. Our production guidance remains unchanged, with 2018 production anticipated to grow to 17.1 to 17.4 MMBoe, or 7% to 9% year over year from 2017. During the quarter, we sold non-core oil and natural gas assets, net of related expenses, for $21.7 million.\"\nThis table illustrates certain comparative production, realized prices, and operating profit for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nChange Mar 31,\n2018\nDec 31,\n2017\nChange Oil and NGLs Production, MBbl 1,931 1,740 11 % 1,931 1,986 (3 )% Natural Gas Production, Bcf 13.5 12.2 10 % 13.5 13.9 (3 )% Production, MBoe 4,181 3,777 11 % 4,181 4,310 (3 )% Production, MBoe/day 46.5 42.0 11 % 46.5 46.8 (1 )% Avg.

CONTRACT DRILLING SEGMENT INFORMATION\nUnit's average number of drilling rigs working during the quarter was 31.7, an increase of 2% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Per day drilling rig rates averaged $17,038, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Average per day operating margin for the quarter was $5,179 (before elimination of intercompany drilling rig profit of $0.4 million). This margin compares to first quarter 2017 average operating margin of $3,474 (before elimination of intercompany drilling rig profit of $0.6 million), an increase of 49%, or $1,705.\nPinkston said: “Our contract drilling segment continues to show solid results. The BOSS rig continues to set new performance records for several operators. We were able to negotiate a new long-term contract for our 11 th BOSS rig, which is under construction. All 10 of our BOSS rigs are under contract, and we currently have a total of 32 drilling rigs operating. Long-term contracts (contracts with original terms ranging from six months to two years in length) are in place for six of our drilling rigs. Of the six contracts, one is up for renewal in the second quarter of 2018, two in the third quarter, two in the fourth quarter and one in 2019.”\nThis table illustrates certain comparative results for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nChange Mar 31,\n2018\nDec 31,\n2017\nChange Rigs Utilized 31.7 25.5 24 % 31.7 31.2 2 % Operating Profit Before Depreciation (MM) (1) $ 14.3 $ 8.0 80 % $ 14.3 $ 15.3 (6 )%\n(1) Unit calculates operating profit before depreciation by taking operating revenues for this segment less operating expenses excluding depreciation and impairment.

On April 2, 2018, Unit signed a Fourth Amendment to its credit agreement in connection with its sale of the 50% ownership interest in Superior. One condition of the sale was the release of Superior from the credit agreement. The Fourth Amendment also provides for, among other things, a maximum credit amount, a borrowing base, and an elected commitment all of $425 million. The sale transaction closed on April 3rd, and the outstanding borrowings on the credit facility were paid that same day.\nWEBCAST\nUnit uses its website to disclose material nonpublic information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.
