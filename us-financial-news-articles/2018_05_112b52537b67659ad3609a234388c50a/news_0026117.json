Fees rose 12 percent from the last three months of 2017.\nThe bank, which on Thursday said it had completed a landmark 24 billion euro bad loan sale, said it had kicked off a process to offload up to another 4.5 billion euros in impaired debts this year. $1 = 0.8393 euros Reporting by Valentina Za Editing by Mark Bendeich", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T09:13:23.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
