(\"Espial\" or the \"Company\"), (TSX:ESP), today announced its first quarter financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\nRecent Highlights\nFirst quarter revenue was $5.9 million ($6.3 million, including adjustments due to IFRS 15). Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) subscription revenue from Espial’s Elevate SaaS video platform for the quarter was $1.2 million; a 13% sequential increase from Q4 2017. First quarter adjusted EBITDA 1 was a loss of $1.7 million ($1.3 million, including adjustments due to IFRS 15). Net loss was $3.7 million. A North American cable company with over 1 million subscribers selected Elevate SaaS video platform. Buckeye Broadband, a leading provider of high-speed internet, digital TV and telephone services to customers across northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan selected Espial’s Elevate SaaS video platform. Spanish Fork Community Network (SFCN) a leading operator in Utah providing television, broadband and voice services selected Espial’s Elevate SaaS video platform. Ellijay Telephone Company (ETC), a leading operator in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee providing television, broadband, voice and security services selected Espial’s Elevate SaaS video platform.\n“We continued to make good progress on our evolution to a SaaS software company. In Q1, we added new wins for our multi-tenant Elevate SaaS video platform and grew our recurring subscription revenue by 13% on a sequential basis. We also consolidated our global engineering operations to focus investments on next generation IP and cloud solutions, while reducing costs to improve profitability” said Jaison Dolvane, CEO, Espial. “Pay TV operators continue to have concerns over their ability to innovate in an increasingly competitive industry, but have been slow to adopt next- generation platforms due to long, expensive integration timelines. Espial’s Elevate helps PayTV operators reduce time and risk to launch new services, rapidly innovate and respond to industry changes.”\nThe Company adopted IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition. The Company applied IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method and has recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at January 1, 2018. The impact of the change on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated statement of loss was:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\nAs reported\nAdjustments\nBalances without\nadoption of IFRS 15\nRevenue $ 5,932,257 396,175 $ 6,328,432 Sales and marketing expense $ 1,634,894 24,879 $ 1,610,015 Ebitda 1 $ (1,740,749) 421,054 $ (1,319,695) Net loss $ (3,736,385) 421,054 $ (3,315,331) Financial Summary\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, revenue was $5.9 million compared with revenue of $8.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

We use Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. We believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets and assess our ability to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized, defined or standardized measure under IFRS. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA will likely differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for or in isolation from measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Investors are encouraged to review our financial statements and disclosures in their entirety and are cautioned not to put undue reliance on non-IFRS measures and view them in conjunction with the most comparable IFRS financial measures. We have reconciled Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable IFRS financial measure as follows:\nThree Months Ended 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (3,736,385) $ (1,799,947) Add (less) Share-based compensation 348,972 432,486 Amortization of intangibles 175,267 182,879 Depreciation 123,964 99,831 Business restructuring 1,873,793 - Interest income (101,686) (62,544) Other (income) expense (461,230) 82,996 Income tax 36,556 77,117 Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,740,749) $ (987,182) Consolidated Statements of Loss and\nComprehensive Loss\n(In Canadian dollars)\nThree Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Revenue Software $ 2,024,498 $ 5,025,351 Software subscription 1,166,843 - Professional services 906,072 1,585,934 Support and maintenance 1,834,844 2,052,725 Total revenue 5,932,257 8,664,010 Cost of revenue 1,726,937 2,236,021 Gross margin 4,205,320 6,427,989 Expenses Sales and marketing 1,634,894 1,655,158 General and administrative 867,934 1,006,700 Research and development 3,916,177 5,285,630 Amortization of intangible assets 175,267 182,879 Business restructuring 1,873,793 - 8,468,065 8,130,367 Loss before other income (expense) (4,262,745) (1,702,378) Other income (expense) 461,230 (82,996) Interest income 101,686 62,544 Loss before taxes (3,699,829) (1,722,830) Income taxes (36,556) (77,117) Net loss (3,736,385) (1,799,947) Other comprehensive loss: Foreign currency translation\ndifferences –foreign operations\n(235,627) - Comprehensive loss $ (3,972,012) $ (1,799,947) Loss per common share - basic $ (0.10) $ (0.05) Loss per common share – diluted $ (0.10) $ (0.05) Weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding - basic\n35,917,607 36,540,333 Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In Canadian Dollars)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nCURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,933,015 $ 38,813,911 Accounts receivable 7,559,762 6,792,420 Investment tax credits receivable 989,880 924,630 Prepaid expenses and other assets 998,312 841,617 44,480,969 47,372,578 Property plant and equipment 1,888,266 2,046,905 Intangible assets 951,919 941,187 Goodwill 3,632,604 3,632,604 $ 50,953,758 $ 53,993,274 CURRENT LIABILITIES Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 3,281,079 $ 4,778,111 Provisions 711,054 - Deferred revenue 4,214,394 3,345,828 8,123,939 6,931,441 Provisions 100,422 - Total Liabilities 8,306,949 8,123,939 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Share capital 123,573,929 123,738,952 Share based payments reserve 17,528,887 17,179,915 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (235,627) - Deficit (98,220,380) (95,049,532) 42,646,809 45,869,335 $ 50,953,758 $ 53,993,274 Statements of Cash Flows\n(In Canadian Dollars)\nThree Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING Net loss $ (3,736,385) $ (1,799,947) Items not affecting cash Depreciation of property and equipment 123,852 99,831 Amortization of intangible assets 175,085 182,879 Share-based compensation expense 348,972 432,486 Business restructuring provisions 920,307 - Provisions - (62,565) (2,168,169) (1,147,316) Changes in non-cash operating\nworking capital items\n(1,485,261) 420,045 (3,653,430) (727,271) INVESTING Purchase of equipment (63,980) (145,743) Purchase of intangibles (185,997) - (249,977) (145,743) FINANCING Options exercised 8,550 6,183 Share repurchase program (173,573) (473,233) (165,023) (467,050) Net cash and cash equivalents outflow (4,068,430) (1,340,064) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 38,813,911 43,047,878 Effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 187,534 - Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 34,933,015 $ 41,707,814 Supplementary information: Taxes paid $ 36,556 $ 77,117 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure.
