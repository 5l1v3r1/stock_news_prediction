Currently, Uber is still able to operate in Britain's capital.\nPierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, vice president and regional general manager of Uber in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said that Heywood would bring a \"wide-range of international experience in both regulated industries and scaling fast-growing businesses\" to the ride-hailing giant.\n\"Jamie's leadership will also be crucial as we implement major changes across Europe including more safety features, improvements for drivers and a new approach to partnering with cities,\" Gore-Coty said in a statement Monday.\nChallenges in Europe Uber faces a number of challenges to how it operates across Europe.\nTfL holds that Uber failed to meet regulatory requirements when it comes to reporting serious criminal offences involving drivers and obtaining checks on drivers. Earlier this year, Uber introduced a number of safety measures in the U.K., including reporting serious incidents to the police and providing private hire vehicle licensing details to users.\nLast year, Uber lost an appeal on its classification of drivers as self-employed, after a U.K. judge ruled that drivers should be treated as formal workers of the company. The ruling was seen as a test for the so-called gig economy, where self-employment and freelancing work is becoming prevalent.\nMeanwhile, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled later that year that Uber is a transportation firm rather than a digital company, and that it should be regulated as such.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:05:34.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
