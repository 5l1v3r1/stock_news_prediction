Its shares shot up nearly 30 percent at one point on news of the deal, before it pared gains.\nIn addition to the potential merger, M&R proposed to redeem Aveng’s outstanding convertible bonds maturing in 2019 early by amending the terms and conditions. If implemented, settlement of the bonds will be at par value 2 billion rand plus accrued interest.\nThis will be funded from a combination of new financing facilities of 1.8 billion rand and available cash resources.\nBy 1445 GMT, shares in Aveng had reversed gains and were down 1.10 percent, while Murray & Roberts’ shares reversed losses and traded up 2.3 percent.
