But it has been on hold since amid uncertainty about the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and concern about how indebted consumers will handle higher rates.\nWith the bank noting trade policy uncertainty is dampening global business investment, economists said policymakers were unlikely to raise rates in quick succession.\n“There’s no indication here that it’s prepared to move at consecutive meetings. We likely would not see the next move after July until October,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.\nThe bank said inflation will likely be a bit higher in the near term than forecast in April, largely because of increases in gasoline prices, though it noted it will look through the transitory impact of gas price fluctuations.\nThe bank said data since April support its outlook for economic growth around 2 percent in the first half of 2018, with exports of goods more robust than forecast, while housing remained soft into the second quarter.\nThe bank also said there is some upside to the outlook for the U.S. economy, while the price of oil, a key Canadian export, has been higher than assumed in April.
