A similar meeting took place in Rome with American bishops in 2002 during the papacy of Pope John Paul after a sexual abuse crisis exploded in the United States.\nChurch leaders in Chile have also called for a “drastic solution” to the long-running scandal, including resignations and dismissals.\nReporting by Antonio de la Jara; Writing by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T23:16:00.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
