The worldwide legal marijuana market is expected to generate revenue worth $146.4 billion by end of 2025, according to California-based market consultancy by Grand View Research.\n\"(Aurora is) targeting mostly Europe for exports ... the demand is firmly in place, in terms of their medical market,\" said Alan Brochstein, founder of cannabis-industry information provider 420 Investor.\n\"(Europe has) perhaps a better program initially in terms of insurance coverage and distribution through pharmacies,\" he added.\nThe acquisition is Aurora's second large deal this year, coming just months after it bought CanniMed Therapeutics for C$1.1 billion.\nShares of Aurora and MedReleaf each rose 1 percent on Monday morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nAurora shareholders will own about 61 percent of the combined company, following the all-stock deal. Aurora offered to buy each MedReleaf share for C$29.44, representing an 18.2 percent premium to MedReleaf's Friday closing price.\nAurora would likely sign more deals, but not any as big as the MedReleaf acquisition, Booth said at a media conference in Toronto. The company would also consider listing its shares in New York, he added.\n\"Aurora has ... been pretty aggressive with their expansion plans but now shareholders will want to see those assets being put to use before the company rushes out and buys something else,\" said Bruce Campbell, chief investment officer at Cannabis Growth Opportunity Corp.\n($1 = 1.2767 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by John Benny and Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Sai Sachin Ravikumar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:49:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
