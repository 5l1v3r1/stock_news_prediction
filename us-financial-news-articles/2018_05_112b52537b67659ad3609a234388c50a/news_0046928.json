Egypt does not allow international media to travel to North Sinai to report.\nThe military spokesman said residents affected by the creation of the buffer zones have been properly compensated.\n“The value of the compensations has reached 900 million pounds ($50.4 million). This in addition to the essential goods and medical and administrative needs that the armed forces provide to citizens in areas of operations,” the statement said.\nCritics say Egypt’s use of conventional military might against militants who have hidden out for years in Sinai is unlikely to clear them from the vast rugged region, which lies on the Red Sea between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba and is separated from mainland Egypt by the Suez Canal.\nDefeat of Islamist militants and restoring stability is one of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s main pledges as he begins a second term.\nEgypt’s 2011 popular uprising, which toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak, was followed by years of violent political upheaval that severely damaged Egypt’s economy.\nReporting by John Davison; editing by Sami Aboudi and Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:43:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
