Commenting on these results, Ted Doheny, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “In the first three months of the year, Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% and 13%, respectively. Business momentum continued with growth across the global protein and e-Commerce markets as well as our recent acquisition of Fagerdala in Asia. We executed on our strategy by reducing costs, driving operational excellence and commercializing new innovations. Our performance in Q1, combined with favorable global business trends, gives us confidence in our 2018 outlook.”\nUnless otherwise stated, all results compare first quarter 2018 results to first quarter 2017 results from continuing operations. Year-over-year financial discussions present operating results from continuing operations as reported, and on a constant dollar basis. Constant dollar refers to unit volume and price/mix performance and excludes the impact of currency translation from all periods referenced. Additionally, non-U.S. GAAP adjusted financial measures, such as Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) and Adjusted Tax Rate, exclude the impact of specified items (“Special Items”), such as restructuring charges, charges related to the sale of Diversey, gains and losses related to acquisition and divestiture of businesses, special tax items (“Tax Special Items”) and certain other infrequent or one-time items. Please refer to the supplemental information included with this press release for a reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP to U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nBusiness Highlights\nTo accelerate productivity improvements and elimination of operational redundancies, the Company implemented a change in allocation of Corporate expenses. These expenses are now allocated to Food Care and Product Care segments. For comparison purposes, the Company presented 2017 results to reflect the revised allocation of these costs. This segment reporting change has no impact on total Company Adjusted EBITDA.\nFood Care first quarter net sales of $696 million increased 6% as reported. Currency had a positive impact on Food Care net sales of 3%, or $20 million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased 3% due to 8% growth in Latin America and 4% in North America and EMEA. This was offset by a 3% decline in Asia Pacific. Incorporating the segment change described above, Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $135 million or 19.3% of net sales. Year-over-year margin expansion of 70 basis points was primarily attributable to volume trends, restructuring savings and favorable foreign currency partially offset by higher raw material and freight costs.\nProduct Care first quarter net sales of $435 million increased 15% as reported. Currency had a positive impact on Product Care net sales of 4%, or $15 million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased 11%, including $21 million from Fagerdala. Constant dollar growth was driven by an increase of 8% in North America, 3% in EMEA and 44% in Asia Pacific. Incorporating the segment change discussed above, Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% to $78 million or 18.0% of net sales. Year-over-year margin expansion of 120 basis points was primarily attributable to profitable volume growth and restructuring savings partially offset by higher raw material and freight costs.\nFrom January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2018, Sealed Air repurchased approximately $426 million or 9.3 million shares through a combination of open market repurchases and the completion of an Accelerated Share Repurchase program. Additionally, Sealed Air’s Board of Directors reset the Company’s share repurchase program authorization on May 2, 2018, to $1 billion, continuing its commitment to return value to shareholders. This new program has no expiration date and replaces the previous authorizations, representing an increase of nearly $500 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 U.S. GAAP Summary\nNet sales of $1.1 billion increased 10% on an as reported basis. Currency had a positive impact on total net sales of 4%, or $36 million. As reported, net sales increased across all regions.\nNet loss from continuing operations on an as reported basis was $208 million, or $(1.25) per diluted share, as compared to $54 million, or $(0.27) per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017. Net loss in the first quarter 2018 was unfavorably impacted by $293 million of special items, primarily related to $290 million of provisional tax expense for one-time tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings pursuant to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\"). Net income in the first quarter 2017 was unfavorably impacted by $139 million of special items, including $127 million of tax expense recorded relating to the sale of Diversey as well as restructuring and other restructuring associated costs.\nThe effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted a provisional tax expense related to the one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings pursuant to the TCJA. This one-time expense was $290 million resulting in an effective tax rate for the quarter of 283.3%, compared to 164.9% in the first quarter of 2017. The 2017 rate was negatively affected by tax expense related to the sale of Diversey.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Non-U.S. GAAP Summary\nNet sales on a constant dollar basis increased 6% with positive sales trends in all regions. On constant dollar basis, net sales increased 5% in North America, 4% in EMEA, 8% in Latin America and 11% in Asia Pacific.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2018 was $205 million, or 18.1% of net sales, compared to $182 million, or 17.6% of net sales 2017. The year-over-year margin increase of 50 basis points was attributable to positive volume trends and cost reductions.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.51 for the first quarter 2018 compared to $0.43 in the first quarter 2017. The Adjusted Tax Rate was 30.3% in the first quarter 2018, compared to 13.6% in the first quarter 2017. The 2017 rate was favorably impacted by $9 million of tax benefit on share-based compensation and $5 million of tax benefit related to statute of limitation expirations and audit settlements.\nCash Flow and Net Debt\nCash flow provided by operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was an outflow of $34 million, which includes the previously announced one-time payment in lieu of future royalty payments and $14 million of payments related to the sale of Diversey and efforts to address related stranded costs.\nCapital expenditures were $43 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey and efforts to address related stranded costs, was an outflow of $63 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company had a cash outflow of $312 million related to share repurchases, and paid cash dividends of $28 million.\nNet Debt, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, increased to $3.1 billion as of March 31, 2018 from $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. This increase resulted from a use of working capital and amounts paid for share repurchases.\nReaffirmed Outlook for Full Year 2018\nFor the full year 2018, the Company reaffirms its previously provided outlook for Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. The Company anticipates Net Sales to be in the range of approximately $4.75 to $4.80 billion, a constant dollar growth rate of approximately 4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $890 million to $910 million. Currency is expected to have a favorable impact of approximately $110 million on Net Sales and $20 million on Adjusted EBITDA. The Company increased its forecast for Adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.55 from $2.35 to $2.45 to reflect year-to-date share repurchases. The revised forecast is based on estimated average diluted shares outstanding of 162 million compared to the previous guidance of 169 million average diluted shares outstanding.\nThe outlook for Free Cash Flow continues to be approximately $400 million, assuming capital expenditures of approximately $160 million and cash restructuring payments of approximately $20 million, which excludes restructuring payments of $30 million to address related stranded costs.\nConference Call Information\nDate: Thursday, May 3, 2018 Time: 10:00 a.m. (ET) Webcast: www.sealedair.com/investors\nConference Dial In: (855) 472-5411 (domestic) (330) 863-3389 (international) Participant Code: 8876525 A supplemental presentation will be available on the Company’s website at www.sealedair.com/investors .\nConference Call Replay Information\nDate: Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. (ET) through Saturday, June 2, 2018 at 12:59 p.m. (ET) Webcast: www.sealedair.com/investors\nConference Dial In: (855) 859-2056 (domestic) (404) 537-3406 (international) Participant Code: 8876525 Business\nSealed Air Corporation is a knowledge-based company focused on packaging solutions that help our customers achieve their sustainability goals in the face of today’s biggest social and environmental challenges.

Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this document.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Information\nIn this press release and supplement, we have included several non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including Net Debt, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS, net sales on a “constant dollar” basis, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Tax Rate, as our management believes these measures are useful to investors. We present results and guidance, adjusted to exclude the effects of Special Items and their related tax impact that would otherwise be included under U.S. GAAP, to aid in comparisons with other periods or prior guidance. In addition, non-U.S. GAAP measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and, along with other data, as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts, assessing financial performance, providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers and may also be used for purposes of determining incentive compensation. The non-U.S. GAAP information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP information. It does not purport to represent any similarly titled U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under U.S. GAAP. Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we present may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by others.

These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

(2) EMEA consists of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Turkey. (3) APAC refers collectively to our Asia Pacific region. This region consists of i) Greater China, ii) India/Southeast Asia and iii) Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea. (4) Our price/mix reported above includes the net impact of our pricing actions and rebates as well as the period-to-period change in the mix of products sold. Also included in our reported price/mix is the net effect of some of our customers purchasing our products in non-U.S. dollar or euro-denominated countries at selling prices denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. This primarily arises when we export products from the U.S. and euro-zone countries. (5) Total constant dollar change is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. It is important that we consider the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when our management looks at our financial results to measure the core performance of our business, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to our investors.
