We ask for your understanding. We ask for your help,” the Hawaii Civil Defense Agency said in an alert.\nKilauea started spewing fountains of lava as high as 300 feet (90 meters) into the air on Thursday. Walls of molten rock destroyed houses in the southeastern corner of the island as deadly volcanic gases rose through cracks in the earth.\nAround 1,700 people have already been ordered to leave their properties. No deaths or major injuries have been reported. But two new fissures - the 13th and 14th - formed on Tuesday and started releasing toxic gases, the agency said.\nA total of 36 structures have been torched by the lava, which can reach temperatures of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,093 degrees Celsius).

Apau Hawaii Tours/Social Media via REUTERS\nLava has been bubbling out of about 2-1/2 miles (4 km) of fissures that officials have warned are slowly spreading eastwards.\nOn Friday, the southeastern corner of the island was rocked by a powerful magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the volcano’s south flank, the strongest since 1975, and more quakes and eruptions have been forecast, perhaps for months to come.\nKilauea has been in a state of nearly constant eruption since 1983.\nGRAPHIC: Hawaii's Kilauea volcano - tmsnrt.rs/2rmXdVZ Slideshow (3 Images)\n(This version of the story makes changes to “Hawaii residents” in paragraph one.)
