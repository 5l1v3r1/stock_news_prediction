Trials against some lung cancers and kidney cancer have produced recent, important wins, but difficult-to-treat CRC proved elusive.\nBarclays Capital analysts, who rate Roche shares “overweight”, called the failure a disappointment but said CRC was always seen as a higher-risk opportunity, with only modest expectations of the indication adding significantly to sales.\nRoche, which is weathering patent losses on its best selling medicines Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin that open the market to copies, is looking for Tecentriq to make up ground to Merck’s Keytruda and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb.\nEach has more than ten times the quarterly sales of Tecentriq which were 139 million Swiss francs ($138 million) in the first three months of 2018.\nTecentriq is also facing an increasingly crowded market for checkpoint inhibitors, amid a fast expanding field of cancer drugs as more and more companies focus on what is one of medicine’s most-lucrative markets.\nBeyond Opdivo and Keytruda, there are two other so-called PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors on the market: AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi, Pfizer and Merck KGaA’s Bavencio. These could soon to be joined by a sixth, with Regeneron’s and Sanofi’s cemiplimab under review in the United States and Europe.\nThere are also molecules under development in China by companies like Beigene Ltd.\nMoreover, Novartis has similar checkpoint inhibitors in the works as part of plans to have its own medicines to be used in combination therapies seen likely to dominate the next phase of cancer treatment.
