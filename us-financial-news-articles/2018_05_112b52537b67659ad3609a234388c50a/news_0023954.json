(the “ Company ” or “ Crystal ”) (TSX-V:CEI) (OTCQB:CYRTF) (FWB:A2ATHU) – further to the Company’s announcement on March 22, 2018, Crystal is pleased to announce that it has increased the required financing for the Lawyers Property, BC, from $3.0 million to $3.21 million.\nThe Company now proposes to complete a non-brokered private placement of 53,500,000 units (the “ Units ”) at an offering price of $0.06 per Unit, to raise gross proceeds of up to $3.21 million (the “ Offering ”). Each Unit will consist of one (1) common share of the Company as the share capital is presently constituted, and one (1) share purchase warrant (the “ Warrants ”) to acquire one additional common share at an exercise price of $0.12 per share for a period of two (2) years from the date of closing of the Offering. In the event that the common shares of the Company trade at a closing price greater than $0.14 per share for a period of 10 consecutive days, then the Company may deliver a notice to the Warrant holders that they must exercise their Warrants within the next 30 days, or the Warrants will expire. The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to finance the minimum expenditures on the Property over the next 12 months, as well as to provide the Company with working capital for general and administrative expenses. The terms of the Offering are subject to the acceptance of the Exchange. Certain finders will receive finders’ fees equal to 6% in cash and 6% in Warrants of the gross proceeds raised from their introductions.\nShare Consolidation\nThe Company is also proceeding with a special meeting of its shareholders to be held on May 22, 2018 to consider, and if thought fit, to approve a 3:1 share consolidation of the Company’s common shares by ordinary resolution (the “ Consolidation ”). Assuming the proposed Offering is completed and the Consolidation is approved, the effective consolidation-adjusted terms of the Offering will be 17,833,333 Units issued, each Unit consisting of one common share at a price of $0.18 and one Warrant with an exercise price of $0.36 per share, with closing prices greater than $0.42 per share for 10 consecutive days triggering the Company’s right to require Warrant holders to exercise within 30 days. Upon completion of the Offering and the Consolidation, but excluding the exercise of any of Crystal’s outstanding share purchase warrants or any other share issuances, the Company will have about 33,306,538 shares outstanding.\nAbout Crystal Exploration Inc.\nCrystal is a Canadian gold, silver and diamond Exploration Company with its common shares listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, the OTCQB Venture Market in the United States and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Germany.
