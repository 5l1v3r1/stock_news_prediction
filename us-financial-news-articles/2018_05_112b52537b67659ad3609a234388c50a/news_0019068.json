REUTERS/Juda Ngwenya/File Photo The demands far exceed the current inflation rate of 3.8 percent and suggest potentially tough negotiations with companies that have been battling to contain soaring costs in the world’s deepest mines.\nThe document, dated April 23, says the NUM wants the basic monthly pay for entry-level underground workers to rise to 10,500 rand ($83) over the next two years, which translates into annual increases of between 15 and 18.5 percent, depending on the company.\nThis is less than opening demands of up to 75 percent by the NUM in previous negotiations, a sign that lower inflation and food prices may be moderating expectations. The three-year agreements reached in 2015 saw basic wage hikes of between 10 and 13 percent per year.\nThe total package a miner receives is higher than the basic wage as it also includes housing and other allowances.\nThe chamber negotiates in the gold sector on behalf of Harmony Gold, Sibanye-Stillwater, AngloGold Ashanti, and a smaller producer.\nWages account for around half of the costs in South Africa’s gold mining industry and companies have in the past said the cycle of double-digit, above-inflation pay hikes cannot be sustained, unless prices rise considerably.\nUnions say wages remain too low, a legacy of apartheid when the black mining labour force was ruthlessly exploited. The NUM has also said its average member typically has eight dependants, straining their ability to provide for their households and fueling their demands.\nNegotiations should kick off in June and other unions still have to submit their demands, but the NUM said it wanted the talks to be complete by July 1, when the next agreements are supposed to begin.\n($1 = 12.6043 rand)\nEditing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:29:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
