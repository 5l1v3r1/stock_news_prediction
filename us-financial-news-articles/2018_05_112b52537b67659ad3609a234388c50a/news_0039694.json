(Nasdaq:IFRX), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapeutics to treat life-threatening inflammatory diseases by targeting the complement system, a key component of the innate immune system, reported financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“During the first quarter, we initiated an international Phase IIb clinical trial with our lead product, IFX-1, in Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) and we are currently preparing to start a Phase II clinical trial in ANCA Associated Vasculitis (AAV) until the third quarter of 2018,” said Arnd Christ, Chief Financial Officer of InflaRx. “More recently, we successfully completed a follow-on financing in May 2018, which allows us to further accelerate our strategy and expand our clinical pipeline into additional inflammatory indications.”\nCorporate Highlights\nOn January 9, 2018, InflaRx received IND acceptance to proceed with a Phase IIb trial with lead candidate IFX-1 in Hidradenitis Suppurativa. On February 6, 2018, InflaRx appointed Tony Gibney to its Board of Directors. Mr. Gibney has 23 years of experience as a life sciences-focused investment banker at Leerink Partners, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. On March 8, 2018, InflaRx enrolled the first patient in its Phase IIb trial with IFX-1 in Hidradenitis Suppurativa. On May 8, 2018, InflaRx closed a primary and secondary offering of 3,450,000 common shares, consisting of 1,850,000 common shares offered by InflaRx and 1,600,000 common shares offered by the selling shareholders at price to the public of $34.00 per common share for total gross proceeds of $117.3 million, consisting of total gross proceeds to InflaRx of $62.9 million and total gross proceeds to the selling shareholders of $54.4 million, which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights\nCash and cash equivalents totaled €115.2 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to €27.9 million as of March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the completion of InflaRx’s initial public offering of common shares in November 2017, the exercised green shoe in December 2017, and the primary portion of the Series D financing executed in October 2017.\nNet cash flow from operations increased from €2.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to €5.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 mainly due to the increase of cash expenses, such as third-party expenses for manufacturing and clinical trials for our lead program IFX-1 and personnel-related expenses.\nResearch and development expenses incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased over the corresponding period in 2017 by €3.1 million. This increase is primarily due to a €1.9 million increase in CRO and CMO expenses associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted for IFX-1 and a €1.2 million increase in employee-related costs caused by higher expenses associated with non-cash stock-based compensation, principally from equity award grants under our Stock Option Plans 2016 and 2017, respectively (€0.8 million increase).\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by €2.4 million to €3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from €0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase is primarily due to a €1.7 million increase in employee-related costs associated with non-cash stock-based compensation, principally from equity award grants under our Stock Option Plans 2016 and 2017, respectively increased by €1.4 million. This €0.5 million increase in legal, consulting and audit fees is mainly attributable to costs of being a publicly listed company, as well as tax services.\nFinance costs (net) increased by €1.1 million to €1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from €0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Such increase is primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses of our USD term deposits (€2.2 million). This was partially offset by costs such as interest in connection with preferred shares (€0.8 million) in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Preferred shares were converted into common shares in connection with the initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was €10.3 million or €0.4 per common share, compared to €3.8 million or €1.6 per common share for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdditional information regarding these results is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2018.\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiaries Unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, in € thousand 2017 2018 Other income and expenses (net) 28 70 Research and development expenses (2,401 ) (5,474 ) General and administrative expenses (615 ) (3,005 ) Loss before interest and income taxes (2,987 ) (8,409 ) Finance income 0 265 Finance costs (813 ) (2,188 ) Finance costs (net) (813 ) (1,924 ) Loss for the period (3,800 ) (10,333 ) Other comprehensive loss for the period 0 0 Total comprehensive loss (3,799 ) (10,332 ) Loss per common share in € (basic/diluted) (1.6 ) (0.4 )\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiaries Condensed consolidated statements of financial position in € thousand 31.12.2017 31.03.2018 unaudited ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 41 39 Laboratory and office equipment 173 245 Financial assets 20 56 Total non-current assets 233 340 Current assets Other assets 697 654 Cash and cash equivalents 123,282 115,240 Total current assets 123,979 115,893 Total assets 124,212 116,233 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Equity Issued capital 2,858 2,858 Other reserves 167,864 170,802 Accumulated deficit (51,293 ) (61,625 ) Total equity 119,429 112,034 Non-current liabilities Deferred income 15 14 Provisions 2 2 Total non-current liabilities 17 16 Current liabilities Trade payables 4,464 3,133 Other liabilities, provisions 302 1,050 Total current liabilities 4,766 4,183 Total equity and liabilities 124,212 116,233\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiaries Unaudited Condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity Other reserves in € thousand Issued\ncapital Capital\nreserve currency\ntranslation share-\nbased\npayments Accumulated\ndeficit Own\nshares Total\nequity Balance as of January 1, 2017 31 0 9 1,675 (27,055 ) (350 ) (25,690 ) Comprehensive loss Loss for the period (3,800 ) (3,800 ) Total comprehensive loss 0 0 0 0 (3,800 ) 0 (3,800 ) Recognition of equity-settled share-based payments 710 710 Balance as of March 31, 2017 31 0 9 2,385 (30,854 ) (350 ) (28,779 ) Balance as of January 1, 2018 2,858 161,639 0 6,225 (51,293 ) 0 119,429 Comprehensive loss Loss for the period (10,333 ) (10,333 ) Exchange differences 0 0 Total comprehensive loss 0 0 0 0 (10,333 ) 0 (10,332 ) Recognition of equity-settled share-based payments 2,937 2,937 Balance as of March 31, 2018 2,859 161,639 0 9,163 (61,625 ) 0 112,034\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiaries Unaudited Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, in € thousand 2017\n2018 Cash flow from Operations Loss before income taxes (3,800 ) (10,333 ) Reconciliation from result before taxes to net cash flows Depreciation/amortization of intangible assets, laboratory and office equipment 10 22 Share based payment expense 710 2,938 Finance Income 0 (265 ) Finance costs 813 2,188 other non-cash adjustments (4 ) (25 ) Change in Provisions and Government Grants 697 977 Working capital adjustments Change in Trade payables and other liabilities (1,225 ) (1,561 ) Change in other assets 73 43 Interest received 0 265 Cash flow from Operations (2,727 ) (5,751 ) Cash flow from investing activities Cash outflow from the purchase of intangible assets, laboratory and office equipment (26 ) (93 ) Cash outflow for the investment in non-current financial assets 0 (36 ) Net cash flows used in investing activities (26 ) (129 ) Financing activities Proceeds from issuance of preferred shares 1,500 0 Net cash flows from financing activities 1,500 0 Effect of exchange rate changes 0 (2,163 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents (1,252 ) (8,042 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,252 ) (8,042 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 29,117 123,282 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 27,864 115,240 IFX-1 is a first-in-class monoclonal anti-complement factor C5a antibody, which highly and effectively blocks the biological activity of C5a and demonstrates high selectivity towards its target in human blood. Thus, IFX-1 leaves the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) intact as an important defense mechanism, which is not the case for molecules blocking the cleavage of C5. IFX-1 has demonstrated control of the inflammatory response driven tissue and organ damage by specifically blocking C5a as a key “amplifier” of this response in pre-clinical studies. IFX-1 is the first monoclonal anti-C5a antibody introduced into clinical development that has, to date, successfully completed three clinical Phase II studies. In total, more than 150 patients have so far been treated with IFX-1, which was well tolerated. IFX-1 is currently being developed for different inflammatory indications.\nInflaRx N.V. (Nasdaq:IFRX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on applying its proprietary anti-C5a technology to discover and develop first-in-class, potent and specific inhibitors of C5a. Complement C5a is a powerful inflammatory mediator involved in the progression of a wide variety of autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. InflaRx was founded in 2007 and has offices in Jena and in Munich, Germany. For further information please visit www.inflarx.com .\nContacts:\nInflaRx N.V.\nProf. Dr. Niels C.
