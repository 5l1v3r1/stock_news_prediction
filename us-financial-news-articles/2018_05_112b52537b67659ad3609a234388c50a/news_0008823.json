(NASDAQ: STRA) today announced financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018. Financial highlights are as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31:\nFor the first quarter, student enrollment at the Company’s main operating unit, Strayer University, increased 6% to 46,184 compared to 43,387 for the same period in 2017. New student enrollment for the period increased 6% and continuing student enrollment for the period increased 7%. Revenue was $116.5 million compared to $114.9 million for the same period in 2017, as higher winter term enrollment was offset by lower revenue per student due to the continuing effect of scholarships issued in the fall 2017 term. Income from operations decreased to $11.3 million from $18.4 million for the same period in 2017, primarily due to costs associated with the Company’s pending merger with Capella Education Company. Adjusted income from operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, was $16.7 million compared to $18.4 million in the same period in 2017. For more details on non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the information on pages 8 through 10. Net income, which includes the effects of the new lower federal income tax rate, was $9.5 million, and adjusted net income was $13.9 million, compared to net income of $10.6 million in the same period in 2017. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) was $16.4 million compared to $22.8 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.8 million compared to $25.7 million in the same period in 2017. Diluted earnings per share was $0.84 compared to $0.95 for the same period in 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 29% to $1.23 from $0.95 for the same period in 2017. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased 2% to 11,311,000 from 11,121,000 for the same period in 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $165.9 million and no debt. Cash flow from operations was $17.0 million compared to $24.5 million during 2017, primarily due to cash payments of costs related to the Company’s pending merger with Capella Education Company. Capital expenditures for 2018 were $4.2 million compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 5.5% compared to 3.8% for the same period in 2017.\nThe Company had $70.0 million of share repurchase authorization remaining at March 31, 2018. No shares were repurchased in the first quarter of 2018.\nQ2 2018 Outlook\nTotal enrollments at Strayer University for the second quarter of 2018 are anticipated to grow 8% to approximately 46,800 students from 43,411 students for the same period in 2017. New student enrollments are expected to increase approximately 7% and continuing student enrollments are expected to increase approximately 8%. Revenue per student for the second quarter is expected to decrease by approximately 5% due primarily to the continuation of students participating in scholarship programs launched in 2017. Additionally, the Company expects the tax rate in the second quarter to be in the range of 27% to 28%, excluding the impact of any non-deductible merger costs, and other discrete tax adjustments.\nNew Campus Openings\nThe Company opened a new campus in Macon, Georgia, incorporating a new smaller, more cost-efficient design intended to service a student body that values a brick-and-mortar presence, even while taking an increasing majority of their courses online. The Company is on track to open two to three additional new campuses by the end of 2018.\nCommon Stock and Common Stock Equivalents\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had 11,300,671 common shares issued and outstanding, including 458,522 shares of restricted stock. The Company also had 250,000 restricted stock units outstanding and 100,000 vested stock options outstanding.\nCommon Stock Cash Dividend\nThe Company announced today that it declared a regular, quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on June 18, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 4, 2018.\nMerger Update\nThe Company confirmed today that its pending merger with Capella Education Company remains on track to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to approval by the Higher Learning Commission, Capella University’s accreditor.\nConference Call with Management\nStrayer Education, Inc. to discuss its first quarter 2018 earnings results at 10:00 a.m. (ET) today.

We discuss management’s reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we reference. Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others.\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s financial performance because those non-GAAP measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of its ongoing operations before the impact of these items. These measures are Adjusted Income from Operations, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share. These non-GAAP measures exclude charges associated with the Company’s previously announced merger with Capella Education Company. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation expense and costs related to the Company’s acquisition of the New York Code + Design Academy. Each of these non-GAAP measures is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on pages 9 and 10. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, the Company’s reported GAAP results.\nSTRAYER EDUCATION, INC.
