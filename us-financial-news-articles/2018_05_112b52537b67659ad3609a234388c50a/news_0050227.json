(the \"Company\" or \"INWK\") (NASDAQ: INWK). The investigation focuses on possible breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws in connection with the Company's May 7 announcement that it would be postponing the release of its first quarter 2018 financial results due to errors in its historical financial statements. As a result of these errors, the Company stated it will be \"restating its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and all interim periods within those years.\"\nWeissLaw is investigating whether INWK's Board breached its fiduciary duties by, among other things, failing to ensure that an effective system of internal controls was maintained over the Company's financial reporting.
