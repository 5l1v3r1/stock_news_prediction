Bitcoin has recovered roughly 40 percent from the lows around $6,700 last month but has been unable to break the $10,000 level.\nBerkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett piled on his recent bitcoin criticism Monday and told CNBC the \"asset itself is creating nothing.\"\n\"When you're buying nonproductive assets, all you're counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they're even more excited about another next person coming along,\" he said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" from Omaha, following Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting.\nOver the weekend, Buffett had called bitcoin \" probably rat poison squared ,\" while Berkshire Chairman Charlie Munger said during the annual meeting that trading in cryptocurrencies is \"just dementia.\" show chapters 5 Hours Ago | 00:32\nMicrosoft Co-founder Bill Gates told CNBC in the same interview Monday that he would bet against bitcoin if he could.\n\"As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up.
