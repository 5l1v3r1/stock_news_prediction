Conde has not yet commented on his intentions.\nHe did not provide an explanation for the latest government shakeup, but an official at the presidency, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the president “wanted an experienced man capable of making decisions”.\nConde’s government has also faced repeated protests by civil servants and residents of mining towns, who complain that the country’s rich mineral deposits have not translated into improved public services or job opportunities.\nGuinea is Africa’s top producer of bauxite, which is used to make aluminum. It also has significant reserves of iron ore.\nReporting by Saliou Samb; writing by Aaron Ross, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T02:11:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
