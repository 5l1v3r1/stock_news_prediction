It could be that we move towards quotas. Everything is open, but it’s difficult.”\nThe areas identified for discussion are: greater market access for industrial products, including cars, and to government tenders; energy, notably liquefied natural gas (LNG); possible cooperation among regulators; and reform of the World Trade Organization.\nExport-oriented Germany, which has been the keenest to avoid a trade conflict, described the EU leaders’ proposals as a first step and forecast “intensive discussion” on Tuesday to find a deal acceptable to both Europe and the United States.\n“Time is running out,” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said. “We know what is on the menu, now we need to get a good meal together. I think that is feasible.”\nSo far, the United States has given permanent metals tariff exemptions to Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea, but in each case set import quotas.\nMalmstrom said she could not imagine the EU accepting quotas unless they were at levels of exports in recent years.\n“But we are under the impression that somehow they want to limit steel to the U.S., aluminium as well,” she said.
