REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa\nWitnesses said Israeli soldiers used a drone to down flaming kites that protesters flew over the border in a bid to torch bushes and distract snipers.\nA report by the aid charity Save the Children, published on Friday, said that at least 250 Gazan children had been hit with live bullets during the protests, among nearly 700 children injured overall. The analysis was based on data collected by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.

The Israeli military said on Friday its troops were defending the border and “firing in accordance with the rules of engagement”.\nProtesters were “violent, burning tires and hurling rocks,” it said in a statement. Israel’s military “will not allow any harm to the security infrastructure or security fence and will continue standing by its mission to defend and ensure the security of the citizens of Israel and Israeli sovereignty, as necessary.”\nThe Gaza Strip, home to 2 million people, is run by the Islamist group Hamas which has fought three wars against Israel in the past decade. Israel and Egypt maintain an economic blockade of the strip, which has the highest unemployment rate in the world and has become far poorer than the other main Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nOn Thursday in Gaza, Hamas leader Yehya Al-Sinwar described the protests as peaceful, and said: “We hope these incidents will pass without a large number of martyrs and wounded, and the occupation forces must restrain themselves.”\nSamir, a refugee whose grandfather originally came from Jaffa, which now lies 40 miles up the coast in Israel, rolled tyres towards the area close to the fence where he later burned them.\n“My grandfather told me about Jaffa, where he came from, he said it was the bride of the sea, the most beautiful of all. I want to go back to Jaffa,” he said.\n“Killing me will not change anything, Jaffa will remain Jaffa. They need to kill every last one of us to change the facts.” Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi, Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Catherine Evans and Peter Graff", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:59:59.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
