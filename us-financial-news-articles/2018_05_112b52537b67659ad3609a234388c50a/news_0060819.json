In an interview with MSN , Lubetich claims that for the first two months of her position, she was one of only two women working in the engineering department of its San Francisco office.\n“I want people who maybe feel the same way, but don’t feel empowered to speak out about it to know that they are not alone and to know that it is okay to criticize a culture and try to make it better,” said Lubetich.
