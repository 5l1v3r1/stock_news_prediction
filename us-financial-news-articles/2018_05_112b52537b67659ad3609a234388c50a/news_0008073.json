The increase is attributable to a general increase across a range of industry segments, with healthcare increasing from 11% of total revenue in Q1 2017 to 13% in Q1 2018. The US dollar (average rate) decreased from 1.3238 in Q1 2017 to 1.2647 in Q1 2018, resulting in a negative impact on overall revenue in the period as compared to the same quarter in Q1 2017.\nGross Profit / Adjusted Gross Profit / Gross Profit % / Adjusted Gross Profit %\nGross profit increased to $35.4 million in Q1 2018 from $27.0 million in Q1 2017, an increase of 31.2%. Gross profit % increased to 43.9% from 41.5%.\nAdjusted gross profit increased to $37.2 million in Q1 2018 from $27.9 million in Q1 2017, an increase of 33.6%. Adjusted gross profit % improved to 46.1% from 42.9%.\nThe Company benefited from a number of factors this quarter, including the operational leverage derived from investments made over the past few years, product mix and having a steady manufacturing flow throughout the quarter, which optimizes the allocation of DIRTT’s resources (specifically labor).\nSG&A Expenses / Adjusted SG&A Expenses / SG&A % / Adjusted SG&A %\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) % as a percentage of revenue decreased from 43.0% to 37.5% in Q1 2018 compared with Q1 2017. SG&A expenses increased by $2.3 million, or 8.3% in Q1 2018 compared with Q1 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses in Q1 2018 was due to increases in salaries and benefits of $1.3 million, reorganization costs of $2.1 million due to the recent management changes, professional service fees of $0.6 million related to proxy defense costs and rent expenses of $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing-related assets of $0.5 million, travel and marketing expense of $0.1 million and other operating expenses of $1.0 million.\nAdjusted SG&A % decreased from 36.3% to 31.0% in Q1 2018 compared with Q1 2017. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 6.0%, in Q1 2018 compared with Q1 2017. The reason for the increase is the same as discussed above with respect to SG&A, excluding the impact from decreased depreciation and amortization of non-manufacturing-related assets, decreased stock-based compensation expense incurred in the period and reorganization costs.\nThe impact of the weakening US dollar to Canadian dollar average exchange rates during Q1 2018 partially reduced the overall increase in SG&A and Adjusted SG&A expenses across the organization, as certain of these SG&A expenditures are denominated in US dollars.\nAdjusted EBITDA / Adjusted EBITDA %\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $8.7 million, or 217.1%, in Q1 2018 compared with Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA % in Q1 2018 increased significantly from 6.2% in Q1 2017 to 15.7%. The dollar increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross profit of $9.4 million and increase in foreign exchange gain of $0.7 million, offset by higher adjusted SG&A expenses of $1.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018, we had $65.9 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $79.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, we also had access to an undrawn US$18.0 million revolving credit facility.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nAdjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross profit %, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A %, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA % and cash provided by operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital are non-IFRS measures. Non-IFRS measures do not have a standard meaning as prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented and calculated by other companies. DIRTT believes the non-IFRS measures are useful supplemental measures that may assist investors in assessing DIRTT’s business. The non-IFRS measures should not be considered as the sole measure of the Company’s performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of its financial statements. For a reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures as well as the rationale for management’s use of such measures, see the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, available at http://www.sedar.com .\nConference Call Details\nA conference call and webcast for the investment community is scheduled for Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 9 a.m. ET (7 a.m. MT) to discuss the first quarter results in greater detail.
