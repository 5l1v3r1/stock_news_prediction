Downpours caused some street flooding, he said.\n“So we need to really be careful with that rainfall,” Graham said. The storm was moving north at about 14 mph, he added, “so not real fast.” Related Coverage Exxon pulls offshore workers; Shell, Chevron cut output due to Alberto\nAlberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018 which spun up days before the formal start of the 2018 hurricane season, is expected to intensify and bring wind speeds of up to 65 mph to the Gulf Coast when it approaches over the holiday on Monday, the National Weather Service said.\nBy midday on Sunday, the storm was about 240 miles northwest of Key West, Florida, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).\nState officials urged their residents to monitor the storm.\n“I ask everyone to please make final preparations to your family emergency plan, especially those that live in mobile homes and low-lying areas,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement.
