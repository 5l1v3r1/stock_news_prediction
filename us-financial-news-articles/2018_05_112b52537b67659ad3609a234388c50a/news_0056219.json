But what really launched it was this,” said Patrick. “It’s both of them.\n“I’ve had a lot of good fortune here and did still have some this month.\n“It just didn’t come on race day but we had some good moments.” (Reporting by Steve Keating in Indianapolis; Editing by Clare Fallon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T21:53:37.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
