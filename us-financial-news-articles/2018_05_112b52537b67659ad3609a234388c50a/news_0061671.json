But he earned another one and this time produced a superb backhand winner.\nIt was the German who showed the greater composure at the crucial moments and he sensed his chance as Shapovalov served at 4-5 in the fourth, breaking to love to claim victory and move on to a third-round clash with Estonia’s Jurgen Zopp. (Reporting by Martyn Herman Editing by Peter Graff)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:32:29.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
