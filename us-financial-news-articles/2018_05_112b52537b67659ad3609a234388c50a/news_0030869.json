Lack of any supply this week is also expected to boost support for bonds.\nGermany, France and Spain are entering the bond market this week with fresh issuance though proceeds from redemption of maturing debt is expected to comfortably take care of the supplies, according to Thomson Reuters and Mizuho data.\nRisk appetite was broadly firm across the board pushing yields slightly higher with German 10-year yields up 2 basis points on the day at 0.58 percent.\nElsewhere, spreads between two-year U.S. and German debt held below a 29-year high of nearly 312 basis points hit on Friday.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr"], "published": "2018-05-14T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:45:03.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
