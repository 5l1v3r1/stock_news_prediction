But companies may donate to nonprofits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts has been leading the industry-wide investigation.\nIn December, it announced a $210 million settlement with United Therapeutics Corp to resolve claims it used a charity as a conduit to illegally cover Medicare patients’ out-of-pocket costs in order to eliminate price sensitivity and boost sales.
