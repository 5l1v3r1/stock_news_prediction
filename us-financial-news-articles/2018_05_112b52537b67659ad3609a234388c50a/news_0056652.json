He prevented further scoring by getting a popout and two strikeouts.\nGivens also pitched a hitless seventh and Richard Bleier a scoreless eighth, setting the stage for closer Brad Brach, who worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the ninth, striking out Trayce Thompson to end the game and register his seventh save.\nThe Baltimore bullpen pitched four shutout innings, allowing two hits and striking out five.\nCashner allowed two runs and eight hits in his five-plus innings. He walked three and struck out four.\nWhite Sox starter Hector Santiago (0-2) allowed just five hits in six innings, but three were home runs that produced all the Baltimore scoring. He walked two and struck out seven.\nAbreu had two doubles while Davidson and Garcia added two hits apiece for the White Sox, who lost for just the second time in five games to begin an eight-game homestand.\nThe White Sox out-hit the Orioles 10-5 in defeat.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:26:33.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
