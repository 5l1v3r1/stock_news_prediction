The newco will help develop a management system that will enable conventional air traffic to coexist with drones.\n“The management of drones is one of the key initiatives of our 2018-2022 business plan. Recent data and forecasts allow us to believe that it will indeed be a very rapidly growing phenomenon,” ENAV CEO Roberta Neri said in a statement.\nENAV cited a study which forecast more than 7 million drones flying in European skies by 2035.\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo; editing by Agnieszka Flak\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:25:31.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
