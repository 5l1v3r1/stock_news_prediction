There is no cost or obligation to you.\nAccording to the complaint, throughout the Class Period, the Company issued materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Gridsum lacked effective internal control over financial reporting; (ii) consequently, Gridsum’s financial statements were inaccurate and misleading, and did not fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company; and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Gridsum’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nIf you suffered a loss in Gridsum you have until June 25, 2018 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.
