And this will happen not earlier than at the end of next year,” Ilyin added.\nPreviously, Ilyin said that Eurochem was ready to enter the potash market either independently or as part of a trade alliance with other players.\n“Our competitors are very carefully watching how quickly we can bring production from several hundred thousand to several million tonnes. The production trajectory that we show will affect the market’s perception of us as a potash player,” the CFO added.\nReporting by Natalia Shurmina; writing by Polina Devitt; editing by Adrian Croft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
