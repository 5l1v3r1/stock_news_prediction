Then from 1987 to 2015 he served in the state security services, a similar career path to the one taken by Putin, himself a former KGB spy.\nZinichev’s biography did not specify what jobs he held in the security services. However, multiple photographs of Putin at public events dating over several years show Zinichev standing at Putin’s shoulder, or walking down the steps of his official plane a few steps after the Russian leader.\nThe only people allowed in such regular proximity to Putin at public events, apart from senior officials and aides, are his security detail.\nZinichev was briefly appointed acting governor of the Kaliningrad region in 2016, although he only served for a few months before leaving for what the Kremlin called family reasons. Russian media said he had struggled with the publicity demands of the job.

He had previously been the chairman of the board of directors of Russian Agricultural Bank.\nNikolai Patrushev is also from St Petersburg and was a career intelligence officer before becoming head of the FSB, the main successor agency to the Soviet KGB. He is now Secretary of Putin’s Security Council.\nThe two appointments illustrated how officials with intelligence ties have emerged under Putin at the core of a ruling caste, said Moscow-based political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin.\n“They are forming a fairly closed ruling caste with support from the ‘siloviks’,” said Oreshkin, using a word to describe officials who have served in the security services.\nPutin has in the past recruited intelligence officers and state bodyguards for official roles.

Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS\nIn 2016, Putin named Alexei Dyumin, who served in the Federal Guard Service (FSO), responsible for Kremlin security, as the governor overseeing Tula region south of Moscow. TERM LIMITS\nThe Cabinet appointments will be analyzed by Kremlin-watchers for any indications that Putin could be grooming someone as a successor.\nSworn in for a new term this month after he won a March 18 presidential election, Putin, 65, can not under the constitution run again because of term limits. He is now on his second consecutive term, and the fourth in total.\nAnalysts say he may find a way to de facto retain power after his term ends in 2024, or could seek to anoint a successor. Putin, though, has given no indication he wants to do that, or of who that person might be.\nDmitry Medvedev, whom Putin had already reappointed as prime minister, unveiled the new cabinet at a meeting with Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\nMost of the incumbents kept their jobs, among them Foreign Minister Lavrov, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, and Alexander Novak, the energy minister who helped mastermind a global deal to prop up crude oil prices.

His role is under the spotlight because Russia is hosting the soccer World Cup next month.\nThe currency market reacted negatively to the appointments in the minutes after the lineup was unveiled.\nThe rouble pared gains and weakened to 62.19 versus the dollar from levels of 62.08 seen before the announcement.
