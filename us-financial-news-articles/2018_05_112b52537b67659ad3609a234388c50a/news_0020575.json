These assumptions are rarely, if ever, strictly met in nature. Log-normal or other skewed distributions and time-dependent or auto-correlated data are more typical. I think the major reason behind these erroneous assumptions is the ease of data analysis if these assumptions are made.\nSo-called distribution-free, auto-correlational and Bayesian analytical techniques are available, but they often aren’t used because of statistical robustness issues or lack of familiarity on the part of researchers. Researchers often take their cue for statistical decisions from peer-reviewed literature, but this is often a case of the blind leading the blind. Strict attention to the use of appropriate statistical assumptions and analytical techniques would lead to more accurate studies with more reproducible results.\nJoe Visalli\nSchodack, N.Y.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:37:24.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
