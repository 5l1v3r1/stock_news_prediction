What is the purpose of it?” Representative Nancy Pelosi told reporters, saying the briefings could help Republican President Donald Trump. “I don’t even think this information should be conveyed to Congress if it has a possibility of it affecting the president’s defense in this investigation.”\nAfter a push from Democratic and Republican leaders on Wednesday, the Justice Department invited Democrats to one of two briefings scheduled on the FBI investigation into possible Russian election meddling and Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about a “spy” being used against his campaign.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert and Amanda Becker; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T02:38:42.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
