Hungary’s quota is fewer than 1,300 asylum seekers.\nGulyas said the government would submit amended legislation to parliament next Tuesday, including changes to the criminal code, the law regulating police, the law relating to the borders and the law governing asylum rights.\nHe did not reveal further details but said experts of the Venice Commission, a panel of constitutional law experts of the human rights body Council of Europe, were in Hungary, holding talks with the government about the legislation.\nThe “Stop Soros” bill was submitted in its first form to parliament in February. Soros’s pro-democracy foundation said last week that it would shut its office in Budapest and move to Berlin, leaving what it called “an increasingly repressive political and legal environment” in Hungary.\nGulyas also reiterated that the ruling Fidesz party, using its two-thirds majority in parliament, will modify the constitution to ensure that the European Union cannot force the country to accept migrants.\nHe said the government would make it clear that under the Geneva convention Hungary is willing to grant refugee status to those who are entitled to it — if Hungary is the first safe country they enter.\nOn the politically sensitive question of the judiciary, Gulyas reiterated that the government planned to set up a new high court to deal with lawsuits concerning public administration.
