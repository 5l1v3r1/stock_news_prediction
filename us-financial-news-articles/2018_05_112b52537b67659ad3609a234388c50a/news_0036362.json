Shares in the company even rose after his appearance. And several of the U.S. lawmakers often appeared to fail to grasp the technical details of Facebook's operations and data privacy.\nHe might get tougher questions in Brussels, where an assertive new European data protection law comes into effect on May 25. The law will give Facebook's millions of European users more control over what companies can do with what they post, search and click.\nYet the question of whether Zuckerberg should explain himself publicly remains a point of contention.\nThe president of the ALDE liberal group, Guy Verhofstadt already said he would not attend the meeting if it was behind closed doors. \"It must be a public hearing - why not a Facebook Live,\" he asked in a Tweet.\nTajani said that simply showing up to explain himself was already a good move. \"It is a step in the right direction towards restoring confidence,\" he said. \"Our citizens deserve a full and detailed explanation.\"\nOn Monday, Zuckerberg will also attend a meeting organized by French President Emmanuel Macron aimed at pressuring tech giants to use their global influence for public good.\nZuckerberg's EU visit will be his first since a whistleblower alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. Cambridge says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign, and Facebook is investigating.\nDamian Collins, the head of the U.K. parliament's media committee, has said he hopes Zuckerberg would take advantage of his trip to Europe next week to visit London and testify there as well.\nZuckerberg has so far declined to appear, to the British lawmakers' annoyance. Collins warned Zuckerberg last month that if he does not come voluntarily, he could be issued a formal summons, which would force him to appear before the parliament when he next enters the U.K.\nAngela Charlton in Paris, Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:38:03.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
