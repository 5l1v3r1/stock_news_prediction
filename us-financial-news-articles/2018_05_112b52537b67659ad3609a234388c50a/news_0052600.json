The average coupon for convertible debt issued this year is 2.5%, the lowest on record, according to Dealogic. Tech companies are paying just 1.0% on average.\nThree— Nutanix Inc., RingCentral Inc. and Etsy Inc. —have issued convertible bonds this year that pay no interest. Since the dot-com crash, such deals have been relatively rare. Only 13 other companies had issued convertible bonds without coupons since then.\nAnd just this week, FireEye Inc., Square Inc., and Envestnet Inc. issued a total of roughly $1.7 billion in convertible notes. The pace of issuance has accelerated in the past month and is expected to remain robust, bankers and lawyers say.\nConvertible bonds give investors the right to trade the securities for equity once a company’s shares hit a certain price. In a sign of investors’ ravenous appetite for tech-company paper, conversion prices are only slightly below average even with the depressed coupons. Convertible bonds for tech companies this year have had conversion premiums—typically calculated as a percentage above the stock price at the time of issuance—of 31.3%, according to Dealogic. That compares with the historical average of 32%.\nThe demand shows more broadly how hungry investors are for tech-company shares after years of depressed new issuance, which has recently begun to perk up. Tech companies raised $11.2 billion from 22 IPOs, nearly double the proceeds at this time last year. Those that have gone public in the U.S. this year are currently trading about 38% above their IPO prices on average compared with a 20% gain for all U.S.-listed new issues.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 tech index was up 10.5% this year as of Thursday’s close, while the broader S&P 500 has risen 2%.\nThe surge in convertible debt worries some investors who see a bubble developing at a time when there are signs the multiyear bull market in stocks has run its course. But that has yet to damp demand.\nAnd tech companies are even more bullish on their own stocks.\nThey’re betting they will eclipse the level at which the companies have agreed to convert shares during the bonds’ life, which is usually five years. Most of the tech companies that have issued convertible debt this year have paid for a “call-spread overlay,” a derivative that typically increases the price at which shares convert to double the starting price. The cost of these derivatives is steep—between 5% and 10% of proceeds, bankers and issuers estimate—but they reduce the risk of dilution that conversion triggers.\nCompanies are aware that rates are likely to keep going up, so they are looking to “raise cash now and get some optionality at some of the most historically attractive levels for issuers,” said Serkan Savasoglu, head of equity solutions for the Americas at Morgan Stanley.\nZendesk Inc. went public in May 2014, and its stock has risen more than sixfold since then. The software company raised $575 million with a convertible bond in March, with a premium of 32.5% above its closing price before the deal was struck and a coupon of 0.25%.\nJohn Geschke, Zendesk’s chief legal officer, said in an interview he was wary of potentially diluting the company’s shareholders, so he opted to pay nearly 10%, or about $56 million, for a call-spread overlay. Still, he said, the low cost of the bonds made the deal appealing even after the fee.\nWhile Zendesk didn’t have a specific use of proceeds, it made sense to take the cash now for possible acquisitions or other investment opportunities, Mr. Geschke said. Part of the appeal for companies is the expedited time frame for getting access to this capital. Mr. Geschke said the issuance process took about 10 days compared with roughly seven months for Zendesk’s IPO, which raised around $115 million.\nTechnology companies are essentially being “paid to wait” until they can use the capital, said Michael Voris, global head of convertible-bond financing at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nWith companies earning higher rates on their cash, “the burden of paying a low convertible coupon is de minimis,” he said.\nRick Kline, a partner at law firm Goodwin Procter LLP and co-chair of its capital-markets practice, said many of these companies want access to capital so they can compete for acquisitions against the likes of Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and other cash-rich technology companies. “Now this class of companies will be in a better competitive position to go after smaller companies,” he said.\nInvestors, bankers and lawyers have all become so familiar with how these deals work, he said, “It’s been a bit of wash, rinse, repeat.”\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:21:10.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
