It said in January that it is providing automaker Audi with Exynos processor chips.\nSystem LSI still uses Samsung's foundry for all of its manufacturing needs, but is in talks with other contract manufacturers to diversify production in areas Samsung's foundry isn't prepared for yet, such as high-voltage automotive products, Kang said.\nTSMC is the world's top contract chip manufacturer, followed by the likes of U.S.-based Global Foundries, Taiwan-based UMC and Samsung.\nSamsung's semiconductor business, reporting a 2017 operating profit of 35.2 trillion won ($33 billion), contributed more than 65 percent of the whole firm's record annual profit of 53.65 trillion won last year.\nOut of this semiconductor business, memory chips contributed about 96 percent of the profits as it rode a \"boom\" cycle, while System LSI and foundry took up the rest with about 1.44 trillion won in 2017 operating profits, according to data from Mirae Asset Daewoo Securities.\nKang said his business is expected to see a 5-10 percent revenue growth this year in dollar terms. He declined to provide last year's growth rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:11:04.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
