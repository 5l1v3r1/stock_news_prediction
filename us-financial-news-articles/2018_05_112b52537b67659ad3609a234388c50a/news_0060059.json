The magazine said Bayer’s board would look at the review at the start of June.\nThe spokesman for Bayer gave no details on the timeline for the review, given the title ‘Super Bowl’, and did not say how many jobs would be affected. He said Bayer routinely examined its R&D operations.\nBayer employs around 8,000 people worldwide in its pharmaceutical business. In November, it announced that it would combine its R&D operations into a new function.\nSome of the German group’s shareholders have voiced concern that Bayer risks neglecting its drugs business following its planed $63.5 billion takeover of U.S. seeds group Monsanto , which won U.S. approval on Tuesday.\nBayer’s pharmaceuticals business faces a threat to revenues when in 2024 when the blockbuster heart drug Xarelto loses its patent.
