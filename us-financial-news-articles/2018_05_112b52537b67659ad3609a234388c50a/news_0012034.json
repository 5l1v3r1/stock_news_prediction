The Fed unanimously decided to keep its lending rate in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent. It is expected to increase rates in June.\nThe Fed’s announcement assuaged investors’ concerns about the possibility of accelerated interest-rate increases as rising materials costs for companies have signaled a pickup in inflation.\n“I’d call what the market is doing a sigh of relief because we didn’t get an unexpected hike,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.48 points, or 0.16 percent, to 24,137.53, the S&P 500 gained 1.63 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,656.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.18 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,159.88.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 40 new lows.
