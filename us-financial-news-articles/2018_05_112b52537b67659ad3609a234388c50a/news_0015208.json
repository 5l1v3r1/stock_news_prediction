REUTERS/Nir Keidar Sam Bennett of Bora-Hansgrohe was in the lead with a kilometer of the 229km stage left but Viviani showcased his impressive power to close in on the Irishman before the final corner and he crossed the finish line first.\nBritain’s Chris Froome advanced to 19th place in the overall standings but remained 38 seconds off the pace. He finished in the leading bunch of 93 riders to cross the line in five hours, two minutes and nine seconds.\nViviani, who won the second stage after a similar comeback on Saturday, finished ahead of Sacha Modolo (Cannondale-Drapac). Bennett had to settle for third.\nViviani, who took omnium gold in the 2016 Rio Olympics, said his stage wins proved that his hard work was paying off.\n“I have always raced without thinking about my competitors, I just focus on myself and my training,” he said.\n“To be at the top level and you have to win stages in grand tours and classics, I was looking for this maturity at the Giro and I think I have demonstrated that I am at the top.”\nCycling - the 101st Giro d'Italia cycling race - The 229-km Stage 3 from Beersheba to Eilat, Israel - May 6, 2018 - Team Quick-Step rider Elia Viviani of Italy celebrates winning the 3rd stage in Eilat, Israel.
