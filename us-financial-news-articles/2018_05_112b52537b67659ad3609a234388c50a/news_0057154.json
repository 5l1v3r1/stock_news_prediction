The statement on Tuesday gave no indication of the deal value.\nThe acquisition comes at a time when software companies are reorienting themselves to focus on higher-margin businesses such as cloud-computing, cyber-security and data analytics to counter a slowdown in their legacy businesses.\nThe S&P 500 software index of 16 large U.S. software vendors has climbed some 75 percent over the past two years. In 2018 alone, it has gained 15.8 percent, eclipsing the benchmark S&P 500's 1.8 percent advance.\nKKR has invested about $26 billion in the technology sector over the past decade, and BMC will join a portfolio that includes Mitchell, Epicor and Calabrio - all firms that make software used by businesses.\nThe deal comes after BMC explored both an initial public offering that would have valued the company at more than $10 billion as well as a merger with fellow software maker CA, Reuters has reported.\nThe merger talks fell through in July last year after BMC struggled to arrange financing for the deal, sources told Reuters.\nKKR's acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.\nCredit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, Macquarie and Mizuho Bank provided financing for the acquisition.\nGoldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley were BMC's financial advisers, while Macquarie Capital advised KKR.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T14:50:57.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
