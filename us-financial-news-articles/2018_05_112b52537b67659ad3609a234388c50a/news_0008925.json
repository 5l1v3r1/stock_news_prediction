Meanwhile both Malaysia and South Korea saw factory activity shrink, while across most readings, export orders show weakness.\nData from emerging Europe showed a better picture, with both Polish and Czech PMIs recording accelerating growth.\nYet data from Turkey showed the manufacturing sector shrinking following 13 months of growth.\nThis followed hot on the heels of data showing Turkey’s trade deficit increased nearly a third year-on-year in April and a cut of Ankara’s sovereign rating into deeper “junk” territory in a surprise move by S&P Global Ratings, ting widening concern about the outlook for inflation amid a recent lira sell-off. The confluence of data made the lira gave up early gains, to trade flat against the dollar.\nMeanwhile currencies elsewhere bounced following two days of hefty losses. South Africa’s rand and Russia’s rouble strengthened 0.5 percent while Mexico’s peso gained 0.3 percent.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see\nReporting by Karin Strohecker Additional reporting by Marc Jones Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-02T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T12:23:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
