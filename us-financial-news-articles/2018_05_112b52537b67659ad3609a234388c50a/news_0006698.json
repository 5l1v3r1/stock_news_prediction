(“HEP” or the “Partnership”) (NYSE:HEP) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Net income attributable to HEP for the first quarter was $46.2 million ($0.44 per basic and diluted limited partner unit) compared to $25.6 million ($0.13 per basic and diluted limited partner unit) for the first quarter of 2017.\nDistributable cash flow was $69.1 million for the quarter, up $11.8 million, or 20.6% compared to the first quarter of 2017. HEP announced its 54th consecutive distribution increase on April 19, 2018, raising the quarterly distribution from $0.650 to $0.655 per unit, which represents an increase of 5.6% over the distribution for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in earnings is primarily due to higher pipeline throughputs and revenues as well as increased earnings related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the SLC and Frontier pipelines in the fourth quarter 2017, which were partially offset by higher interest expense. In addition, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCommenting on our 2018 first quarter results, George Damiris, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “The acquisition of the SLC and Frontier pipelines along with solid volume growth in the Southwest allowed us to maintain a distribution coverage ratio greater than 1.0x for the quarter.\n“Looking forward, we expect to see a typical slight seasonal downturn in the second quarter followed by a strong rebound in the second half of 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Revenue Highlights\nRevenues for the quarter were $128.9 million, an increase of $23.3 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the SLC and Frontier pipelines and the turnaround at HollyFrontier Corporation's (\"HFC\" or \"HollyFrontier\") Navajo refinery in the first quarter of 2017. These two changes led to an increase in overall pipeline volumes of 47%.\nRevenues from our refined product pipelines were $34.9 million, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, and shipments averaged 217.0 mbpd compared to 192.4 mbpd for the first quarter of 2017. Revenues and volumes both increased primarily due to the turnaround at HFC's Navajo refinery in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues from our intermediate pipelines were $8.5 million, an increase of $3.2 million, on shipments averaging 127.0 mbpd compared to 104.3 mbpd for the first quarter of 2017. These increases were principally due to the turnaround at HFC's Navajo refinery in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues from our crude pipelines were $28.8 million, an increase of $11.9 million, on shipments averaging 486.4 mbpd compared to 268.9 mbpd for the first quarter of 2017. The increases are mainly attributable to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the SLC and Frontier pipelines in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as increased volumes on our crude pipeline systems in New Mexico and Texas. Revenues from terminal, tankage and loading rack fees were $38.2 million, an increase of $4.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. Refined products and crude oil terminalled in the facilities averaged 452.8 mbpd compared to 444.6 mbpd for the first quarter of 2017. These increases are primarily due to higher volumes in several of our terminals as well as an adjustment in revenue recognition. Revenues from refinery processing units were $18.5 million, a decrease of $0.8 million on throughputs averaging 66.9 mbpd compared to 62.8 mbpd for the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenue is principally due to lower throughputs at the Woods Cross refinery due to maintenance.\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, include the recognition of $2.2 million of prior shortfalls billed to shippers in 2017. As of March 31, 2018, deferred revenue reflected in our consolidated balance sheet related to shortfalls billed was $2.5 million.\nOperating Costs and Expenses Highlights\nOperating costs and expenses were $64.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing an increase of $10.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to new operating costs and expenses related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the SLC and Frontier pipelines in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense was $17.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing an increase of $4.0 million over the same period of 2017. The increase is primarily due to interest expense associated with the private placement of an additional $100 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6% Senior Notes due in 2024 completed in the third quarter of 2017, higher average balances outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2018, and market interest rate increases under that facility.\nWe have scheduled a webcast conference call today at 4:00 PM Eastern Time to discuss financial results.

HEP net income allocated to the general partner included incentive distributions that were declared subsequent to quarter end. There were no distributions made on the general partner interest after October 31, 2017 and general partner distributions were $17.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. (2) Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is calculated as net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners plus (i) interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of interest income, (ii) state income tax and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus loss on early extinguishment of debt. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculations based upon generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). However, the amounts included in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners or operating income, as indications of our operating performance or as alternatives to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented here because they are widely used financial indicators used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for compliance with financial covenants.\nSet forth below is our calculation of EBITDA. Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners $ 46,168 $ 25,563 Add (subtract): Interest expense 16,824 12,769 Interest Income (515 ) (102 ) Amortization of discount and deferred debt charges 757 770 State income tax expense 82 106 Depreciation and amortization 25,142 18,777 EBITDA $ 88,458 $ 57,883 Add loss on early extinguishment of debt — 12,225 Adjusted EBITDA $ 88,458 $ 70,108 (3) Distributable cash flow is not a calculation based upon GAAP. However, the amounts included in the calculation are derived from amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements, with the general exception of maintenance capital expenditures. Distributable cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners or operating income, as an indication of our operating performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Distributable cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Distributable cash flow is presented here because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare partnership performance. It is also used by management for internal analysis and our performance units. We believe that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets and the cash our business is generating. Set forth below is our calculation of distributable cash flow. Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners $ 46,168 $ 25,563 Add (subtract): Depreciation and amortization 25,142 18,777 Amortization of discount and deferred debt charges 757 770 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 12,225 Customer billings greater / (less) than revenue recognized (1,681 ) 1,178 Maintenance capital expenditures (4) (318 ) (825 ) Decrease in environmental liability (140 ) (246 ) Decrease in reimbursable deferred revenue (1,177 ) (925 ) Other non-cash adjustments 348 772 Distributable cash flow $ 69,099 $ 57,289 (4) Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives. Maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tankage and pipeline integrity, safety and to address environmental regulations. March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,565 $ 7,776 Working capital $ 15,470 $ 18,906 Total assets $ 2,134,789 $ 2,154,114 Long-term debt $ 1,390,952 $ 1,507,308 Partners' equity (5) $ 493,404 $ 393,959 (5) As a master limited partnership, we distribute our available cash, which historically has exceeded our net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners because depreciation and amortization expense represents a non-cash charge against income. The result is a decline in partners’ equity since our regular quarterly distributions have exceeded our quarterly net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners. Additionally, if the assets contributed and acquired from HollyFrontier while we were a consolidated variable interest entity of HollyFrontier had been acquired from third parties, our acquisition cost in excess of HollyFrontier’s basis in the transferred assets would have been recorded in our financial statements as increases to our properties and equipment and intangible assets at the time of acquisition instead of decreases to partners’ equity.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005478/en/\nHolly Energy Partners, L.P.\nRichard L.
