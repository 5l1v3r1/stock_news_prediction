Late on Wednesday, Berlusconi accepted a demand from 5-Star that his Forza Italia party take no part in the next government.\n“With Berlusconi out, an anti-establishment government is one step closer to reality and while both these parties may have their differences, they are united in at least one thing: more fiscal stimulus,” said Antoine Bouvet, a rates strategist at Mizuho in London.\nYields also rose at the short end of the Italian curve, with two-year bond yields rising 3 basis points to a two-month high at minus 0.13 percent.\nThe spread between two-year and 10-year bonds widened to a six-week high of 206 basis points.\nThough a government led by 5-Star might not be the market’s ideal outcome, Morgan Stanley strategists said spreads should move higher only if there was a sharp pick-up in bond issuance to fund any fiscal stimulus plan.\nSome investors, such as Charles Diebel, head of rates at Aviva Investors, said once enough yield premium is built in, Italian debt will remain a buy but it does not bode well for the European Union project.\nROBUST DEMAND Apart from Italy, robust demand continued for peripheral debt. Data on Thursday showed Japanese investors bought a record 282.1 billion yen ($2.57 billion) of Spanish bonds in March as slim pickings in core European bonds and higher hedging costs for U.S. Treasury debt fuelled demand.\nWith the exception of Italy, most bond yields in the bloc fell on Thursday, dragged down by U.S. and British peers. Some European markets were closed for holidays.\nIn Britain, gilt yields fell after the Bank of England held interest rates steady and cut its growth and inflation forecasts.\nU.S. Treasury yields also fell as a smaller-than-expected increase in the April consumer price index reduced fears that domestic inflation is picking up steam as the labor market tightens.
