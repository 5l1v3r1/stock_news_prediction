In the end, we are happy with the terms of his temporary release.\n“We are extremely disappointed that the RFU chose to take this unusual step in seeking this release given that Brad has not yet played rugby in England.”\nA typically combative and mobile New Zealand loose forward, Shields won the 2016 Super Rugby title with the Hurricanes and helped them to a draw with the British and Irish Lions last year.\n“I’m really appreciative that New Zealand Rugby has considered my request,” the Hurricanes captain said.\n“I know it’s been a complex matter for them but I’m hugely grateful for their support on this.”\nHis potential selection for England while still playing in New Zealand has not been universally welcomed with World Cup winning coach Clive Woodward among those criticising the move.\nWoodward said in his Daily Mail column this week that fast-tracking Shields into the squad was “intrinsically wrong” and a “slap in the face” for other English players who are unable to play for their country while contracted to foreign clubs.\nEddie Jones will name his squad for the three-test tour of South Africa later on Thursday.
