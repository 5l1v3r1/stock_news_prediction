(TSX:DPM) (“DPM” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has further strengthened its stakeholder partnerships in Namibia through a transaction to address the empowerment initiatives being developed to aid previously disadvantaged Namibians.\nDPM has entered into an agreement with Greyhorse Mining (Pty) Ltd. (“GHM”) pursuant to which GHM will acquire an indirect 8% interest in Dundee Precious Metals Tsumeb (Pty) Ltd. (“DPMT”), the owner and operator of DPM’s Tsumeb smelter operation in Namibia (the “GHM Transaction”). An additional indirect 2% interest in DPMT is also expected to be acquired by an employee trust benefiting DPMT’s employees (the “Employee Trust Transaction”).\nOver the last several years, the Namibian government has been developing a national policy framework referred to as the New Equitable Economic Empowerment Framework (the “NEEE Framework”) that seeks to address economic inequalities within Namibian society with particular focus on six pillars, including: ownership, management, control and employment equity, human resources and skills development, entrepreneurship development and marketing, corporate social responsibility and value addition, technology and innovation. The Namibian government has recently tabled a draft bill, based on the NEEE Framework, which is currently in the consultation phase. Maintaining a strong license to operate is fundamental to DPM’s strategy and requires alignment with the relevant local and national objectives in a given area which guided the structure and governance for the GHM and Employee Trust Transactions.\nDPM’s goal in structuring the GHM Transaction is to establish an empowerment partnership that is both economically sustainable and as broad-based as possible. The GHM Transaction is structured with the intent of ensuring that groups and individuals receive, directly or indirectly, economic benefits from an ownership interest in DPMT through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation. Through an experienced leadership team and its own network of stakeholders and partners, GHM intends to execute a broad-based empowerment strategy based on enterprise and entrepreneurial development, skills development, mentorship and knowledge transfer.\n“Since purchasing the Tsumeb smelter in 2010, we have made significant investments both in the operation to modernize its facilities and in the local community. These initiatives have transformed the smelter, empowered local Namibians and strengthened our relationships with all stakeholders,” stated Rick Howes, President and CEO of DPM. “As a leader in corporate responsibility, and as another demonstration of our support to the government of Namibia and its NEEE Framework, we believe this transaction will help to achieve the objectives of economic empowerment across a broad group of Namibians, including our own employees.”\n“We are extremely excited about our new partnership with DPM and DPMT,” said Saul Kahuika President of GHM. “This transaction is another example of how DPM has delivered on its commitments to stakeholders in Namibia and has proactively addressed the NEEE Framework.”\nThe principal terms and conditions of the GHM Transaction are as follows:\nGHM will acquire the 8% equity interest for approximately US$20 million, which approximates DPM’s carrying value; The acquisition will be financed by DPM vendor financing provided by an indirect subsidiary of DPM; The vendor financing will be made through the issuance to the DPM subsidiary by a subsidiary of GHM of 8% cumulative preferred shares that have a face value equal to the acquisition price; The GHM Transaction provides for GHM to receive a preferential annual dividend of $500,000 for the first 5 years, subject to DPMT having sufficient available distributable funds and GHM achieving approved performance metrics; Available distributable cash in excess of the preferential dividend received by GHM and its 8% cumulative dividend obligation will be used to redeem the preferred shares. In the event of a default or non-compliance with the terms of the financing or shareholders’ agreement, DPM has the right to take back the 8% indirect equity interest; GHM shall be entitled to nominate one of DPMT’s five board members that will include three directors that are DPM employees and a fifth independent director to provide additional Namibian perspective and diversity.\nThe GHM transaction is subject to execution of definitive documentation which has been substantially agreed between the parties and closing is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter. The structure and documentation associated with the Employee Trust Transaction is currently underway.\nAbout Dundee Precious Metals\nDundee Precious Metals Inc. is a Canadian based, international gold mining company engaged in the acquisition of mineral properties, exploration, development, mining and processing of precious metals.
