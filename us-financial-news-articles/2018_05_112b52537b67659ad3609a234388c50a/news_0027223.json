It takes wage hikes to generate personal consumption,” she said.\nNoda is so far the only contender to say publicly she wants to run in a party leadership vote in September, in which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe aims to gain a third three-year term to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.\nBut Abe’s popularity ratings have skidded in recent months on suspicions of a cover-up linked to cronyism.\nAfter nearly three years of heavy asset purchases failed to drive up inflation to its ambitious 2 percent target, the BOJ revamped its policy framework in 2016 to one better suited to a long-term battle to beat deflation.\nIt now guides short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and long-term rates around zero percent.\nNoda said it was clear the BOJ’s ultra-easy policy was hurting financial institutions’ profits, particularly those in regional areas of Japan.\n“We shouldn’t continue with unprecedented monetary easing for too long,” she said.\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda insists the central bank will maintain its massive stimulus until his price goal is achieved, though critics warn of the diminishing returns and rising costs of prolonged easing such as the hit to bank profits from years of near-zero rates.
