It was a politically risky move for President Mauricio Macri because many Argentines blame the IMF for a 2001 crisis that left millions in poverty.\nMacri’s government is trying to lower its fiscal deficit and control double-digit inflation. The IMF “fully endorses” Argentina’s economic goals, Lagarde said in a statement.\nShe said Argentina had faced volatility as global financial conditions have tightened and as a drought hurt soy and corn export crops.\nMacri was elected in late 2015 pledging to bring Argentina back into the global financial system following more than a decade of leftist populism. The need to build and maintain social consensus for the reforms carried “certain vulnerabilities,” Lagarde said in the statement.\nThe peso closed down 0.37 percent to 24.43 per U.S. dollar on Friday. It weakened 4.42 percent this week and is down more than 15 percent from the beginning of the month.\n“To me (Lagarde’s statement) says they are doing everything they can to minimize the political risk to Macri for doing this and to help as much as possible to allow him to continue with a somewhat accelerated, gradual approach” said Alberto Bernal, chief strategist at XP investments in Miami.
