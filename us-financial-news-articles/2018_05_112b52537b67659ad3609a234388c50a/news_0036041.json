This announcement follows the Company’s formal name change to better reflect its core business. There is no action required by current shareholders in connection with these changes.\n“We are pleased to begin trading under the new symbol “VMHG.”\nThe Marine Industry is experiencing its best years ever, mainly due to the shortage of used vessels and the high demand to replace these vessels domestically and throughout the Caribbean,” Orlando Hernandez C.E.O further stated.\nBoat Owners Association of The United States (BoatUS), the nation’s largest advocacy, services and safety group for recreational boaters, estimates that more than 63,000 recreational boats were damaged or destroyed as a result of both Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, with a combined dollar damage estimate of $655 million (boats only). These numbers are strikingly close to 2012’s Hurricane Sandy, which remains the single-largest industry loss with more than 65,000 boats damaged and more than $650 million in estimated losses.\nBreaking down the 2017 season storms, Hurricane Irma damaged or destroyed 50,000 vessels with approximately $500 million in recreational boat damage. About 13,500 boats were damaged or lost costing $155 million in boat damage as the result of Hurricane Harvey.\nOur business model is to capitalize on the high demand today by building a fully integrated vertical Marine organization with its focus on Sales, Service and Accessories, all surrounded around pleasure boats.\nWith over 20 years of experience you can count on Victory Yacht Sales to be there on a sunny as well as on a rainy day making your nautical experience a fun filled adventure.\nContact:\nwww.VictoryYachts.com\nEmail: corporate@victoryyachts.com\nAbout The Company\nVictory Yacht Sales Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory Marine Holdings Corp., is a world class yacht sales, brokerage and consulting firm with over 25 years of experience in the boating industry, we are located in sunny Miami Florida, the yacht capital of the world.\nwww.Victory Yacht Sales.com has an online inventory of more than two thousand (2000) pre-owned boats and yachts from 28 to 70 feet plus a Worldwide MLS from www.YachtWorld.com with access to more than One Hundred Thousand (100,000) boats, yachts and ships to a thousand feet in length.\nOur philosophy is simple.
