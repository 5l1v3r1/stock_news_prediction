Work was continuing to establish whether Advanced Micro Devices chips were vulnerable.\nBSI did not name any manufacturers involved.\nIntel has declined to comment on the vvulnerabilities described in c’t magazine, while AMD has said it was aware of the media reports and was examining the issue.\nNo comment was immediately available from ARM.
