Last week, the government said several truckers’ unions had agreed to suspend the strike, but one of the biggest groups representing drivers, the Brazilian Association of Truckers (Abcam), rejected the deal.\nBrazilian truck drivers began the stoppage on May 21, asking the government to cut taxes on diesel fuel after a recent spike in prices.\nThe government brought in the military to help clear the roads on Friday, but many truckers remained off the job, threatening an already weak economy.\nOver the weekend, local media reported that armed forces were escorting fuel trucks to supply some essential services. But several Brazilian airports are without fuel and supermarkets are reporting shortage of some fresh products, while farmers say millions of animals may die in the coming days due to lack of feed.\nWrite to Luciana Magalhães at Luciana.Magalhaes@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T05:41:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
