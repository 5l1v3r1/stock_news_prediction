She declined to comment on unconfirmed reports that China was the foreign power in question.\nBoth were placed under formal investigation on Dec. 22 to face charges of spying for a foreign power, compromising classified secrets and delivering information detrimental to fundamental national interests, a judicial source told Reuters.\nOne of the former agents, who have not been identified, also faces charges of directly inciting treason, the source said.\nFrench authorities have not said how recently the alleged double agents are thought to have been operating.\nThe DGSE itself contacted French prosecutors after uncovering the “extremely serious” behavior of its agents, the defense ministry said in a statement late on Thursday.\n“The fact that we sounded the alert is proof of our vigilance,” Parly said.
