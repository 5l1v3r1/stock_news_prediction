The company has not yet determined the cost of the losses.\nAranda said that Grupo Mexico has suffered six “acts of sabotage” near the Gulf coast in recent weeks, causing almost 300,000 tons of merchandise to be stuck at Veracruz’s port.\nReporting by Noe Torres; Writing by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T07:36:36.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
