The opposite is a fixed mindset, which is a \"deep down\" belief that people are unchangeable. show chapters 8:56 AM ET Tue, 27 March 2018 | 02:10\n\"Your mindset can set in motion a whole chain of thoughts and behaviors,\" Schmidt and Rosenberg write. People with a fixed mentality maintain set performance goals and worry about making mistakes that will impact their self image.\nBut with a growth mentality, you'll push yourself to keep learning and taking risks without worrying about how you look, if you're asking a dumb question or whether you're giving the wrong answer. \"And in the long run, you'll learn more and scale greater heights,\" the authors write.\nThis eagerness to learn is particularly important because the world is changing so fast across all industries. In fact, they write, it's almost a given that the role you were hired for will change. For these reasons, it's better to be a \"smart generalist\" than a specialist, especially in the tech industry.\nAccording to Schmidt and Rosenberg, specialists bring an inherent bias to their work because they are laser-focused on what they know. As a result, they may feel threatened by solutions that require additional learning or new expertise.\nSmart generalists, on the other hand, don't have this bias, and so they're able to learn and explore a wide range of solutions before they \"gravitate to the best one.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:34:21.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
