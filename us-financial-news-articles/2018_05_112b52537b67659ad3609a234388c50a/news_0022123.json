The financial impact on the adoption of IFRS 15 is described and attached at the end of the press release.\nNet revenue was RMB 4.3 billion (US$ 689.7 million) compared with RMB 4.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017; Gross profit was RMB 853.5 million (US$ 135.7 million), with an increase in gross margin to 19.7%, compared with RMB 856.0 million and a gross margin of 18.8% in the first quarter of 2017; Operating profit was RMB 424.2 million (US$ 67.5 million) compared with RMB 430.2 million in the first quarter of 2017; Net earnings attributable to China Yuchai's shareholders was RMB 242.8 million (US$ 38.6 million) compared with RMB 248.5 million in the first quarter of 2017; Basic and Diluted earnings per share were RMB 5.94 (US$ 0.95) and RMB 5.93 (US$ 0.94) respectively compared with RMB 6.10 in the first quarter of 2017; The total number of engines sold was 110,113 units compared with 120,010 units in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet revenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 4.7% to RMB 4.3 billion (US$ 689.7 million) compared with RMB 4.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was mainly due to a decline in the number of units sold which was mitigated by a higher average selling price from a better product mix.\nThe total number of engines sold by GYMCL in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 8.2% to 110,113 units compared with 120,010 units in the same quarter last year. Lower unit sales primarily reflected reduced sales of agricultural engines during the first quarter of 2018. According to data reported by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, in the first quarter of 2018, sales of commercial vehicles (excluding gasoline-powered and electric-powered vehicles) increased by 3.6%. The market was led by a 13.8% increase in heavy-duty truck sales. The bus market increased by 4.1% led by 8.7% increase in light-duty buses but was partially offset by lower heavy- and medium-duty bus sales.\nGross profit was RMB 853.5 million (US$ 135.7 million) compared with RMB 856.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin rose to 19.7% from 18.8% in the first quarter of 2017. The gross profit margin increase was mainly attributable to a better product mix.\nOther operating income increased by 27.5% to RMB 50.5 million (US$ 8.0 million) from RMB 39.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income from bank deposits.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses decreased by 3.8% to RMB 119.9 million (US$ 19.1 million) compared with RMB 124.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D spending was 2.8% for the first quarter of 2018 and 2.7% for the same quarter last year. The lower R&D expenses were due to lower consultancy fees in the first quarter of 2018. R&D expenses continued to reflect the further development and testing costs of new engines to meet higher emission standards and ongoing efforts to improve engine quality.\nSelling, general & administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased by 5.6% to RMB 359.9 million (US$ 57.2 million) compared with RMB 340.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. SG&A expenses represented 8.3% of net revenue compared with 7.5% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily related to higher personnel costs.\nOperating profit was RMB 424.2 million (US$ 67.5 million) compared with RMB 430.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating margin increased to 9.8% from 9.4% in the same quarter last year. The margin increase was primarily due to higher gross profit margin during the first quarter of 2018.\nFinance costs decreased by 15.9% to RMB 22.5 million (US$ 3.6 million) compared with RMB 26.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Lower finance costs mainly resulted from lower bills discounting during the first quarter of 2018.\nNet earnings attributable to China Yuchai's shareholders was RMB 242.8 million (US$ 38.6 million) compared with RMB 248.5 million in the same quarter last year.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were RMB 5.94 (US$ 0.95) and RMB 5.93 (US$0.94) respectively, compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of RMB 6.10 in the same quarter last year.\nBasic earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 was based on a weighted average of 40,858,290 shares, and diluted earnings per share was based on a weighted average of 40,916,810 shares compared with 40,712,100 basic and diluted shares in the same quarter last year.\nBalance Sheet Highlights as at March 31, 2018\nCash and bank balances were RMB 4.8 billion (US$ 770.2 million) compared with RMB 6.0 billion at the end of 2017; Trade and bills receivables were RMB 8.9 billion (US$ 1.4 billion) compared with RMB 7.0 billion at the end of 2017; Inventories were RMB 2.5 billion (US$ 405.4 million) compared with RMB 2.6 billion at the end of 2017; Trade and bills payables were RMB 5.4 billion (US$ 865.1 million) compared with RMB 5.2 billion at the end of 2017; Short- and long-term bank borrowings remained unchanged at RMB 1.6 billion (US$ 258.1 million).\nMr. Weng Ming Hoh, President of China Yuchai, commented, \"With our broad portfolio of engines for on- and off-road market sales, our strategy of supplying engines to multiple markets is providing growth in some areas even as other markets are stagnant.

IFRS 15 establishes a five step model to account for revenue arising from the contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.\nThe Group has applied the changes in accounting policies retrospectively to each reporting period presented, using the full retrospective approach. Accordingly, the comparative figures in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2017 and the income statement for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 have been restated to reflect the retrospective adjustments upon adoption of IFRS 15.\nWarranty obligations\nUnder IFRS 15, the Group accounts for a service-type warranty as a separate performance obligation to which the Group allocates a portion of the transaction price. The portion of the consideration allocated to the service-type warranty is initially recorded as a contract liability and recognized as revenue over the period which the warranty services are provided.\nAs a result, the Group's income statement for the first quarter of 2017 was restated as follows:\nRevenue decreased by RMB 6,882,000 to RMB 4,552,639,000. Cost of sales increased by RMB 57,793,000 to RMB 3,696,657,000. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by RMB 64,049,000 to RMB 340,812,000.\nIn summary, the resultant effect of the restatements on the Group's income statement for first quarter of 2017 and the Group's balance sheet as at December 31, 2017 was as follows:\nRevenue was adjusted from RMB 4,559,521,000 to RMB 4,552,639,000. Profit after tax was adjusted from RMB 333,102,000 to RMB 332,476,000. Profit attributable to the owners of the equity holders of the parent was adjusted from RMB 248,981,000 to RMB 248,503,000. Basic and Diluted earnings per share was adjusted from RMB 6.12 to RMB 6.10. Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent was adjusted from RMB 8,347,562,000 to RMB 8,335,433,000.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-yuchai-international-announces-unaudited-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300646120.html\nSOURCE China Yuchai International Limited", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-yuchai-international-announces-unaudited-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300646120.html", "http://www.cyilimited.com/"], "published": "2018-05-10T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:19:15.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
