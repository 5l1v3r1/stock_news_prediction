That service is expected to feature Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans that have been modified to incorporate Waymo's autonomous vehicle technology. It is still unclear where in the country Waymo will launch that program. Waymo is currently testing its autonomous drive technology in 600 Modified Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans, most in California and Arizona .\nFiat Chrysler and Marchionne have been criticized for not investing more money and effort into developing self-driving vehicles. Marchionne has defended his strategy by pointing out automakers are investing billions of dollars in technology that may eventually be commoditized and offered by a number of tech and mobility service companies.\nMeanwhile, Waymo's willingness to discuss licensing its technology is the first indication the company is willing to expand how it works with automakers.\nSome companies, like General Motors are developing their own autonomous vehicle software and technology, while other automakers like Jaguar may opt to partner with mobility technology firms such as Waymo. Earlier this year, Jaguar and Waymo announced a partnership to test autonomous drive vehicles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T19:04:27.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
