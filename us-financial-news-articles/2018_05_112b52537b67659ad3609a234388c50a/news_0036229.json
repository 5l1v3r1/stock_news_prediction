The central bank said “domestic factors” also weakened the currency.\nPolicymakers said the peso could be further hurt by “uncertainty” about Mexico’s presidential election on July 1, as well the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nPolicymakers suggested they could act to defend the peso, if needed. “In the event of a scenario in which the real exchange rate would need to adjust, Banco de Mexico will make sure it is done in an orderly manner,” the bank said.
