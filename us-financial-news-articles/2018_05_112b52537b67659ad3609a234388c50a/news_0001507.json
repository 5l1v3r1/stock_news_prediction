For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we generated free cash flow of $50.0 million, $10.6 million in excess of the $39.4 million we used for debt repayments. Finally, we secured a waiver on our financial covenants for the third quarter and we are continuing to work collaboratively with our lenders on developing long-term solutions to strengthen our balance sheet,” said William C. Kennally, III, Chief Executive Officer of ACETO.\n“Our third quarter results reflect continued adverse conditions in the generics market partially offset by highly effective portfolio management in our Performance Chemicals segment and a rebound in sales in our Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment. In addition, while we have been proactively addressing supply chain challenges in the generics business for the past few quarters, we received notification of failure to supply penalties during the quarter totaling $10.1 million. We expect that by the end of the fiscal year we will have made significant progress toward resolving these previously identified supply chain challenges,” added Mr. Kennally.\n“Although we are facing a prolonged generics industry down cycle, we remain intensely focused on executing our game plans in all of the company’s businesses,” concluded Mr. Kennally. “At Rising, we have launched 15 products since the beginning of fiscal 2018, with plans to meet our previously announced goal of launching 15 to 20 products this fiscal year, and we expect to spend approximately $9 million in R&D for fiscal 2018. Our operational initiatives are also proceeding on schedule: we expect to finish phasing in a new ERP system during the fourth quarter and our new warehouse facility to be fully functional before the end of the calendar year, at which point we will begin to realize $4 million in annualized savings resulting from the new facility. At the same time, we are continuing to pursue our longer-term goal of balancing our asset-light model with more ownership and enhancing the company’s profitability.”\nThird Quarter Financial Review\nIncome Statement\nConsolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $186.0 million, a decrease of 2.2% from $190.1 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Total company gross profit was $27.7 million, a decrease of 34.6%, compared to $42.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the third quarter was 14.9%, compared to 22.3% in the prior year period.\nHuman Health segment sales were $91.9 million, a decrease of 7.9%, compared to $99.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decline was largely due to lower sales at Rising resulting from continued pricing and competitive pressures and softer than expected contributions from new product launches. In addition, Rising incurred approximately $10.1 million in failure to supply charges associated with products acquired from Citron and Lucid. Gross profit for the Human Health segment was $9.5 million, a decrease of 62.3%, compared to $25.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the third quarter was 10.4%, compared to 25.3% in the prior year period. The decreases in gross profit and gross margin were due to an unfavorable product mix in certain Rising products, continued pricing pressure, intense competition and related consolidation of customers and failure to supply charges.\nPharmaceutical Ingredients segment sales were $43.2 million, a decrease of 1.4%, compared to $43.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The segment’s sales decrease reflects lower sales of intermediates, partially offset by higher sales of APIs. Gross profit in the quarter was $7.0 million, a 3.0% decrease compared to $7.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the third quarter was 16.3%, compared to 16.6% in the prior year period.\nPerformance Chemicals segment sales were $50.9 million, an increase of 9.4% compared to $46.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, on higher sales of both specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products predominantly from increased sales of surface coatings and an increase in sales of a fungicide used to prevent disease on pecan crops. Gross profit was $11.1 million, an increase of 13.9%, compared to $9.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was 21.9% for the third quarter compared to 21.0% in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was largely due to volume growth in both the Specialty Chemicals and Agricultural Protection Products businesses, while the increase in gross margin was driven by an improved sales mix of specialty chemical products.\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses were $28.0 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 5.7% versus the same period last year due to increases in professional fees and payroll benefits. Research and Development expenses in the third quarter totaled $2.5 million compared to $2.6 million in the prior year period. The majority of R&D expenses are milestone based and fluctuate quarterly.\nThe company recorded pre-tax non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $256.3 million in the third quarter related to Rising Pharmaceuticals. During the third quarter, Rising Pharmaceuticals had a decline in actual and forecasted revenue and earnings due to the persistent adverse conditions in the generics market. In addition, the company was notified by the U.S. Government that 11 generic drug products it acquired through its Acetris Health subsidiary in a product purchase agreement with Lucid are not in compliance with the TAA country-of-origin provisions of a clause contained in the government supply contracts acquired from Lucid. Based on these indicators, the company determined that it was necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis at March 31, 2018 for its Rising reporting unit. As such, the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $235.1 million and impairment charges of other identifiable intangible assets totaling $21.2 million.\nIncluding the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, the company reported an operating loss of $259.1 million versus operating income of $13.2 million in the prior year’s quarter. Net loss was $196.6 million, or $5.57 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was $0.2 million in the third quarter, compared to $13.6 million in the prior period. Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings per Share were $0.01 compared to $0.39 in the year ago third quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $65.1 million. As of March 31, 2018, the company was not in compliance with the Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio financial covenants. The company has obtained a waiver from its lenders for these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. In accordance with applicable accounting rules and standards, the company classified all indebtedness outstanding under its credit facility as a current liability as of March 31, 2018. Including the current portion of long-term debt, working capital was $52.4 million. Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, working capital was $243.2 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, operating activities provided cash of $56.4 million. Free cash flow, which the company defines to be operating cash flow less net cash used in investing activities, was $50.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. Investing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 used cash of $6.5 million primarily for purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. Financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 used cash of $44.7 million including $39.4 million of bank loan repayments and $5.9 million in cash dividend payments.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Dividend Declared\nThe Company's Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2018, payable on June 22, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 8, 2018.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the operating and financial results at 9:00 a.m. ET on Friday, May 4, 2018.

These measures, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, are based upon net income excluding amortization and impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, separation costs, amortization of debt discount, debt issuance costs and deferred financing costs, transaction costs related to acquisitions, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the impact of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09. These items should not be reviewed in isolation or considered substitutes of the Company’s financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Due to the nature of these items, it is important to identify these items and to review them in conjunction with the Company’s financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. The exclusion of these items also allows investors to compare results of operations in the current period to prior periods’ results based on the Company’s fundamental business performance and analyze the operating trends of the business. The exclusion of these items also allows management to evaluate the performance of its business units.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS to U.S. GAAP net income and GAAP EPS are presented in the Non-GAAP Reconciliation table of this press release.\nAbout ACETO\nACETO Corporation, incorporated in 1947, is focused on the global marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products (finished dosage form generics and nutraceutical products), Pharmaceutical Ingredients (pharmaceutical intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Performance Chemicals (specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products).
