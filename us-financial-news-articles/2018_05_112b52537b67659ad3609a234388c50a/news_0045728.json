Critics warn that the U.S.-backed Afghan military cannot promise to defeat the Taliban anytime soon or overcome Afghanistan’s vast political divisions and entrenched corruption.\nThe United States also has been unable to address safe-havens it says the Taliban enjoy in neighboring Pakistan.\nU.S. President Donald Trump had long identified with war-weary Americans skeptical about the Afghan war, even advocating withdrawal. But faced with the risks posed by the Taliban, he reversed himself and last August approved the more aggressive strategy that Nicholson has led, with mixed results.\nA U.S. government watchdog report released on Monday said there had been few signs of significant progress by Afghan security forces between January and March, despite assertions by the U.S. military that Taliban militants were weakened.\nNicholson, who leads U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, said in November the country had “turned the corner.”\nMore than 2,400 U.S. forces have died in the war.\nReporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali in Washington and James Mackenzie in Kabul; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T20:20:34.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
