Fierravanti-Wells has previously accused Beijing of funding \"roads to nowhere.\"\n\"It's really important to take into account the vulnerability of Pacific island countries,\" said Fierravanti-Wells.\nWhile the involvement of partners and donors to the region was welcome, she said, those investments need to examine the priorities of the Pacific and vulnerabilities of particular countries.\nFrom Australia's perspective, Fierravanti-Wells said, it has committed \"almost $4 billion\" for overseas development assistance efforts in the form of grants that are focused on the Pacific in a \"transparent, open manner.\"\n\"The issue, as I said, does come down to a general understanding and appreciation, in particularly the Pacific, a region that has a lot of vulnerabilities,\" she added, noting that small island states in the region are often located in remote locations with limited sources of revenue.\nIn reality, Fierravanti-Wells said, \"it's one thing if it's development assistance in the form of a grant as opposed to a loan because of course loans carry with them terms, they carry with them conditions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T11:01:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
