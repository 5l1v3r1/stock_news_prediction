(NASDAQ:AKAO), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative antibacterials addressing multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative infections, today reported first quarter ended March 31, 2018, and provided an update on its corporate and clinical development activities.\n\"With a unanimous vote earlier this week in favor of plazomicin for the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), we are laser-focused on the potential launch of our first drug,” said Blake Wise, Achaogen's Chief Executive Officer. “We remain committed to our vision of developing new treatment options for patients with serious bacterial infections.”\nRecent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nPlazomicin Advisory Committee Meeting : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee voted in favor of plazomicin for the treatment of cUTI, including pyelonephritis (15 to 0), and not in favor for the treatment of bloodstream infections (BSI) in adults with limited or no treatment options (4 to 11). Plazomicin PDUFA Date : The plazomicin Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is June 25, 2018. Should plazomicin receive approval by the target action date, the Company expects to launch plazomicin soon thereafter. Plazomicin commercial launch plans for the U.S. are in the advanced stages of development. Plazomicin Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) : Achaogen plans to submit a MAA to the European Medicines Agency in the second half of 2018. C-Scape Program : Based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, the Company now plans to conduct an additional Phase 1 clinical pharmacology trial. The additional Phase 1 trial is intended to optimize the likelihood of clinical and commercial success and will delay the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial beyond 2018. The FDA awarded Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) status to C-Scape for the treatment of cUTI in 2017.\nOther Corporate Milestones\nCARB-X Research Funding : The Company recently entered into an award agreement with CARB-X. Under the agreement, Achaogen was awarded up to $2.4 million, with the possibility of up to $9.6 million more. The collaboration will focus on the development of a next-generation broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic capable of overcoming clinically-relevant resistance mechanisms and potentially treating highly-resistant gram-negative pathogens.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash Position : At March 31, 2018, Achaogen had $144.0 million in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to $164.8 million at December 31, 2017. In February, Achaogen refinanced a $25.0 million secured debt line it had with Solar Capital with a new $50.0 million secured debt line with Silicon Valley Bank, and has drawn $25.0 million under the Silicon Valley Bank agreement to repay the Solar Capital facility. As previously disclosed, the Company issued 2,144,454 shares of common stock under its at-the-market equity facility for net proceeds, in the first quarter, of $24.0 million.\nRevenue : Contract revenue totaled $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $7.5 million for the same period of 2017. The decrease in contract revenue during the first quarter was primarily due to lower Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contract revenues. As of March 31, 2018, $9.6 million remains under the BARDA C-Scape contract and up to an additional $6.0 million may be available under BARDA contract options. All Achaogen revenue consists of U.S. government and Gates Foundation funding for the research and development of product candidates.\nResearch and Development (R&D): R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $30.9 million, compared to $18.6 million reported for the same period in 2017. The increase in R&D expenses during the quarter was primarily due to increases in headcount, facility expenses, external expenses related to plazomicin product supply, C-Scape and early research program expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A): G&A expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $15.1 million, compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in G&A expenses during the quarter was primarily due to increases in G&A headcount, facility expenses and expenses related to the potential commercialization of plazomicin.\nChange in warrant and derivative liabilities for the first quarter of 2018 was a $2.5 million loss compared to a $15.0 million loss for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability which is mainly driven by the change in our stock price.\nNet Loss : Achaogen reported a net loss of $47.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $33.3 million for the same period in 2017. Diluted net loss was $1.06 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to diluted net loss of $0.93 per share for the same period of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, there were approximately 44.8 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time / 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time.
