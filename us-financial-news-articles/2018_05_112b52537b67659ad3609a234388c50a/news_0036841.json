He said the militant belonged to Islamic State.\nIslamic State, which operates from the lawless border regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, has had worked in alliance with local militants such as the LeJ in several strikes in past.\nIslamic State did not immediately issue any statement claiming or disowning Badeni.\nEarlier this month members of the Hazara community went on a hunger strike in Quetta to protest against the spate of killings targeting them and to demand greater protection in the resource-rich province that has been plagued by violence and insurgency.\nOver the past couple of years Islamic State militants have also targeted the Hazara community in Baluchistan.\nThe Hazaras called off the protest after meeting with Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who vowed greater protection and promised those targeting Hazaras “shall suffer twice as much”.\nBajwa said on Thursday the army was determined to “sacrifice anything and everything” to defend the country. “When a soldier sacrifices his life I lose part flesh of my body,” he said at the funeral of the senior officer who died in the raid.\nViolence in Baluchistan is a worry for China, which has voiced concerns about security in the province that hosts a key route in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan’s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.\nIslamist militants have killed thousands of people in Pakistan since early 2000s, in their bid to impose a hardline version of Islam.
