Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest since April 2017 before easing back.\nOil prices held near 3-1/2-year highs on the easing trade tensions but trading was choppy after a brief dip into negative territory.\nU.S. crude rose 0.95 percent to $71.96 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.81, up 0.38 percent on the day.\nThe market kept an eye on Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro faced fresh international censure after his re-election in a vote denounced by his foes as a farce in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation.\nOil prices had been supported by plummeting Venezuelan production, in addition to solid global demand and supply concerns stemming from tensions in the Middle East.
