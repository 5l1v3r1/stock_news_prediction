REUTERS/Gustavo Graf The survey, taken between May 11 and May 15, showed Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, had 43 percent of support, up from 36.6 percent in a prior poll published in March.\nIn second place with 24 percent was Ricardo Anaya, a one-time leader of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), who fronts the challenge of a right-left coalition. His support grew slightly from 22.7 percent.\nJose Antonio Meade, running for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had 16 percent. Independent Jaime Rodriguez held 2 percent of support.\nThe results broadly follow other major polls that show Lopez Obradorâ€™s support growing and his rivals showing little sign of catching up.\nThe face-to-face poll of 1,000 people also included independent candidate Margarita Zavala, who dropped out of the race on Wednesday. The margin of error was 3.1 percentage points and 14 percent expressed no preference.\nReporting by Dave Graham; Writing by Christine Murray; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T04:40:30.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
