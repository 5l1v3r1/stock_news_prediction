REUTERS/Mariana Bazo/File Photo\nAs it stands, Guerrero will be able to play at the World Cup in Russia next month but he would miss out if a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) request for a stiffer sentence is accepted.\nPeru have qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 36 years and face Denmark, France and Australia in their first-round group.\nAround one dozen Peru fans were waiting at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) headquarters as Guerrero, who plays for Brazilian club Flamengo, arrived for Thursday’s hearing.\nGuerrero was suspended for a year by world football’s governing body FIFA on Dec. 8 after testing positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine after Peru’s 0-0 draw away to Argentina in October.\nFIFA then reduced the ban to six months and back-dated the start of the suspension period to Nov. 3, the day when he was provisionally banned. He is due to make his comeback in the Brazilian championship match against Internacional on Sunday.\nGuerrero, who has protested his innocence throughout, wants the ban quashed completely while WADA has also appealed and asked CAS to increase the sentence to between one and two years.\nThere was no immediate comment from CAS on when the ruling would be announced. However, such decisions can take anything from a few days to several months.\nGuerrero has scored 32 goals for Peru and helped them finish third in the 2011 and 2015 Copa Americas when he was leading scorer in both tournaments.
