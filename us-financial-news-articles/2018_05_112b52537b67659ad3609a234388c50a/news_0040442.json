With capacity of 15.6 million tonnes a year, it is one of the biggest in Europe.\nSouth Hook declined to comment beyond its public documents on the issue, which did not specify from which other countries it planned to source its LNG.\nHowever, analysts have noted the rapid expansion of U.S. LNG exports thanks to the launch of two liquefaction plants in the past two years, Sabine Pass in Louisiana and Cove Point in Maryland, to take advantage of domestic shale gas production.\nSurprisingly strong demand in the past year from China, South Korea and India has up-ended past predictions from industry watchers that there would be a glut of supply due to rising output from the United States, Russia and Australia.\nBroadly speaking, this meant Qatari LNG has been much in demand in Asia while Atlantic-based cargos have come to Europe. In Britain, South Hook’s quieter rival, Dragon LNG, has seen an uptick in its deliveries from a variety of sources.\nThe joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell and Malaysia’s Petronas received almost as much LNG so far this year as all of last year, including one of the first cargoes from Novatek’s Yamal LNG project in northern Russia and the maiden cargo from Dominion Energy’s Cove Point.\nDragon, which shares the Milford Haven port with South Hook, received four cargoes last year, all of them from Qatar, compared to six this year from Egypt, Trinidad, Russia and both U.S. terminals, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.
