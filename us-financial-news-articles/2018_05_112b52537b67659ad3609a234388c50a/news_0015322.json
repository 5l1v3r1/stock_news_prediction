Adoption of the FASB's new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018 is not reflected in reported 2017 financials. A comparable year-over-year view of reported 2018 results to unaudited pro forma 2017 results incorporating the impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition standard is provided in detail on pages 11-15 of this press release.\nTotal revenue in the first quarter increased 30% to $3.1 billion on a reported basis compared to the prior year period, including an increase of $365 million, or 17%, related to adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Excluding this impact, comparable revenue increased $344 million, or 13%, compared to the prior year period driven by a 5% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, a 5% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and 3% organic revenue growth.\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter increased 12% to $2.3 billion on a reported basis compared to the prior year period, including an increase of $78 million, or 4%, related to adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Excluding this impact, comparable expenses increased $167 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $99 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $66 million increase in operating expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, $54 million of accelerated amortization related to tradenames, a $12 million increase in expense related to certain hedging programs, and an increase in expense associated with 3% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $70 million decrease in restructuring charges and $52 million of incremental savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.\nRestructuring expenses were $74 , primarily driven by workforce reductions and other general initiatives. As previously announced, the Company expects to invest $1,175 million in total cash over a three-year period and incur $50 million of non-cash charges in driving one operating model across the firm. This includes an estimated investment of $975 million of cash restructuring charges and $200 million of capital expenditures. To date, the Company has incurred $571 million, or 56%, of the total estimated restructuring charges. An analysis of restructuring and related costs by type is detailed on page 18 of this press release.\nRestructuring savings in the first quarter related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives are estimated at $63 million before any reinvestment. Before any potential reinvestment of savings, restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives are expected to deliver run-rate savings of $450 million annually in 2019. To date, the Company has achieved $228 million, or 51%, of the total estimated annualized savings.\nForeign currency exchange rates in the first quarter had a $33 million, or $0.11 per share, favorable impact on reported net income if the Company were to translate prior year quarter results at current quarter foreign exchange rates. On a comparable basis, net income adjusted for certain items and the impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition standard includes a $57 million, or $0.19 per share, favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The Company also incurred $10 million, or $0.03 per share, of net losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies recorded in other expense. In addition, the prior year quarter benefited by a $12 million, or $0.04 per share, reduction in expense related to certain hedging programs.\nEffective tax rate reflected in the reported financial statements in the first quarter was 15.9%, compared to the prior year period of 0.1%. After adjusting for the impact from adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate on a comparable basis for was 16.5% compared to 13.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by changes in geographical distribution of income and the various impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods includes a net favorable impact from certain discrete items. Certain items that impacted first quarter results and comparisons with the prior year period are detailed in the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted for Changes in Accounting Guidance - Operating Income from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings Per Share\" on page 11 of this press release.\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 250.2 compared to 267.0 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 3.9 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $550 million in the quarter. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $4.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 CASH FLOW SUMMARY\nCash flow from operations for the first three months of 2018 decreased 23%, or $42 million, to $140 million compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting $98 million of cash restructuring charges, partially offset by operational improvement.\nFree cash flow , defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, decreased 36%, or $53 million, to $95 million for the first three months of 2018 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a decline in cash flow from operations and an $11 million increase in capital expenditures, including investments in our operating model.\nAdjusted free cash flow , defined as free cash flow excluding certain near-term impacts resulting from the divestiture of the outsourcing businesses, including restructuring initiatives, increased $28 million, or 16%, to $208 million compared to the prior year period. A reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to cash flow from operations can be found in \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue and Free Cash Flow\" on page 10 of this press release.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 REVENUE REVIEW\nThe first quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue and Free Cash Flow\" on page 10 of this press release.\nThree Months Ended\n(millions)\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\n%\nChange\nRevenue\nRecognition (1)\nLess:\nCurrency\nImpact (2)\nLess:\nFiduciary\nInvestment\nIncome (3)\nLess:\nAcquisitions,\nDivestitures\n& Other\nOrganic\nRevenue\nGrowth (4)\nRevenue\nCommercial Risk Solutions\n$\n1,184\n$\n984\n20%\n—%\n6%\n—%\n10%\n4%\nReinsurance Solutions\n742\n371\n100\n89\n4\n—\n1\n6\nRetirement Solutions\n424\n386\n10\n—\n6\n—\n4\n—\nHealth Solutions\n451\n372\n21\n16\n4\n—\n1\n—\nData & Analytic Services\n294\n268\n10\n2\n4\n—\n3\n1\nElimination\n(5)\n—\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal revenue\n$\n3,090\n$\n2,381\n30%\n17%\n5%\n—%\n5%\n3%\nTotal revenue increased 30%, or $709 million, on a reported basis, including an increase of $365 million, or 17%, related to adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

Organic revenue includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, and fiduciary investment income. The impact of foreign exchange is determined by translating last year's revenue, expense or net income at this year's foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental organic revenue information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above that do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activity less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow excluding certain near-term impacts resulting from the divestiture of the outsourcing businesses, including restructuring initiatives. The effective tax rate, as adjusted, excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated restructuring expenses, accelerated tradename amortization, impairment charges, regulatory and compliance provisions, and non-cash pension settlement related charges. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. They should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Estimated allocations between expense categories may be revised in future periods as these assumptions are updated.\n(3)\nOther costs associated with the Restructuring Plan include those to separate the Divested Business, as well as moving costs and consulting and legal fees.
