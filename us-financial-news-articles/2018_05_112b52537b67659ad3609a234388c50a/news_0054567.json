And, the president says something the next day,\" Roach said. \"It's, sort of, back and forth in terms of getting clear and direct messages in what to make of this.\"\nTrump has said he wants to impose tariffs on China as retaliation for a mammoth trade imbalance and alleged thefts of U.S intellectual property.\nRoach doesn't think the White House approach would be effective.\n\"Tariffs are a bad thing. Trade wars are not easy to win, as the president seems to suggest,\" he added.\nRoach warned it could have dire consequences for a stock market that's already vulnerable to another steep pullback.\n\"We had a valuation spike early this year. The market moved up parabolically in 2017. We've come off a little bit in the last four months,\" Roach said. \"But the price-earnings ratio that I look at cyclically, the adjusted price-earnings ratio, is still overextended by any standard of the imagination.\"\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
