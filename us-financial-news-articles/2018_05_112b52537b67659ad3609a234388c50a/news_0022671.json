It was great to get those wins against those few players. But there’s a reason I came up short today.\n“I go back to the drawing board and start over again.”\nSharapova looks unlikely to be seeded on her return to the French Open where she has won the title twice.\nLast year organizers declined to give her a wildcard after she returned from a 15-month doping ban for testing positive for heart drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.\nShe has managed only one title since returning and split with long-time coach Sven Groeneveld after losing in the first round at Indian Wells in March.\nShe said she was still driven to improve and did not regret the split with Groeneveld.\n“Post Indian Wells was a tough few weeks for me, I think I don’t know many people that would be like, ‘Let’s keep going’,” she said. “It was really tough. I was willing to make changes, willing to get back out there, willing to put in the work.\n“I think that attitude certainly helps, that perspective on things. When you try to make the right decisions for yourself in a very selfish sport, maybe somehow in the end it works out.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T22:57:15.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
