The ETF closed below that trend line late last week, but quickly rebounded to trade 1.6 percent higher.\n\"The key level on the downside here is $26.60,\" Wald said. \"These were the lows that had been put in place over the last month. We think a double bottom is forming here. Now the SPDR still has to get through $28.35 resistance.\"\nThe XLF has not closed below $26.60 since late November. However, it has not broken above its resistance level on an intraday basis since March 22.\n\"Again, given the rising trend, we think that's the trade,\" said Wald. \"We think you get the breakout to the upside.\"\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nThe financial sector saw a massive run-up following President Donald Trump 's election in November 2016, said Stacey Gilbert , market strategist at Susquehanna.\n\"This was the fan favorite once Trump won the election. You assumed that there'd be great deregulation, you assumed the yield curve was going to be steepening, you thought the economy was going to be growing, there'd be a ton of loan growth, all very positives for financials and financials responded,\" said Gilbert. \"They've outperformed the S&P by more than 10 percent.\"\nSince the 2016 presidential election, the XLF has soared more than 35 percent and hit its highest levels since 2007 earlier this year. Over that same period, the S&P 500 increased 25 percent.\n\"Interestingly, on the ETF side of financials, you've seen AUM in U.S. financials sector-specific ETFs ... grow by 50 percent to have about $63 billion of assets under management at this point,\" said Gilbert. \"This was definitely a much-loved sector.\"\nWhile the XLF has hit a rough patch over the past several months, Gilbert sees signs it could soon become a sector favorite once more.\n\"We continue to see bullish sentiment in the options, in the individual stocks,\" said Gilbert. \"Investors are taking this as an opportunity to position for further upside so reading the tea leaves through the options market, they do agree with the charts here that we are probably going to see more upside.\"\nThe financials sector was the second-best performer in the S&P 500 on Wednesday and in the week to date. It remains 0.5 percent lower for the year compared with a slight rise by the S&P 500.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T19:15:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
