Last year, though, incidents were down sharply on Labor Day weekend after police provided enhanced security at the annual J’Ouvert celebration in Brooklyn on Labor Day.\nThe parade celebrates the emancipation of slaves on the Caribbean Island of Trinidad, and there had been a history of crime near the festival.\nLast year there were three homicides from Saturday to Monday of Labor Day weekend, down from eight in 2016, and the lowest in years.\nIt is too soon to say what the 2018 holiday crime statistics will show. Rain and cool weather this week might keep activity low, the NYPD said.\nAt around midnight on Friday, Cheyenne Carter, a man in his early 20s was standing in front of a red brick tower in the Patterson Houses public-housing development in the Bronx’s Mott Haven neighborhood when a volley of shots rang out, police said. He was hit in the head and body, and pronounced dead at a hospital. Two men ran off, including one in a gray sweatshirt, police said.\nOn Monday morning, a 27-year-old man was shot in the neck and killed on a tree-lined block of 104th Street, the NYPD said. A few blocks away, another man crashed a car into a parked vehicle, and was found with a gunshot wound to his hand. A third man suffered a gunshot wound to his back, police said. The NYPD is investigating a connection between the men.\nThe weekend’s victims also include a woman standing outside a nightclub in Brooklyn on Friday who was shot in the abdomen and in the rear from the occupants of a passing vehicle.\nPolice said she is expected to survive. The occupants of the vehicle were later arrested, they added.\nWrite to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:09:36.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
