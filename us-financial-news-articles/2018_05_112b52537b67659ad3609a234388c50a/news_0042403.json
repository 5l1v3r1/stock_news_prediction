(“Spectra7” or the “Company”), a leading provider of high-performance analog semiconductor products for broadband connectivity markets, today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. All dollar amounts in this release are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\nQ1 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $0.9 million, representing a decrease of approximately 69% from the prior quarter. Spectra7 continues to have a strong position in the virtual reality (“VR”) and mixed reality (“MR”) markets, which experienced overall demand weakness in the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin 1 as a percentage of revenue was approximately 55%, consistent with the prior quarter. Non-IFRS expenses 2 were approximately $3.2 million, representing a decrease of approximately 16% from the prior quarter, while IFRS operating expenses were approximately $3.6 million, representing a decrease of approximately 12% from the prior quarter. The significant sequential decline in expenses is due primarily to restructuring in response to weak demand in the first quarter. The Company has strategically pivoted internal resources to better align with its strong traction of the data center market.\nCEO COMMENTARY\n“As anticipated when we released our fiscal 2017 results, demand for our VR and MR solutions was particularly weak following the strong holiday season,” said Spectra7 CEO Raouf Halim. “We continue to hold a dominant position in the tethered VR and MR markets and expect a stronger second half of 2018. We are encouraged by the continued increase of prototype data center revenues and believe the production ramp of our data center solutions will contribute meaningful revenue during the second half of 2018.”\nOther Quarterly Highlights\nData Center prototype revenue more than tripled in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior quarter and remains on track for production revenue to increase in the second half of 2018. The Company experienced continued strong customer engagement including 10 new Data Center design-ins in the first quarter of 2018. Data Center Equipment OEMs and interconnect suppliers continue development and qualification of Active Copper Cables for 100G and 400G applications with Spectra7 technology.\nOutlook\nThe Company has entered the second quarter of 2018 with increased VR backlog compared to the first quarter of 2018 and expects sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of 2018. Non-IFRS operating expenses are expected to remain stable, or decrease, in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2018, as the Company works to maintain operating expense discipline and identify opportunities to reduce costs. The Company is also pursuing strategic financing options after the repayment of the $6.5 million term loan.\nA copy of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and corresponding management’s discussion and analysis will be available under the Company’s profile on www.sedar.com .\nABOUT SPECTRA7 MICROSYSTEMS INC.\nSpectra7 Microsystems Inc. is a high performance analog semiconductor company delivering unprecedented bandwidth, speed and resolution to enable disruptive industrial design for leading electronics manufacturers in virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, data centers and other connectivity markets.
