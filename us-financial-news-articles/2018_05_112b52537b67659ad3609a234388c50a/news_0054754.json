It has also become a must-own stock for Wall Street investors, alongside Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet and Facebook.\nDisney, by comparison, has lost 5 percent over the past year as it and other one-time entertainment industry leaders struggle to adapt to the shift by global viewers to online video.\nDisney, with a stock market value of $152 billion on Thursday, is starting its own streaming service for families, and it has said it will stop supplying new movies to Netflix starting next year.\nEarlier this month, Netflix’s market capitalization overtook leading U.S. cable operator Comcast, which owns NBC and Universal Pictures. Its stock market value on Thursday was $145 billion.\nInvestors are bullish on Netflix’s ability to add more members and are paying red-hot prices to own its stock. Netflix recently traded at 98 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus Disney and Comcast at 14 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.
