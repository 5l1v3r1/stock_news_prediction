Of the 15 percent from ASC 606, 10 percent represented previously recognized revenue and 5 percent was from accelerated/deferred revenue.\nOperating income of $5.9 million declined $14.3 million from the year-ago period, including a restructuring charge of $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. Total segment operating profit of $29.4 million declined 2 percent, impacted by short-term operational execution issues and new product launch inefficiencies. Total segment operating profit included $13 million benefit from ASC 606, of which $7 million was related to previously recognized revenue and $6 million was associated with accelerated/deferred revenue.\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.05 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.58 for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.34 for the first quarter of 2018 excluding the restructuring charge. First quarter 2017 results included a $5.8 million, or $0.19 per share, discrete tax benefit associated with new accounting rules for stock compensation costs.\nOrders and Backlog\nFor the first quarter of 2018, inbound orders of $442 million increased 9 percent with record levels at FoodTech and strong performance from AeroTech. Backlog expanded 11 percent.\nRestructuring\nIn the first quarter of 2018, JBT recorded a restructuring charge of $12.7 million, part of a $50 million program to unlock the benefits of the Company's expanded global scale. \"We are reengineering processes for greater efficiency and flattening our organization to move closer to the customer and better leverage G&A resources,\" added Giacomini. \"We expect to generate run rate benefits of approximately $45 million, representing margin enhancement of more than 200 basis points by year-end 2019.\"\n2018 Outlook\nFor full-year 2018, JBT continues to expect organic revenue growth of 7 - 8 percent and 2 - 3 percent from acquisitions. In addition, the Company anticipates a 4 percent impact from ASC 606 and 1 - 2 percent from foreign exchange, for a total expected revenue growth of 14 - 17 percent. Due to the first quarter margin shortfall, the Company has lowered year-over-year projected FoodTech segment margin expansion to approximately 75 basis points with AeroTech improvement maintained at 50 - 75 basis points. With these changes and the restructuring charge, the Company forecasts diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.80 - $3.00 or $3.95 - $4.15 on an adjusted basis. This includes a projected ASC 606 benefit of $0.30 - $0.34 per share, versus prior guidance of $0.06 - $0.10 per share. The revenue and EPS impact from ASC 606 are subject to adjustment as orders develop throughout the year.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company anticipates revenue growth of 22 - 24 percent, including approximately 7 percent resulting from ASC 606. FoodTech and AeroTech segment margins are both expected to improve approximately 100 basis points year over year. Earnings from continuing operations is estimated at $0.80 - $0.87, or $1.00 - $1.07, adjusted for restructuring charges. These estimates include a $0.14 per share discrete tax benefit from accounting rules for stock compensation costs.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nA conference call is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 to discuss first-quarter 2018 financial results.

Further, we add back to EBITDA significant expenses that are not indicative of our ongoing operations to calculate an Adjusted EBITDA for the periods reported. Given the Company's focus on growth through strategic acquisitions, management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important non-GAAP financial measure. This measure allows us to monitor business performance while excluding the impact of amortization due to the step up in value of intangible assets, and the depreciation of fixed assets. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally to make operating decisions and believe this information is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results. This information is not intended to nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nJBT CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nRECONCILIATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE TO ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE\n(Unaudited and in cents)\nGuidance\nGuidance\nQ2 2018\nFull Year 2018\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations\n$0.80- $0.87\n$2.80- $3.00\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nRestructuring expense (1)\n0.28\n1.55\nImpact on tax provision from Non-GAAP adjustments (2)\n(0.08)\n(0.40)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations\n$1.00 - $1.07\n$3.95 - $4.15\n(1) Restructuring expense is estimated to be approximately $9.0 million and $50.0 million for second quarter and full year of 2018, respectively.

Corporate expense, restructuring expense, interest income and expense and income taxes are not allocated to the segments. Corporate expense generally includes corporate staff-related expense, stock-based compensation, pension and other postretirement benefit expenses not related to service, LIFO adjustments, certain foreign currency related gains and losses, and the impact of unusual or strategic events not representative of segment operations.\n(2) Total segment operating profit, as presented elsewhere in this release, is a non-GAAP measure. The table above includes a reconciliation of total segment operating profit to operating income.
