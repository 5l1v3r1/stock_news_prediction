Ltd. (the “Company” or “Liquor Stores”) (TSX:LIQ) today reported its results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n“As previously announced, we have commenced our strategic plan to regain our market leadership in liquor and establish a world-class cannabis business,” stated James Burns, Vice Chair and CEO, Liquor Stores N.A. Ltd. “As we focus on long-term value enhancement for our shareholders over the next two to three years, our results in the interim will need to be viewed in the context of the myriad of initiatives underway to become a dynamic growth-oriented company.”\nCommenting on the Q1 2018 financial results, Mr. Burns said: “While Canadian same-store sales were slightly negative during the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to the extreme and prolonged winter weather experienced in Alberta, we believe, based on information from our vendors and market intelligence, that our sales decline was less than the declines experienced by our competitors and that we increased our market share in Alberta in Q1 2018.”\n“We are confident that we are taking the right steps to reposition and re-energize our liquor brands, attack the discount competition head-on, and create a whole new recreational cannabis retail network.” Mr. Burns continued. “We have the financial strength to excel and we will use that strength to its best advantage.”\nFor the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nConsolidated sales were $125.8 million, down 0.9% from Q1 2017 (before accounting for the decline related to the foreign exchange impact of translating our $USD sales to $CAD). Canadian same-store sales 1 were $93.9 million, down 1.8% from $95.6 million in Q1 2017. U.S. same-store sales 1 were $17.1 million USD, up 1.8% from $16.8 million USD in Q1 2017. Operating loss before amortization 1 was $2.3 million, down from $1.5 million profit in Q1 2017. Net loss from continuing operations was $1.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $2.9 million in Q1 2017.\n1 Same-store sales and operating (loss) profit before amortization are non-IFRS measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS.
