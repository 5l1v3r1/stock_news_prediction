But even titles do not provide adequate protection, and people are frequently forced off of their farms without proper legal process or compensation, activists say.\nDisputes over land have increased significantly since the easing of political and economic restrictions began in 2011. The reforms led to a rush of foreign investments and greater demand for land for industrial use.\nGovernment officials say projects including mining, hydropower and large-scale agriculture are essential for development in one of the world’s poorest countries.\nThe Thilawa SEZ, in the country’s south, is the first SEZ project developed by the Myanmar government, and covers about 600 hectares.\nThe government recently introduced a national land-use policy to give farmers more rights, and has adopted dispute resolution mechanisms.\nBut transactions are often characterized by a lack of consultation and consent from affected communities, inadequate compensation, the absence of a resettlement policy and a lack of judicial remedies, activists say.\nAlongside, arrests and prosecution of protesters and land activists have risen.\nThe reforms “offer little or no protections to tenant farmers and do not protect customary land use,” Hardman said.\n“Worryingly, a series of proposed amendments actually increases both the scope of criminal offences and the length of sentences that farmers could be given,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
