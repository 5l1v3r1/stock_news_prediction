The shortest test lasted four seconds and flew for five miles.\nOne report, according to the sources, did not mention health or environmental risks posed by damages to the missile's nuclear reactor.\nThe weapon, which has been in development since the early 2000s, is believed to use a gasoline-powered engine for takeoff before switching to a nuclear-powered one for flight, sources explained to CNBC.\nThe tests apparently showed that the nuclear-powered heart of the cruise missile failed to initiate and, therefore, the weapon was unable to achieve the indefinite flight Putin had boasted about.\nshow chapters Russia's new hypersonic weapon will likely be ready for war by 2020, says US intel 12:43 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 01:37 Sources said that the tests were ordered by senior Kremlin officials despite objections from the program's engineers, who voiced concerns that the system was still in its infancy.\nDuring a state of the nation address in March, Putin claimed the cruise missile was capable of delivering a warhead to any point in the world while evading missile defense systems. In the same two-hour speech, Putin touted an arsenal of new hypersonic weapons which he called \"invincible.\"\nA week ago, CNBC learned the hypersonic glide vehicle, a weapon the U.S. currently is unable to defend against, will be ready for war by 2020 .\nThe sources, who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said Russia successfully tested the weapon, which could carry a nuclear warhead, twice in 2016. The third known test of the device was carried out in October 2017 and resulted in a failure when the platform crashed seconds before striking its target.\nThe Russians are expected to conduct a fourth test sometime this summer.\nshow chapters China and Russia are pursuing hypersonic weapons — and the US can't defend against them 11:00 AM ET Wed, 21 March 2018 | 00:50", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T00:11:12.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
