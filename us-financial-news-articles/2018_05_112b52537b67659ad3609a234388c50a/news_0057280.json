Vekselberg now owns 48.8 percent of Sulzer shares, Reuters data shows.\n“In line with its reduced shareholding and new status as a minority shareholder of Sulzer, Renova has elected to reduce its board representation effective immediately,” Sulzer said in a statement.\nSulzer’s board will consist of seven members, three of whom represent Renova. They are Chairman Peter Loescher, a former Siemens boss, Rusal board member Marco Musetti, who will replace Heitmann on the board’s audit committee, and Mikhail Lifshitz.\nSwiss steelmaker Schmolz & Bichenbach and sports car manufacturer Porsche have also been affected by the sanctions Washington imposed to punish Moscow for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity”.\nIn April Schmolz & Bickenbach’s chairman severed contractual ties to Renova after bond underwriters demanded it as a condition of a forthcoming transaction, a Renova spokesman said at the time. Vekselberg owns a large minority stake.\nAdditionally, Siegfried Wolf this month abstained from taking a seat on the board of Porsche Automobil Holding, the family controlled investment vehicle that controls a majority stake in Volkswagen< VOWG_p.DE>, because of fears the move could cause sanctions trouble.\nWolf serves as chairman of the supervisory board of the Russian car manufacturer GAZ Group, co-owned by tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who also faces U.S. sanctions.\nVekselberg-related sanctions fallout has also hit numerous European banks, including JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and UBS, which had been under pressure because of more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) in loans made to the billionaire.\nVekselberg and his Renova Group repaid the loans this month, Renova and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, helping to avert a potential sale of Sulzer, Schmolz & Bickenbach and OC Oerlikon shares that the banks were holding as collateral.
