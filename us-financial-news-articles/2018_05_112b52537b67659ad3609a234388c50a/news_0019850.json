That tool was put in place to let people dispute inaccuracies in their Equifax credit files.\nThe disclosure came via an SEC filing which provided more detail on the data elements stolen in the attack. Congressional committees received the information last Friday, according to the filing.\n“The statement provided additional detail on the data elements stolen in the cybersecurity incident related to those U.S. consumers and was made in response to, and as part of the Company’s ongoing cooperation with, government requests for information,” Equifax wrote.\nIn the statement, the company also reconfirmed exactly how many people had been impacted, breaking it down by specific data elements.\nDespite such tremendous losses, many companies have yet to change their habits. As of earlier this month, thousands of companies have continued to introduce the same security holes into their computer networks.
