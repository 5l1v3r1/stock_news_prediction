(NYSE American:APT), a leading manufacturer of products designed to protect people, products and environments, including disposable protective apparel and building products, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nLloyd Hoffman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alpha Pro Tech, commented, “Increased sales in the first quarter were led by growth in our Building Supply segment, specifically our housewrap and other woven material products. After nine consecutive quarters of growth in housewrap sales, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from further increases in demand, which are expected to be driven by the ongoing recovery in construction activity and an increased focus on building weatherization technologies and strategies.”\nHoffman continued, “Our first quarter operating expenses include an accrual for an expense associated with an attorneys’ fee claim resulting from a protracted litigation matter that we initially filed against one of the Company’s competitors. As a result of a recent mediation with that party, we have reached a settlement, the amount of which has been fully accrued for in our financial statements and significantly impacted our net income for the first quarter. We are in the process of evaluating avenues for the potential recovery of the settlement amount from former litigation counsel.”\nNet sales\nConsolidated sales for the first quarter of 2018 were up by 6.4% to $11.4 million, compared to $10.8 million for the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 12.3% increase in Building Supply segment sales and a 1.6% increase in Infection Control segment sales, which was partially offset by a 1.9% decrease in sales in the Disposable Protective Apparel segment.\nBuilding Supply segment sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by 12.3% to $6.7 million, compared to $5.9 million for the same period of 2017. This segment increase was primarily due to a 19.0% increase in sales of housewrap and a 114.2% increase in sales of other woven material, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in sales of synthetic roof underlayment (including REX™, TECHNOply™ and the new TECHNO SB®). The sales mix of the Building Supply segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 47% for synthetic roof underlayment, 44% for housewrap and 9% for other woven material, compared to 54% for synthetic roof underlayment, 41% for housewrap and 5% for other woven material for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nSales for the Disposable Protective Apparel segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 1.9% to $3.2 million, compared to $3.3 million for the same period of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales to the Company’s major international supply chain partner and national distributors, which was partially offset by an increase in sales to the Company’s regional distributors.\nInfection Control segment sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by $24,000, or 1.6%, to $1.54 million, compared to $1.52 million for the same period of 2017. Mask sales were up 1.4%, or $16,000, to $1.1 million, and shield sales were up 1.8%, or $8,000, to $446,000.\nGross profit\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 3.7% to $4.5 million, or 38.9% gross profit margin, compared to $4.3 million, or 39.9% gross profit margin, for the same period of 2017. Gross margin in the Building Supply segment was affected by a change in the product mix from the premium REX™ synthetic underlayment to the lower priced TECHNO family of products. Gross margin in the Disposable Protective Apparel segment was affected by increased rebates. Management expects gross profit margin to be reduced in 2018 but still to be in the high thirty percent range.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $407,000, or 11.7%, to $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.5 million for the same period of 2017, primarily as a result of the litigation settlement expense discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 33.9% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, up from 32.3% for the same period of 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $92,000, compared to $222,000 for the same period of 2017. The estimated effective tax rate was 15.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 28.8% for the same period of 2017. The lower effective rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 was due to U.S. tax reform (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017).\nNet income\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $508,000, compared to $550,000 for the same period of 2017, a decrease of $42,000, or 7.6%. Net income as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter of 2018 was 4.4%, compared to 5.1% for the first quarter of 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $0.04 per basic and diluted share.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had a cash balance of $5.7 million, compared to $8.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash was primarily the result of cash used in operating activities of $2.5 million, due to an increase in accounts receivable of $1.9 million and an increase in prepaid inventory of $0.8 million. Also affecting cash was cash used in financing activities of $499,000, primarily cash used for the repurchase of common stock, and cash used in investing activities of $102,000. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had working capital of $24.2 million and a current ratio of 10:1.\nInventory was $10.6 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $10.2 million as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $386,000, or 3.8%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in inventory for the Disposable Protective Apparel segment of $73,000, or 2.1%, to $3.5 million, an increase in inventory for the Building Supply segment of $225,000, or 4.9%, to $4.8 million, and an increase in inventory for the Infection Control segment of $88,000, or 4.0%, to $2.3 million.\nColleen McDonald, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “At the end of the first quarter of 2018, we had $1.7 million available for additional stock purchases under our stock repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 153,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $576,000, bringing the program total to 16,357,007 shares of common stock at a cost of $29.5 million since inception. All stock is retired upon repurchase, and future repurchases are expected to be funded from cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities.”\nThe Company currently has no outstanding debt and maintains an unused $3.5 million credit facility. Management believes that current cash balances and the borrowings available under its credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy projected working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.\nAbout Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd.\nAlpha Pro Tech, Ltd. is the parent company of Alpha Pro Tech, Inc. and Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc.
