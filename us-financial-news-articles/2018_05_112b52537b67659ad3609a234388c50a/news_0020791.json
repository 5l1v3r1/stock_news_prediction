Its share at the end of 2017 was 5.6 percent.\n\"We believe food and drug presents the largest multi-year growth opportunity for Amazon,\" Feldman wrote. \"The shift to online grocery is being driven by consumers' increasing comfort with buying almost anything online, along with greater product availability and improvement in the supply chain to offer faster delivery.\n\"The rollout of Prime Now grocery, a service that delivers products in one-hour and two-hours, should be a game changer.\"\nThe company recently announced that it will raise the price of premium Prime membership to $119 a year from $99 on May 11. Prime benefits fall into five basic categories: shipping, shopping, streaming, reading and various extras. Membership now exceeds 100 million.\nTelsey Advisory Group â€” founded by veteran retail analyst Dana Telsey in 2006 3 set a price target of $1,900 on shares of Amazon , implying 20 percent upside over the next 12 months.
