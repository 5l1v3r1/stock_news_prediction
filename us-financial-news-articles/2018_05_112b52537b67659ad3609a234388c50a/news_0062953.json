Growth accelerated from an upwardly revised rate of 0.2 percent in the prior quarter, compared to the previously reported 0.1 percent.\nGDP rose 1.2 percent from the first quarter of 2017, slightly below a 1.3 percent consensus estimate.\nHousehold spending continued to grow as record-low interest rates and low inflation bolstered consumers’ purchasing power. Capital spending rose for a fourth straight quarter, although more slowly than in the two prior quarters amid uncertainty about general elections coming in October.\nA Reuters poll last week showed most economists expected the economy to accelerate in coming quarters, turning the page on a recession that shaved nearly 8 percent off GDP in 2015-16.\nSome may begin to question those optimistic outlooks after a truckers protest over the past 10 days blocked major highways and hurt several sectors of the economy.\n“If the effects of the truckers’ strike are limited to May, it won’t significantly impact second-quarter figures. But it could trigger protests from other groups, generating economic noise, dampening sentiment and lowering GDP,” said Haitong economist Flavio Serrano.\nThe median estimate for 2018 GDP growth fell to 2.37 percent in a weekly central bank survey of economists published on Monday, from 2.5 percent a week before.\nThat would suggest downward pressure to the government’s official 2.5 percent forecast, which it already reduced this month following a string of underwhelming economic indicators.\nYields on interest rate futures fell in early trading amid a global rebound in demand for riskier emerging-market assets, while the Brazilian real strengthened.\nWith unemployment at double digits and companies grappling with widespread idle capacity, the economic recovery is unlikely to lift inflation, currently hovering below the central bank’s target range.\nThat should allow the bank to keep interest rates at all-time lows for a long time, according to economist forecasts, providing additional support to the economy.\nMaintaining steady growth will hinge on the government’s ability to cut spending and curb growth of public debt, a burden that will likely fall to the next president.
