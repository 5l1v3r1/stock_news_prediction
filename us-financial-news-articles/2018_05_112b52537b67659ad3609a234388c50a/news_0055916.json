It also often allows for a speedy resumption after a rain delay.\n“I would think that they would have to play the ball up,” American world number three Thompson said on Tuesday, meaning preferred lies.\n“I played it yesterday and it was pretty wet in some spots and some of the fairways are a little bare in some spots.\n“The rain has not helped that situation... so I think it will be a little unfair if they don’t.”\nBut world number one Park In-bee sounded ready to play the ball as it lies.\n“I’ll be surprised if they play lift, clean and place,” said the 2008 and 2013 winner.\n“Coming into the U.S. Women’s Open, I always try to play the ball with mud or try to play with wet ground conditions because we’ve never played lift, clean and place,” said the South Korean.\n“We just play from wherever it is and however the condition is. These are probably the wettest conditions I have ever seen in the U.S. Women’s Open. We don’t know how bad it’s going to be.”\nUSGA officials were scheduled to issue an update on the course condition later on Tuesday.\nSouth Korean Park Sung-hyun is the defending champion at Shoal Creek, which last hosted a men’s major in 1990, when Australian Wayne Grady won the PGA Championship.
