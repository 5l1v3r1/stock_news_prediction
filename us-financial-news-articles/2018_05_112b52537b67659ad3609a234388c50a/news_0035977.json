Whilst looking forward to his next challenge, he would like to wish the Club every success next season.”\nThe departure of former Aston Villa and Norwich City boss Lambert leaves Stoke looking for a third permanent manager in a year.\nBritish media reports have linked former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes with the Stoke hot seat after the Scot parted company with West Ham United on Wednesday.
