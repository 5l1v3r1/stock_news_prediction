The market should pay high attention to the risk brought by speculation,” an NDRC official was Quote: d as saying.\nBenchmark thermal coal futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange have gained more than 7 percent over the past month, reaching 643 yuan ($100.83) a ton on Wednesday, the highest level since late February.\nTo bring coal prices back within a “reasonable price range”, the NDRC will encourage miners to boost output — adding at least 300,000 tonnes a day from mines in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia.\nNDRC puts reasonable coal prices at 500-750 yuan a ton.\nThe state planner expects coal output in the three regions to increase by about 250 million tonnes this year. Combined coal production in these area was 2.3 billion tonnes last year, accounting for two thirds of the country’s total coal output.\nPlans are also being made to improve rail capacity for coal transportation from miners in the western part of the country to coal-fired power plants in eastern regions.\nThe NDRC also said it will ontroduce 100 million tonnes of new coal capacity this year to ensure stable supplies in the market.\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Vincent Lee; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:57:46.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
