REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo\nPortuguese house prices have risen sharply in the past couple of years, boosted by tourism and demand from foreign buyers who have snapped up properties in Lisbon which have been relatively cheap compared with other European capitals.\nThe National Statistics Institute said house prices in the Lisbon area rose 18.1 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to an average of 1,262 euros per square meter. In Porto house prices rose 17.6 percent. FILE PHOTO: An old facade of a building is seen at the Ribeira neighbourhood in Porto August 25, 2014. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo\nAcross all of Portugal, average house prices rose 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to 932 euros per square meter.\nAnalysts have said they expect house prices to continue rising in Portugal this year, pushed by continued demand by foreign buyers. Record tourism numbers are also contributing as demand for short-term rental properties has risen strongly, especially in the main cities.\nThe housing boom helped propel economic growth to its highest level in nearly two decades last year. The expansion should continue this year, although at a slightly lower rate.
