In all, 13 protesters have been killed this week.\nResidents and environmental activists say emissions from the plant, India’s second biggest, are polluting the air and water, affecting people’s health.

The pollution control board of Tamil Nadu said the smelter, which was shut pending renewal of its operating license, was found last week to be preparing to resume production without permission.\nA company spokesman did not respond to a Reuters’ email seeking comment on Tamil Nadu’s closure plan and the allegation that it had been preparing to resume production without approvals.\nIn a statement late on Thursday, it said only that it was working with authorities to restore power to the plant, which has been offline since March 27.
