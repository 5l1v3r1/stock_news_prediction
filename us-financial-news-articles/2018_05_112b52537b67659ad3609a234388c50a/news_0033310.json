(\"Mountain Province\", the \"Company\") (TSX and NASDAQ: MPVD) today announces Stuart Brown's appointment as the new President and Chief Executive Officer with effect from July 1, 2018.\nMr. Brown has over 25 years of experience in the diamond industry, where he has gained a wealth of experience across all aspects throughout the diamond pipeline from exploration, mine development and operations to the selling and marketing of diamonds. In 2006, after numerous roles within De Beers over a period of 14 years, Mr. Brown was appointed as the De Beers Group Chief Financial Officer. He held that position for over five years, and in 2010 was appointed joint acting CEO to run De Beers' global activities in addition to his CFO duties. Since September 2013, Mr. Brown has been the CEO of publicly-listed Firestone Diamonds Plc, a diamond producer in Lesotho. Mr. Brown was responsible for securing the funding and building the team that delivered the successful construction and transition to production of Firestone's Liqhobong diamond mine. Mr. Brown has an enviable track record of leading business transformation to develop lean, agile and high performing organisations. Mr. Brown holds a Bachelor of Accounting Science from the University of South Africa.\nJonathan Comerford, Mountain Province's Non Executive Chairman, commented, \"We are very pleased to announce Stuart Brown as our new CEO. The Board conducted an exhaustive search for the role, and Stuart was a stand out candidate for the depth of his background in the diamond sector. Stuart has incredible experience in the space, having held the highest positions in De Beers. He is also very familiar with the Gahcho Kué diamond mine and its team from his time with De Beers. Mountain Province is building a strong team to execute our strategy of exploration and mining extension, and we are confident that Stuart's experience, both in De Beers and with Firestone, and his standing in the diamond industry will add substantial value to the Company.\"\nMr. Comerford continued, \"On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank David Whittle for stepping in as Interim CEO last June. Over the past year, he has done a tremendous job of leading the company through a difficult period with the successful refinancing of Mountain Province's bank debt. He also completed the acquisition of Kennady Diamonds, which added significant long term value for the Company's Shareholders. I am delighted that David will remain on the Mountain Province Board, resuming his roles as both the Senior Non Executive Director and as Head of the Audit Committee.\"\nMountain Province Diamonds is a 49% participant with De Beers Canada in the Gahcho Kué diamond mine located in Canada's Northwest Territories. Gahcho Kué is the world's largest new diamond mine, consisting of a cluster of four diamondiferous kimberlites, three of which are being developed and mined under the initial 12 year mine plan.\nCaution Regarding Forward Looking Information\nThis news release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" under applicable Canadian and United States securities laws concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Mountain Province Diamonds Inc.

Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of Mountain Province and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.\nFactors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such forward-looking statements include variations in ore grade or recovery rates, changes in market conditions, changes in project parameters, mine sequencing; production rates; cash flow; risks relating to the availability and timeliness of permitting and governmental approvals; supply of, and demand for, diamonds; fluctuating commodity prices and currency exchange rates, the possibility of project cost overruns or unanticipated costs and expenses, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry, failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\nThese factors are discussed in greater detail in Mountain Province's most recent Annual Information Form and in the most recent MD&A filed on SEDAR, which also provide additional general assumptions in connection with these statements. Mountain Province cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Investors and others who base themselves on forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail.
