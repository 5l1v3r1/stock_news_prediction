Foley, II. “On April 26, 2018, Ceridian successfully completed its initial public offering of 24,150,000 million shares of common stock at a price of $22.00 per share. Ceridian raised approximately $590 million in net proceeds which it used to repay debt. Concurrent with the IPO, Cannae participated in a private placement whereby the Company purchased an additional 1,521,030 common shares of Ceridian stock at the IPO price, which brings Cannae’s total ownership in Ceridian to 37,135,921 common shares. Based on CDAY’s closing price of $32.95 per share on May 8, 2018, Cannae’s ownership position is worth approximately $1.2 billion.”\nMr. Foley continued, “We signed a non-binding letter of intent in March with Newport Holdings to reorganize our respective equity interests in American Blue Ribbon Holdings. The proposed reorganization will leave Cannae with approximately 94% ownership in 99 Restaurants and O’Charley’s along with an approximately 5% interest in Family Dining and Legendary Baking. Upon completion of the reorganization, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, our restaurant group will be greatly simplified, and American Blue Ribbon’s management team will be able to focus their attention on two large restaurant concepts which have similar market facing attributes. Looking forward, we see significant room for operational improvement and are working with ABRH’s management team to reduce expenses, increase productivity and improve customer satisfaction levels across our brands.”\n“Turning to T-System, we are pleased with the Company’s results in the first quarter of 2018, which showed strong growth from the first quarter of 2017, driven by new customer wins in their Documentation Software division and a heavy flu season which increased volume in the Coding Solutions division. Looking forward, we believe T-System is well positioned to increase market share with the expectation of continued organic growth as well as the addition of selective add-on acquisitions to broaden the Company’s product capabilities and customer base.”\nMr. Foley concluded, “Looking forward, we are continuing to seek attractive investment opportunities as we evaluate opportunities for capital re-investment.”\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Cannae will host a conference call tomorrow, May 10, 2018, to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization as a percent of revenue (EBITDA margin).\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations, LifeWorks EBITDA, sponsor management fees, non-cash charges for asset impairments, gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary, non-cash share-based compensation expense, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, and environmental reserve charges. HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage HCM Adjusted EBITDA is of Total HCM Revenue.\nThree Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollar in millions) HCM operating profit $ 27.3 $ 10.9 Depreciation and amortization 13.9 13.1 HCM EBITDA from continuing operations 41.2 24.0 Sponsorship management fees 0.5 0.5 Intercompany foreign exchange loss (gain) (2.8 ) 0.8 Share-based compensation 2.7 4.2 Severance charges 1.9 1.9 Restructuring consulting fees 0.1 (0.2 ) HCM Adjusted EBITDA $ 43.6 $ 31.2 Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, Cannae's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided below.\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors\nThis press release contains that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
