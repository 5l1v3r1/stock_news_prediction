REUTERS/Grigory Dukor Trump dangled the possibility on Friday that a June 12 summit with Kim could still take place, just a day after he canceled the meeting citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility”.\nSpeaking at an economic forum in the Russian city of St Petersburg, Abe said a summit could be a key factor in peace talks on the Korean peninsula after years of tension over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program, but he also cautioned:\n“Dialogue for the sake of dialogue is senseless.”\nAbe said countries should also try to ensure that Pyongyang continued taking action on its nuclear weapons program.\nThe Japanese premier said North Korea should be obliged to meet certain conditions, such as denuclearisation, the return of abducted people and fulfilling UN resolutions, before being allowed to discuss long-term partnership with other countries.\nAbe said North Korea should make the right choice so that its people can live in prosperity and that it was very important that Pyongyang fulfilled all United Nations resolutions on the full denuclearisation of the country.\nReporting by Christian Lowe, Denis Pinchuk and Katya Golubkova; Writing by Maria Tsvetkova and Tom Balmforth; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T22:59:55.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
