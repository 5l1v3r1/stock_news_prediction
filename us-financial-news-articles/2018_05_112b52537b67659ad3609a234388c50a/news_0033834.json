You don’t feel relaxed until that ball finds land on 17. So once that happened, internally I was celebrating.”\nSimpson dedicated the victory to his parents — his late father Sam who died last November, and his mother Debbie back home in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n“My dad got me started in the game,” Simpson said.\n“He kept me in other sports but he could tell that I was better in golf.\n“I also felt unconditional love from my mum no matter how I played.” Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ian Ransom/Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T06:33:38.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
