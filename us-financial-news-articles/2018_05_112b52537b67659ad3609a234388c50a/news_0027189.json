Swissport has received a forbearance fee of 150,000 euros, included in the $100 million payment,” it said.\nSwissport continues to earn a market interest rate on the residual amount, it added.\nHNA has been unloading billions of dollars of assets after a $50 billion acquisition spree over two years turned a spotlight on its opaque ownership and aggressive use of leverage. The firm has since seen some pending deals collapse.\n($1 = 0.8442 euros)\nReporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Vyas Mohan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:46:09.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
