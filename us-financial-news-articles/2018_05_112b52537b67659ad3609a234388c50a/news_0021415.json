They have since eased to around $187 a tonne.\nStrong auto sales in Asia, where the company operates auto dealers, and solid performance in the firm’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) business also supported profits, Masu added.\nMitsubishi’s results follow record earnings last week from Itochu. Mitsui, Sumitomo and Marubeni also booked growth in annual profits on Tuesday, with Sumitomo and Marubeni renewing their record profits.\nFor this year, Mitsubishi forecast its net profit would grow 7 percent to a record of 600 billion yen, above a mean estimate of 568 billion yen from nine analysts.\nIts rivals also predicted profit growth for this year.\nTo reflect healthy earnings, Mitsubishi increased its annual dividend for the last year to 110 yen per share from 80 yen a year earlier, while forecasting 115 yen for this year. The other trading houses also boosted their dividends for the period.
