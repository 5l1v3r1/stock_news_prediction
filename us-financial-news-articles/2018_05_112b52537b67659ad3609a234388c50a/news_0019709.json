Two were found dead and two others have been rescued.\nJSW Chief Executive Daniel Ozon said the next steps would be to drill a new borehole, pump out water and send in divers from the copper and silver mining firm KGHM.\n“These actions take place in extreme conditions. The priority is to free these people, at a minimized risk for the rescuers,” he said, putting faith in the trapped miners’ “knowledge, experience and intuition”.\nAbout 250 people were working underground at the time of the quake. The missing miners were in a team drilling a new tunnel.\nThe 3.5-4.0 magnitude quake was the strongest recorded in the mine, officials there said.\nAround 83,000 people work in Poland’s coal mining sector. Fifteen miners died in 2017, and eight have died so far this year.\nReporting by Agnieszka Barteczko; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:11:43.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
