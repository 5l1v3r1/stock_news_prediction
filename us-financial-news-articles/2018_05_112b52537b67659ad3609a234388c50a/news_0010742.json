(NYSE:ZTS) today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and reaffirmed its guidance for full year 2018.\nThe company reported revenue of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $352 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, an increase of 48% and 50%, respectively, on a reported basis. This increase includes the benefit of a lower effective tax rate in 2018 as a result of the new tax legislation enacted in the U.S. last year.\nAdjusted net income 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $365 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, an increase of 40% and 42%, respectively, on a reported basis. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 excludes the net impact of $13 million for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items.\nOn an operational 2 basis, revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased 7%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 increased 34% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign currency.\nEXECUTIVE COMMENTARY\n“We continue generating profitable revenue growth thanks to the quality and diversity of our portfolio, the innovations we bring to the market and the value we deliver to our customers,” said Juan Ramón Alaix, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. “We remain confident in the strength of our company and our ability to offer customers more integrated solutions across the entire cycle of healthcare -- from prediction and prevention to detection and treatment. With this approach and our proven business model, we can generate long-term growth for Zoetis and value for our shareholders.”\nQUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS\nZoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two regional segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the first quarter of 2018:\nRevenue in the International segment was $726 million, an increase of 18% on a reported basis and 11% operationally compared with the first quarter of 2017. Sales of companion animal products grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% on an operational basis, resulting primarily from increased sales across multiple international markets of our dermatology portfolio and new products including Simparica ® (sarolaner), our oral parasiticide, as well as growth in vaccines in China. Sales of livestock products grew 14% on a reported basis and 7% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in poultry and cattle. Growth in poultry products was driven by increased sales of medicated feed additives, primarily in emerging markets. Cattle products grew due to the colder weather increasing treatments and strong demand for vaccines in Mexico. Strong demand in other emerging markets also contributed to growth. Revenue in the U.S. segment was $634 million, an increase of 5% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Sales of companion animal products grew 6% driven by increased sales in our dermatology portfolio, as well as new products. This growth was partially offset by lower sales of certain in-line products due to expected competition. Sales of livestock products grew 4%, led by cattle and poultry and a return to growth in our swine business. Growth of cattle products was driven by favorable conditions in the beef market, including higher feedlot placements and variable weather conditions, which drove higher disease risk and incidence. Growth was partially offset by unfavorable market conditions in dairy, including declining producer profitability due to low milk prices. For poultry products, growth was driven by increased sales of medicated feed additive products.\nZoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse portfolio through the introduction of new products, lifecycle innovations, business development initiatives, strong customer relationships and entry into new markets and technologies. In the first quarter of 2018:\nZoetis broadened its Fostera ® swine vaccine franchise with approval in the U.S. of Fostera Gold PCV MH . This is the first vaccine to contain both genotypes of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) – 2a and 2b – and a study showed it provided cross protection against the leading 2d genotype. It also provides 23 weeks of immunity for PCV and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo), the longest duration for commercial PCV2 combination vaccines. The company continued to bring leading companion animal products to new markets. Cytopoint ® (lokivetmab), part of Zoetis’ canine dermatology portfolio, was approved in Mexico and Switzerland. Additionally, Simparica, an oral parasiticide, was approved in Thailand and Serbia. Simparica delivers fast and persistent protection from fleas and ticks in dogs, with effectiveness that lasts for a full 35 days, without losing efficacy at the end of the month. Zoetis also received approvals in new geographies for several major cattle products. Inforce™ 3 , the first and only intranasal vaccine that prevents respiratory disease caused by Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus while also aiding in the prevention of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis and Parainfluenza Virus 3, was approved in Korea and Egypt. Additionally, Spectramast ® DC , which helps treat mastitis in dairy cows, was approved in China.\nFINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nZoetis is reaffirming its full year 2018 guidance, which includes:\nRevenue between $5.675 billion to $5.800 billion Reported diluted EPS between $2.77 to $2.93 Adjusted diluted EPS between $2.96 to $3.10\nThis guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-April.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance or actions. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if management's underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Zoetis expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors because they provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by GAAP, such as net income, operating income, and earnings per share, and should not be considered measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release and are posted on our website at www.zoetis.com .\nInternet Posting of Information: We routinely post information that may be important to investors in the 'Investors' section of our website at www.zoetis.com , on our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/zoetis and on Twitter @zoetis .

Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.

(b) Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. (c) We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. (d) Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to restructuring and other charges for the supply network strategy. Excludes potential net gains/losses on sales of assets.
