On the occasions we’ve had him available to play for us over the last few years, he’s made some great contributions,” Durham head coach Jon Lewis said in a statement.\n“He comes back to us with a big point to prove and is eager to nail down his spot in the England test side.\n“The IPL didn’t give him the playing opportunities he would have liked but he has still learnt from great players and this is a move which suits all parties.” (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T11:28:50.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
