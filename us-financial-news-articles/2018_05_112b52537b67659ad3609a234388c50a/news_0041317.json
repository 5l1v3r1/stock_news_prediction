Both had their worst first-quarter price performances in history, with bitcoin losing over $119 billion in value in three months.\nRecently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other foreign entities have been pushing to regulate digital currencies, putting pressure on prices.\nIn the case of PayPal, some have also raised questions about Square's competing service, Square Cash, in light of its ability to process bitcoin transactions .\nBut while some market-watchers still ardently back crypto , Rainey told Cramer that PayPal will proceed with a bit more caution.\n\"You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don't accept it, it's of little value,\" Rainey said. \"Right now, we don't see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it's something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that.\"\nWatch John Rainey's full interview here: show chapters PayPal CFO sees opportunity in consumers who have mobile devices, but not bank accounts 2 Hours Ago | 09:06 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of PayPal.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:24:02.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
