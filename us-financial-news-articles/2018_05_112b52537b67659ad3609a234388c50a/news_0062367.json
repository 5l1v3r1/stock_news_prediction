FILE PHOTO: Containers of Danone's Dannon Yogurt are displayed in a supermarket in New York City, U.S., February 15, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nThe confidential settlement between Dannon, a unit of France’s Danone SA ( DANO.PA ), and Federico Muyshondt, who oversaw sales in the eastern United States and to supermarket chain Kroger Co ( KR.N ), was disclosed in filings on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in White Plains, New York.\nDannon accused Muyshondt, of Mount Kisco, New York, of forwarding or downloading confidential data in the five months before he resigned on Jan. 16, which was four days after he received a “substantial” six-figure bonus.\nMuyshondt represented that he has not used or shared Dannon’s trade secrets and confidential information, and has returned all documents and electronic media that may contain both, one of the filings showed. He also agreed to delete such information from his private email accounts.\nDannon and Chobani, known for its Greek yogurt, are major brands in the roughly $8.8 billion (£6.6 billion) U.S. yogurt market.\nChobani was not a defendant in the case, whose dismissal was approved by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains.\nThe case is Dannon Co v Muyshondt, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01567.
