This is the first of what the Company expects will be a series of product acquisitions designed to generate revenue and strengthen its financial position.\n“We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of the PANCREAZE product rights for the U.S. and Canadian territories. The acquisition, coupled with today’s announcement to restructure a portion of our convertible debt with Athyrium Capital Management, are demonstrations of our plan to create a stronger and more financially capable VIVUS,” said John Amos, new Chief Executive Officer at VIVUS. “We hope that the combination of a new product for us to promote along with the strengthening of our balance sheet will serve as initial stepping stones in our value creating strategic vision.

It is associated with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis, and affects approximately 85 percent of cystic fibrosis patients. There is no cure for EPI and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the main treatment for the condition.\nApproved in 2010, PANCREAZE is a pancreatic enzyme preparation consisting of pancrelipase, an extract derived from porcine pancreatic glands, as well as other enzyme classes, including porcine-derived lipases, proteases and amylases. The pancreatic enzymes in PANCREAZE act like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas. PANCREAZE is specifically indicated for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions. Upon closing, VIVUS will acquire PANCREAZE from Janssen for $135 million.\nAbout PANCREAZE\nPANCREAZE is a prescription medicine used to treat people who cannot digest food normally because their pancreas does not make enough enzymes due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions.
