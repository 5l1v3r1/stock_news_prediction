Ouicar provides a platform for drivers to hire a car from private owners, rather than through hire car companies.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is locked in a battle with rail unions over his plans to create a leaner, more efficient SNCF that could better stand up to foreign competition once its monopoly ends.\nUnions say the reform is a first step towards privatization. Macron’s government says it has no plans to open the rail company up to private capital.
