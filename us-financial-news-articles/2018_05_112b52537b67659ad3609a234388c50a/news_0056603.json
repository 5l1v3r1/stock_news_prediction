He resigned in September 2015.\nDays later the charity said concerns had been raised about inappropriate comments and behavior by Forsyth in 2011 and before he left the agency in 2015.\nReviews in both cases resulted in “unreserved apologies” to the women involved but the human resources processes had not been followed in every aspect, the charity said.\nForsyth subsequently resigned as the deputy director of the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF), saying he did not want coverage of past mistakes to damage the organization.\nParker told MPs on the International Development Committee he was pretty certain that harassment claims against Forsyth were not mentioned to head-hunters looking to recruit him for his new role, as the cases had been settled informally.\n“I think it is the policy of the organization not to mention things if they haven’t been subject to a formal disciplinary process,” Parker said.\nHe denied being friends with Forsyth, something media reports suggested might have affected how the case was dealt with, characterizing their relationship as professional.\nIn February, Forsyth’s successor Kevin Watkins called for a global screening system for the aid sector to keep sexual predators out of humanitarian operations. nL8N1QG67E\nA similar tool was announced by the U.N. earlier this month.\nThe aid sector was rocked earlier this year by reports that some staff at Oxfam, one of the biggest disaster relief charities, paid for sex in Haiti during a relief mission after a 2010 earthquake.\nCharities have since pledged to overhaul their approach to dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment.\nAn exclusive survey by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in February found more than 120 staff from leading global charities were fired or lost their jobs in 2017 over sexual misconduct.\nParker said Save the Children had fallen short in its response.\n“I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize again personally, unreservedly and on behalf of the organization,” he said.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Claire Cozens.
