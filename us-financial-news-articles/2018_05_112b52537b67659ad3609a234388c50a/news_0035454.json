REUTERS/Eric Vidal “We are open for improving our trade relations... but it’s not a concession in order to get a permanent exemption from higher steel and aluminium tariffs,” Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen told a news conference.\nWashington has been granted the EU a temporary exemption from import tariffs on steel and aluminium until June 1.\n“There’s no reason for those tariffs... It wouldn’t be logical to give up under pressure that is unjustified. We don’t negotiate under any kind of threat,” Katainen said.\nHe said that the EU remained interested in improving trade relations with the U.S. but “before entering any kind of negotiations, if it ever happens, we have to get support from the EU member states and that’s another question,” he told a news conference.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Francesco Guarascio\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
