Lots and lots of tremors,” said Cindy Conda, whose house lies just east of Leilani Estates where 27 homes have been torched by lava in the last eight days.\nConda said that at a meeting Thursday night, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientist Steve Brantley told residents that lava that has lain dormant in the area since a 1955 eruption was being forced to the surface by Kilauea’s activity.\n“He said ‘That lava’s underneath your house,’” said Conda. “Really it’s worrying, we’ve been doing a lot of praying. There is not much else you can do.”\nThe first steam-driven explosive eruptions on Kilauea in nearly a century may soon begin, dusting downwind communities with ash that is an eye and respiratory irritant, observatory scientists said.\nThe national park around the summit was closed to visitors on Thursday, given the risk that the eruptions could launch refrigerator-sized “ballistic blocks” over half a mile and hurl pebble-sized projectiles for miles.\nResidents of Kona on the west coast of the island have complained of volcanic smog, or vog, from the large amounts of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants spewing from Kilauea.\nHawaii’s governor warned that mass evacuations may be required in the lower Puna district as more fissures open.\nKilauea’s eruption began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed in a cloud of ash, triggering a plunge in the lava lake inside the larger summit crater.
