Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports Right-hander Dennis Santana was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City in a corresponding move.\nMaeda exited against the Phillies with two outs in the second inning. He allowed two runs on three hits prior to his departure after 38 pitches. Manager Dave Roberts said after the game that Maeda would need to miss at least one start, though Maeda’s timetable is unclear after an MRI on Wednesday revealed the strain.\nMaeda, 30, is 4-4 with a 3.61 ERA in 11 games (10 starts) this season. He joins fellow rotation members Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill and Hyun-Jin Ryu on the DL, though Kershaw (left biceps tendinitis) and Hill (left middle finger blister) each threw simulated games Saturday and are nearing their respective returns.\n—Minnesota Twins center fielder Byron Buxton is headed to the disabled list for the second time this season as the result of a fractured left big toe, the team announced. Right-handed pitcher Aaron Slegers was recalled from Triple-A Rochester in a corresponding move.\nBuxton first injured his toe on April 22 while on a rehab assignment following a DL stint for migraine headaches. Between the two issues, the 24-year-old missed 21 games, returning to Minnesota on May 10. He has played 17 games since then, though he was forced out early from a contest against the Seattle Mariners over the weekend when he crashed into the outfield wall trying to make a catch and had the wind knocked out of him.\nBuxton told reporters he has been playing through the foot pain. He will have an X-ray and MRI to determine if he has sustained any additional damage to the area. Buxton is hitting .156 in 28 games this season.\n—The San Francisco Giants placed right-hander Jeff Samardzija on the 10-day disabled list due to right shoulder tightness, recalling right-hander Tyler Beede from Triple-A Sacramento in a corresponding move.\nSamardzija exited his start against the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday after one inning as a result of the tightness in his throwing shoulder. He gave up two runs on three hits before departing after throwing 23 pitches. Giants manager Bruce Bochy said Samardzija will miss at least one start but isn’t expected to be out long.\nThe Giants are shuffling their rotation for the weekend, with Ty Blach moving to the bullpen along with Beede. Andrew Suarez is due to take Blach’s turn on Saturday against the Philadelphia Phillies. In Samardzija’s turn Sunday, Dereck Rodriguez likely will get his first major league start, Bochy hinted.\n—Chicago Cubs right-hander Yu Darvish underwent an MRI exam on his pitching arm and no structural damage was detected, the team announced.\nDarvish is currently on the 10-day DL due to a right triceps injury. The MRI displayed inflammation in the triceps, according to the Cubs, who expect the 31-year-old to begin throwing again in a few days after he was scratched from his scheduled Sunday start due to the discomfort.\nChicago also placed right-handed reliever Carl Edwards Jr. on the 10-day disabled list with right shoulder inflammation. To take his place on the 25-man roster, the Cubs recalled right-hander Cory Mazzoni from Triple-A Iowa.\n—The Milwaukee Brewers recalled struggling shortstop Orlando Arcia from Triple-A Colorado Springs less than a week after sending him down, and the 23-year-old instantly rewarded the team with the game-winning RBI in its afternoon game against the St. Louis Cardinals.\nArcia, who rejoined the Brewers with shortstop Tyler Saladino headed to the DL with a sprained ankle, drove in Jesus Aguilar with a single in the seventh inning for a 3-2 lead that would stand as the final. Arcia entered the game as a defensive replacement in the top of the seventh.\nX-rays on Saladino’s ankle were negative, but the injury was bad enough that he was seen on crutches in the morning.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
