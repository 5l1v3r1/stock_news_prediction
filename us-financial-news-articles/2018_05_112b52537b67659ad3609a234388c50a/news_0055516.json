(TSX-V:YOO) (OTC:YOOIF), the leading secure digital media management and distribution company, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31 st , 2018.\nRevenue for Q1 was $1,949,090, 12% higher than in the same period in 2017 and 2% higher than Q4 2017. Normalized EBITDA for Q1 of $179,566 increased by 49% over the same period in 2017 and increased by 19% over the previous quarter. Net income in Q1 was $84,971, 159% improvement over Q1 2017 and 4% decrease over Q4 2017.\nAdvertising revenue of $1,229,455 in Q1, marked a 20% increase over the same period in 2017 and 4% increase over the previous quarter. The increase in revenue was a result of continuous growth in new customers and increased sales volumes with existing customers.\nEntertainment revenue remains flat. Revenue in Q1 2018 was $719,635, up 1% over Q1 2017 and down 1% over previous quarter. Higher awards management revenue was recorded in the quarter but offset by a general decline in volume of video delivery and subscription fees.\n“Starting in the second quarter of last year, the Company initiated a change of leadership and rebuilding of the sales team in the Advertising business,” said Gary Moss, President and CEO of YANGAROO. “Additionally, the mandate of the team was adjusted to focus on larger customer opportunities and during the last half of 2017, the team started to build a pipeline of target deals. Closing sales to larger customers is a more lengthy process. During the first quarter, this new pipeline started to deliver meaningful new customer wins. The Company is confident that the flow of new customer wins from the team will continue into the future and will support the growth of Advertising revenues especially in the last half of 2018.”\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1,901,097, 14% higher than the previous year and 5% higher than the previous quarter. Income from operations in Q1 was $47,993, 28% lower than the previous year and 53% lower than the previous quarter. The changes were primarily due to higher value of stock options granted and salary adjustments taken place in Q1 2018. Excluding the impact of non-cash and non-operating costs, the first quarter of 2018 had a normalized cash flow of $179,566.\nSummary of operating results for first quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nFirst Quarter $CDN 2018 2017 Revenue 1,949,090 1,740,066 EBITDA 131,066 74,189 Normalized EBITDA 179,566 120,513 Net income for the period 84,971 32,849 Income per share (basic & diluted) 0.001 0.001 Please note, all currency in this press release is denoted in Canadian dollars.\nThe full text of the financial statements and Management Discussion & Analysis is available at www.yangaroo.com and at www.sedar.com .\nAbout YANGAROO:\nYANGAROO is a company dedicated to digital media management.
