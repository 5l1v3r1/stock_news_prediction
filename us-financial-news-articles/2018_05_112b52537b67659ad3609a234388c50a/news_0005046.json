It is not a mechanism for overturning the referendum,” the spokesman said ahead of a debate in the upper house of parliament on the legislation that will end Britain’s EU membership.\nAmendments to that legislation to give parliament a greater say over final deal would weaken Britain’s negotiating position, the spokesman said.
