The Quds Force is an elite unit in charge of the IRGC’s overseas operations.\nThe six individuals and three entities, including front companies for the IRGC-QF and currency traders, were sanctioned under U.S. regulations targeting specially designated global terrorist suspects and Iranian financial activity, the Treasury said.\nThe UAE said later it had placed the same companies and people on its list of terrorist and terrorist organizations doing business with the IRGC-QF.\nThe crackdown comes as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushes allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to pressure Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear and missile programs.\nTrump’s decision has given grace periods of 90 days to six months for companies to wind down their trade with Iran.\nThe Treasury Department said one of the companies sanctioned was also involved in retrieving oil revenue from foreign bank accounts held by the Iranian central bank for IRGC-QF activities.\nIn February 2015, Reuters reported that at least $1 billion in cash had been smuggled into Iran despite sanctions. Before it reached Iran, the cash was passed through money changers and front companies in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, sources told Reuters.\nBefore the 2015 nuclear deal was reached, front companies had mushroomed in Dubai to facilitate payments to Iran. The use of multiple front companies, which bought dollars from currency traders in Dubai and Iraq, was preferred as it concealed the overall size of the dollar-purchasing operation.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton; Additional reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:21:59.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
