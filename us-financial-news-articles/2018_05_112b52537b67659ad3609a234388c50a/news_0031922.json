REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The decline, which is likely to be partly offset by growing sales of drugs such as bowel disease treatment Entyvio and heartburn and ulcer drug Takecab, underscores Takeda’s need to bolster its pipeline. It also comes days after it agreed to a record-breaking $62 billion deal to acquire London-listed Shire ( SHP.L ).\nProfit for the year ended March 2018 grew 55 percent to 241.8 billion yen ($2.21 billion) - its highest in six years.\nEntyvio sales grew 41 percent to 201.4 billion yen, with Takecab sales up 62 percent to 55.1 billion yen. Velcade sales fell 0.2 percent to 137.3 billion yen.\nThe Shire acquisition is expected to add strength in rare diseases and blood-derived therapies to Takeda’s three core areas of gastroenterology, oncology and neuroscience. It will also result in the U.S. market accounting for almost half of sales from a third currently.\nRare disease treatments are seen as more sheltered from price pressures in the U.S. affecting areas like oncology.\nThe Shire deal could close by the end of the year, Chief Executive Christopher Weber said last week. Remaining hurdles include receiving regulatory and shareholder approval.\nReporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:58:37.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
