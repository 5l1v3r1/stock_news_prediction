They are Namibia, Palau, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and the three U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nThe EU blacklist was set up last December after revelations of widespread tax avoidance schemes used by corporations and wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills. It originally included 17 jurisdictions.\n“Having fewer jurisdictions on the list is a measure of the success of the listing process”, said Vladislav Goranov, minister for finance of Bulgaria, which currently holds the EU presidency.\nFair tax groups and EU lawmakers have criticized the rapid shrinking of the list and the fact that renowned tax avoidance countries are not listed.\nBlacklisted jurisdictions could face reputational damage and stricter controls on their financial transactions with the EU, although no sanctions have been agreed by member states yet.\nThose who are on the grey list could be moved to the blacklist if they do not honor their commitments.\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio; editing by David Stamp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:54:28.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
