And fans might get a glimpse of its star, John Travolta, who is back in Cannes promoting his new film, “Gotti”, about a New York gangster.\nIn 1978, Travolta, already a global sensation thanks to “Saturday Night Fever”, came to the Cannes Film Festival to promote “Grease”, a huge hit that also made him a music star with songs from the soundtrack dominating the charts.\n“The mid-point was ‘Pulp Fiction’, so it was 40 year, 20 year and now today,” Travolta reminisced.\n“My mother always told me when I was younger: ‘Don’t rush things, it’s going to go very fast’, and boom, here I am,” he told Reuters.\n“I’ve lived a long life but it has really gone fast.”\nCult crime flick “Pulp Fiction” won Cannes’ Palme d’Or top prize in 1994, giving a second wind to Travolta’s career. 71st Cannes Film Festival - Cannes, France, May 14, 2018.

Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston, co-stars as Gotti’s wife and the mother of their son who refuses to follow his father into the mob.\n“He is very different from what I am and who I am and how I think and my values,” Travolta said of playing the gangster.\n“It’s a completely different person - that’s something fun to play.”\nGetting the film made, he said, was far less fun: “The challenges kept on knocking us down – different directors, different casts, different scripts – one was too shoot-‘em-up , one was too family,” he said.\n“People like challenges and I was willing to stay with it til we saw it through.”\nThe Cannes Film Festival runs until May 19.
