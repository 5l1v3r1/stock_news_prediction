Both firms have headquarters in Oklahoma City.\nThe acquired assets include the Thunderbird Midstream cryogenic natural gas plant with 20 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMcf/d) processing capacity. The plant began operations in 2016 and is located on more than 40 acres to allow for expansion to meet increased demand. The Thunderbird assets provide immediate processing capacity with additional firm market outlets for residue and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”).\nThe transaction includes a 34 mile natural gas pipeline gathering system. The acquisition continues the buildout of GSPM’s infrastructure in the prolific STACK play of northwestern Oklahoma.\n“We are adding to our system to serve multiple producers in the northwest portion of the STACK,” said Rusty Rains, CEO of GSPM. “We are now offering immediate natural gas processing services. The additional gathering pipeline from Thunderbird extends our system west into Major County, providing producers with low pressure gathering and additional residue market optionality.”\nGSPM also has a state-of-the-art cryogenic processing facility under construction in Major County, Oklahoma, called the Silver Lake Plant, which will have an initial capacity to process up to 70 MMcf/d, with expansion capacity of up to 220 MMcf/d. Additionally, GSPM is constructing over 90 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and multiple compressor stations and expects the new facilities to be in service in July 2018.\nAbout Great Salt Plains Midstream\nGreat Salt Plains Midstream (“GSPM”) is a joint venture providing midstream services to producers in the STACK play.
