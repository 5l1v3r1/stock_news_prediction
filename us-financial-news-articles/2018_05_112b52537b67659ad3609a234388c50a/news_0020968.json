(\"SRHI\" or the \"Company\") today announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. SRHI is a publicly-listed diversified resource holding company focused on owning cash-flowing businesses and businesses expected to cash flow in the natural resource sector.\nThe Company's current principal operating business is its 70% equity interest in the Chilean producing copper mine Minera Tres Valles (\"MTV\") that was acquired in October 2017. MTV's main asset is the Tres Valles mining complex, in the Province of Choapa, Chile and includes fully integrated processing operations and two active mines. Mineralized material is extracted from the Don Gabriel open pit mine (\"Don Gabriel\") and the Papomono Massive underground mine (\"Papomono Massive\"), both of which are located approximately 10 kilometers north of Salamanca, Chile with the heap leach pads and solvent-extraction and electrowinning processing plant located approximately 7 kilometers north of Salamanca.\nThe Company's financial reporting changed effective February 1, 2018 resulting in MTV's treatment as a consolidated controlled entity. As a result, certain comparative information, although provided, is not meaningful in the majority of circumstances. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company began reporting in US dollars and has retrospectively applied this presentation in its most recently reported financial results. Readers are cautioned that previously filed reports of the Company are presented in Canadian dollars.\nFirst Quarter Results and Highlights\nKey corporate initiatives\nOn March 29, 2018, SRHI filed a report entitled “NI 43-101 F1 Technical Report Mineral Resource Estimate, Chloride Leach Processing, and Don Gabriel Manto Pit Expansion”, dated March 29, 2018 with an effective date of March 29, 2018:\nDon Gabriel Manto Feasibility Study\n• Don Gabriel Manto Feasibility Study almost triples production from current production rates, to levels of approximately 14 million pounds of copper per year over a six-year mineral reserve life\n• Mine plan based on mineral reserves of 5.17 million tonnes at 0.81% CuT at a copper cut-off grade of 0.25%\n• Vecchiola S.A., a related-party to MTV's minority shareholder, has been selected as the open pit mining contractor\nSalt Leach Pre-Feasibility Study\n• Potential to increase copper recoveries by 10%, reduce leaching cycle by up to 40% and reduce sulfuric acid consumption by up to 40%\n• Estimated capital cost of USD$6.9 million, which includes the activities from detailed engineering to the end of construction\n• Implementation timeline of 11 months has an expected payback period of less than two years - expected completion is in mid-2019\nCorporate Activity Highlights\n• Wood plc (formerly AMEC Foster Wheeler), an independent consulting firm, has commenced a pre-feasibility level underground mining study on the Papomono Massive underground deposit and has also commenced a preliminary economic assessment level study on six ancillary deposits surrounding the Don Gabriel and Papomono Massive deposits\nMTV operating performance for two months ended March 31, 2018\nMined a total of 38 thousand tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.65% copper from the Don Gabriel open pit Mined a total of 52 thousand tonnes of ore at a grade of 1.10% copper from the Papomono Massive underground deposit Revenue for the period of $6.0 million was generated from the sale of 827 tonnes of copper and tolling charges for mineralized material supplied by Empresa Nacional de Mineria (\"ENAMI\"), a Chilean state-owned minerals company Gross profit for the period was $254 thousand Cash cost per pound of copper produced for the period 2 was $2.43 Realized price per pound of copper sold was $3.14 Total exploration and capital expenditures for the period totaled $192 thousand focused on engineering services for the technical reports and purchases of equipment\nCompany financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2018\nAs at March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $29.1 million and net working capital 4 of $44.8 million Adjusted EBITDA 3 from continuing operations was negative $1.0 million and the unrealized loss on portfolio investments was $6.4 million Net loss for the quarter was $8.7 million or $0.01 per share\nSteve Yuzpe, CEO of SRHI remarked, \"During the first quarter of 2018, we continued the development of our most significant holding, the MTV copper mine in Chile. In March, we received the first technical reports, which confirmed our estimates regarding the potential of the asset. These reports detail the open pit expansion and conversion of the processing plant to chloride leach in order to increase recoveries and shorten the leaching cycle time. Additional technical reports outlining the expansion of underground production are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018.\"\n\"We are very pleased with the progress the MTV management team has made on their mine plan as they begin to increase production from the open pit,\" continued Mr. Yuzpe. \"We recently finalized the selection of a mining contractor to advance the mine plan and eventually triple production from the open pit at a lower cost. MTV's board of directors selected Vecchiola S.A. as the mining contractor and the Company views this as a positive development for shareholders, as the new contractor owns a minority stake in MTV, which provides additional incentive to deliver strong and reliable service.\"\nMr. Yuzpe added, \"As the MTV management team transitions to the new mining contractor at the end of the second quarter of this year, we expect some production disruptions that will be evident in our quarterly results and metrics with a higher cost of production in the second and third quarters. However, these disruptions will be temporary as the change in contractors is expected to meaningfully reduce the operating costs of MTV going forward.\"\nThe following operating and financial highlights are for the three months ended March 31, 2018 with comparative information, where appropriate.
