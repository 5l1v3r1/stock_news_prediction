Adjusted net income attributable to JHG, adjusted for one-time non-cash and acquisition and transaction related costs, of US$143.6 million decreased 3% compared to US$147.9 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and improved 40% compared to US$102.3 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in the first quarter 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 diluted earnings per share was US$0.82 compared to US$2.32 in the fourth quarter 2017 and US$0.38 in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of US$0.71 decreased 3% compared to US$0.73 in the fourth quarter 2017 and improved 42% versus US$0.50 on a pro forma adjusted basis in the first quarter 2017.\nAs at 31 March 2018, the Group had achieved US$96 million of annualised run rate pre-tax net cost synergies, inclusive of the impact from the expanded strategic relationship with BNP Paribas, which closed at the end of the first quarter. The Group continues to expect it will be able to realise recurring annual run rate pre-tax net cost synergies of at least US$125 million within three years post merger close.\nAndrew Formica and Dick Weil, co-Chief Executive Officers of Janus Henderson Group plc, said:\n“Against the backdrop of elevated market volatility, we are pleased to have maintained robust investment performance through the quarter. As an active asset manager, dynamics like those seen in the first quarter allow us to demonstrate our value to clients in helping them achieve their long-term financial goals.\n“As we approach our first anniversary as Janus Henderson, we are pleased with the pace of integration and that we have already exceeded our Year One target of US$90 million in run rate net cost synergies. We remain disciplined in our financial investment and focus on sustainable growth, and are delighted to announce an increase in the quarterly dividend, underlining the Board’s confidence in the future cash flow generating capabilities of our business”.\nThe Group presents its financial results in US$ and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”). However, in the opinion of Management, the profitability of the Group and its ongoing operations is best evaluated using additional non-GAAP financial measures on a pro forma adjusted basis. See adjusted statements of income reconciliation for additional information.\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS (unaudited)\nThree months ended 31 Mar 31 Dec 31 Mar (in US$ millions, except per share data or as noted) 2018 2017 2017 GAAP basis:\nRevenue 587.7 621.8 233.0 Operating expenses 411.5 425.2 182.2 Operating income 176.2 196.6 50.8 Operating margin 30.0 % 31.6 % 21.8% Net income attributable to JHG 165.2 471.7 42.6 Diluted earnings per share 0.82 2.32 0.38 Three months ended 31 Mar (in US$ millions, except per share data or as noted) 31 Mar\n2018\n31 Dec\n2017\n2017\n(pro forma)\nAdjusted basis 1 :\nRevenue 470.4 505.3 406.0 Operating expenses 281.6 284.9 262.4 Operating income 188.8 220.4 143.6 Operating margin 40.1 % 43.6 % 35.4 % Net income attributable to JHG 143.6 147.9 102.3 Diluted earnings per share 0.71 0.73 0.50 As a result of revenue recognition accounting guidance that came into effect in 2018, the Group’s presentation of distribution expenses under US GAAP is now reported on a gross basis. As a consequence, the Group reclassified prior year amounts to conform to the 2018 presentation. The change in presentation does not affect the Group’s reporting on an adjusted basis as distribution expenses are netted against revenue.\nFirst quarter 2018 adjusted revenue of US$470.4 million decreased from the fourth quarter 2017 result of US$505.3 million due to lower performance fees. Management fees grew 1% with the increase in assets under management through the period partially offset by two fewer business days in the quarter. First quarter 2018 adjusted operating income of US$188.8 million decreased from US$220.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017, driven by lower performance fees.\nDIVIDEND\nOn 8 May 2018, the Board of Directors of Janus Henderson Group (the “Board”) declared a first quarter dividend in respect of the three months ended 31 March 2018 of US$0.36 per share, a 13% increase from the previous level. Shareholders on the register on the record date of 21 May 2018 will be paid the dividend on 1 June 2018.

Janus Henderson Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from revenues in the computation of net revenue reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the Group’s managed AUM. 2 Adjustments primarily represent deal and integration costs in relation to the merger. These costs primarily represent severance costs, legal costs, consulting fees and the write down of legacy IT systems. Janus Henderson Management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 3 Investment management contracts have been identified as a separately identifiable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses. Such contracts are recognised at the net present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the contracts at the date of acquisition. For segregated mandate contracts, the intangible asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contracts. Janus Henderson Management believes these non-cash and acquisition related costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 4 Adjustments primarily represent the gain on the sale of JHG’s back office (including fund administration and fund accounting), middle office and custody functions in the US to BNP Paribas, fair value movements on options issued to Dai-ichi, adjustments to debt expense as a result of the fair value uplift on debt due to acquisition accounting and deferred consideration costs associated with acquisitions prior to the merger. Janus Henderson Management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 5 The tax impact of the adjustments are calculated based on the US or foreign statutory tax rate as they relate to each adjustment. Certain adjustments are either not taxable or not tax deductible.
