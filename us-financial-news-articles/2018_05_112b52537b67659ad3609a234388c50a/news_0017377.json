According to those figures, Slack's year-to-year user growth has decelerated from about 83 percent in May 2017 to about 45 percent now.\n\"I dont expect to see the same exponential growth Slack initially had now that the market is more competitive than when they first launched,\" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. \"Seeing a million new paid users added is a very positive result.\"\nSlack also did not provide an update on its annual recurring revenue (ARR) as it did in September, saying active and paid users are better metrics for measuring the company's growth.\n\"We continue to see very healthy growth of ARR, however at this stage in our evolution as a company its not an indicator we intend to use publicly moving forward,\" a Slack spokeswoman said in a statement.\nBy comparison, Microsoft Teams is used by 200,000 organizations. Microsoft, however, does not disclose Teams active user count.\nAt its Build developer conference, Microsoft announced a series of upcoming developer tools for Teams that will make it easier to create apps for the workplace collaboration product. That will include tools to easily port already-built solutions from Microsoft SharePoint, said Larry Jin, Microsoft senior program manager for Teams.\n\"You can take your existing solution in SharePoint and bring that into Teams without any work,\" Jin told Reuters on Monday.
