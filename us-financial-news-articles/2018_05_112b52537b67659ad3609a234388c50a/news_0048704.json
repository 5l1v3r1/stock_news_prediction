Kuwait Finance House is leading the Islamic tranche and National Bank of Kuwait the conventional one, with Gulf Bank and Commercial Bank of Kuwait also involved.\nState-owned KPC plans to invest more than $500 billion by 2040 as it aims to boost its crude oil production capacity to 4.75 million barrels per day by then.\nKPC expects to spend $114 billion in capex over the next five years and an additional $394 billion beyond that to 2040, Chief Executive Nizar al-Adsani said this year.
