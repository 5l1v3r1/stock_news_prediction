Similar to how Foursquare users can create and follow “Lists,” Yelp users can add notes and descriptions to individual business locations saved in their Collections, either writing them more colorfully like a restaurant review or just a reminder as to why they might have saved the location to the collection in the first place.\nBut that’s not all. Like most social networks as well as sites that rely on crowd-sourced content from its users, Yelp wants to keep visitors around even longer.\nTo do so, Yelp will be relying on more machine learning technology to populate a new section called “Recommended For You.” Given that the terminology is already employed by everyone from YouTube to Amazon , the concept isn’t unique, but it could be quite helpful for users coming to Yelp to inspect one thing, find themselves disappointed, and yet still hungry for something else. Thus, Yelp will pump out more recommendations for users to discover and ponder over, with “fresh” recommendations promised each week.\nCollections is now available via Yelp’s mobile apps for iOS and Android as well as the web.
