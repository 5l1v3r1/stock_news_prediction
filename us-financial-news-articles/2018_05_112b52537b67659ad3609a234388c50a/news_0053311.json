(Nasdaq:AFSI) (the \"Company\" or \"AmTrust\") today announced that leading independent proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. (“Glass Lewis”) has recommended that AmTrust stockholders vote “FOR” the Company’s previously announced merger agreement at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on June 4, 2018. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Evergreen Parent, L.P. will acquire for $13.50 per share in cash the approximately 45% of the Company's shares of common stock that the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and certain of its affiliates and related parties do not already own or control, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.\nIn its May 24, 2018 report, Glass Lewis acknowledged that the value achieved in the going-private transaction represents the highest and most certain value available for public stockholders: 1\n“Given the rigor of these negotiations and the need to offer Stone Point concessions to accept the deal at $13.50 per share, as well as the absence of any increased offer since Icahn's public involvement in the stock, it does not appear likely that the special committee could extract a higher price.”\n“The purchase price falls above or within the valuation ranges derived in the advisor’s comparable companies, precedent transactions and dividend discount analyses. The exit price also represents what is, in our view, an attractive premium to the unaffected trading price of AmTrust shares and falls well above the average closing share price over the one-month and three-month periods trailing announcement of the initial offer.” Regarding the independent and rigorous process that the Special Committee of the AmTrust Board of Directors took in evaluating the going-private proposal, Glass Lewis stated:\n“The Company indicates the special committee was given free range in its negotiations with the Stone Point and the KZ Family and to consider potential alternatives on behalf of unaffiliated shareholders before unanimously approving the proposed transaction agreement. In this case, we believe generally reasonable measures have been taken to safeguard the interests of unaffiliated shareholders in the transaction proceedings. In particular, we note that the proposed transaction agreement includes a \"majority of the minority\" vote requirement, which we believe serves an important role in protecting the interests of minority shareholders in related-party transactions.” The Glass Lewis report also highlights the continued business risk facing the Company and the transfer of these risks to the buyer group as a result of this transaction:\n“As it stands, we do not believe Icahn has proposed a clear or credible plan to achieve the valuation range indicated in its presentation to shareholders and we note that this valuation reflects the long-term view of the Company’s potential without discounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving that potential.”\n“On the other hand, the Special Committee Case Projections also do not capture the potential downside associated with a possible ratings downgrade. We see that the proposed consideration falls well above the fair value range derived in a version of the dividend discount analysis prepared by the advisor for reference purposes only that utilizes a downside case prepared by management that is intended to reflect the negative consequences of a ratings downgrade to the Company’s insurance business ($5.19 to $7.10).”\n1 Permission to use quotations herein neither sought nor obtained\nAmTrust issued the following statement regarding the reports recently issued by proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) and Glass Lewis:\nWe are pleased that Glass Lewis recognizes the significant, certain cash value that will be delivered to AmTrust’s public stockholders as a result of this transaction and that Glass Lewis supports the recommendation from the Board’s independent Special Committee that AmTrust stockholders vote “FOR” the proposed merger. However, we strongly believe that ISS reached the wrong conclusion in failing to recommend that AmTrust stockholders vote “FOR” the proposed merger.\nDespite significant actions taken, the underperformance of AmTrust’s stock shows that the public markets are not accepting of the Company's business risks. The going private transaction eliminates these risks for public stockholders and maximizes the value of their shares. It is the culmination of an independent process overseen by a Special Committee composed solely of independent directors. The Special Committee was assisted by independent financial and legal advisors, which were carefully and promptly selected following interviews with several firms. The Special Committee considered a wide range of alternatives to determine whether greater value to the merger could be achieved and unanimously determined that the merger delivers the highest value to public stockholders. The leverage the Special Committee had in negotiating the transaction was its ability to reject this or any other transaction, not simply open the process as ISS has suggested.\nThe merger provides immediate liquidity at a significant premium to AmTrust’s public stockholders. The $13.50 per share cash offer represents a 33% premium to AmTrust’s unaffected stock price and a 10% increase in value over the buyer group’s initial cash proposal following intense negotiations by the Special Committee. Notably, Evergreen Parent has communicated to the Company that they are not willing to consider any other transaction, and no price increases are available.\nAbsent this transaction, independent industry analysts agree with the Board's assessment that the value of AmTrust's shares is likely to decline and to continue trading at depressed levels given the challenges facing the Company and its majority ownership structure. AmTrust stockholders are faced with a choice: vote for the transaction and the certain, maximum value it provides, or continue to endure the underperformance and business risks that market trends indicate public stockholders do not want.\nThe AmTrust Board believes the choice is clear and continues to unanimously recommend that stockholders follow the Glass Lewis recommendation and vote “FOR” the proposed transaction.\nAs it relates to the establishment of the record date, AmTrust noted the record date was set and announced in accordance with applicable NASDAQ rules and law. The Company conducted a broker search 20 business days before the record date as required by SEC rules, and thus the record date would have been available to market participants through “a simple phone call,” as acknowledged by ISS.\nAmTrust stockholders who have questions or need assistance in\nvoting their shares, please contact AmTrust’s solicitor:\nMacKenzie Partners, Inc.\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor\nNew York, New York 10018\n(212) 929-5500 (Call Collect)\nCall Toll-Free (800) 322-2885\nEmail: Amtrust@mackenziepartners.com\nAbout AmTrust Financial Services, Inc.\nAmTrust Financial Services, Inc., a multinational insurance holding company headquartered in New York, offers specialty property and casualty insurance products, including workers' compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and extended service and warranty coverage through its primary insurance subsidiaries rated \"A\" (Excellent) by A.M.
