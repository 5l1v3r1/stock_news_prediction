That doesn’t bring me anything,” Zerbo said.\nBut verification could be achieved in time for the summit, he added.\n“There’s a lot of things we can do in two weeks. But we cannot do something on the 23rd (of May) to finish and certify on the 23rd,” he said.\nThe Comprehensive nuclear Test-Ban Treaty has been signed by 183 countries and ratified by 166. But to come into effect it must be ratified by eight remaining so-called Annex 2 states, including North Korea and the United States as well as Israel, Iran, India and Pakistan.\nThe CTBTO runs a global network of monitoring stations that use seismic and other technology to detect nuclear explosions like North Korea’s recent tests. That equipment also shows North Korea has yet to blow up the tunnels at Pyunggye-ri, Zerbo said.\n“To date, we haven’t heard any noise that is linked to the blow of a tunnel in the vicinity of the test site,” he said.
