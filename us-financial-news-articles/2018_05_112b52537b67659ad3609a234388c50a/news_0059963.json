Some of those who managed to get into university to study music have struggled to pay the fees, he added.\nThere is a lot of talent in La Carpio, but that is not appreciated by the media or people in other parts of the city, contributing to a significant drop-out rate, said Montero, who runs the organization’s orchestra and chamber group.\n“Part of my challenge is to continue educating the community that they have the same qualities as anyone with money, and they can achieve whatever they set out to do,” he said.\nDriving through La Carpio’s narrow streets lined with concrete-block houses and shops, Fernandez, a communications specialist from San Jose, said she had been shocked by the dismal conditions for some families when the music classes started seven years ago.\n“It was really run-down ... it’s incredible what just a few recorders started to develop,” she said, adding that La Carpio’s dangerous reputation initially made many volunteers nervous.\nNow streets have been paved, many houses have sprouted a second floor, and better policing has helped cut violent crime, said her colleague Aviles, although dealers still peddle drugs, water supplies are erratic and affordable housing hard to find.\nSome mothers who dropped out of education are returning to finish high school, and attitudes to work and family are changing, Aviles added, with fewer people now giving their children fizzy drinks for breakfast.\nSHAKING OFF STIGMA Volunteer Wendy Valverde, playing games with four children in the SIFAIS library, said the community had suffered from stigma and a reputation for crime.\n“But in reality, the children and their families are looking to succeed,” she said.\nThe project will soon receive high-tech gear worth $100,000 to teach computer programing and robotics, largely funded by donations from shoppers at a chain of local home-ware stores.\nBesides broadening horizons for La Carpio’s children, some local women trained at SIFAIS now run a business making and selling handbags and purses from recycled fabrics, each with a tag giving their producers’ story.\nMarisol Quezada, who found a job as a maid when she first arrived in Costa Rica but now runs sewing courses and helps make the accessories, said about half the people in the workshop were migrants from Nicaragua like herself.\n“There are people who are older who can’t get work elsewhere who can find something here,” said Quezada in the noisy workshop amid sewing machines draped with fabric.\nCreating chances for vulnerable communities rather than giving cash handouts reaps longer-term rewards, said Aviles, who wants more funding for scholarships, as well as for other poor neighborhoods to start similar projects.\n“Many gringos (foreigners) come to the community, thinking that giving money solves the problem of poverty,” she added. “Don’t give us money - give people opportunities.”\nReporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Megan Rowling.
