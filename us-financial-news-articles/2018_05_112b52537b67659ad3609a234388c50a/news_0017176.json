IndInfravit Trust (IndInfravit), sponsored by L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited (“L&T IDPL”), will initially acquire five operational toll roads and plans to grow in the future through additional investments in road infrastructure in India.\nCPPIB will invest approximately C$200 million for 30% of IndInfravit units, ACP has acquired 25% of the units and L&T IDPL will hold 15% of the units. The remainder of the units have been subscribed by other local and international institutional investors. L&T IDPL will act as a Sponsor and its subsidiary will act as the Investment Manager for the Trust. IndInfravit will be listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSE”) and BSE Limited (“BSE”).

The rapidly growing Indian economy brings with it a need for sound infrastructure, and we are pleased to be able to support this growth while delivering solid long-term, risk adjusted returns for the CPP Fund.”\nThe five toll roads initially constructed by L&T IDPL are spread across four Indian states of Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan, which together have a total population of 238 million people and contribute around 24% to India’s GDP. These toll roads have been operating for approximately five years now and are used by diverse groups of road users and for goods traffic.\nChristian Fingerle, Chief Investment Officer at ACP, said, “This investment marks a key milestone for us, as it is ACP’s first direct investment in Asia. Infrastructure is a key driver of India’s economy and it is well served by a reliable fiscal and legal policy framework that attracts long-term investors such as ourselves. As such, it fits in with our investment strategy of specializing in core infrastructure assets in attractive markets. We are pleased to have partnered with two renowned and like-minded firms, which already have a strong record of investing in India. We believe that our investment will be an attractive opportunity for our customers and will further support India’s growth.”\nL&T IDPL is a leading developer of infrastructure projects in India with a main focus on the road sector and electricity transmission sectors.
