(NYSE: CIT) today announced the final results of its \"modified Dutch auction\" tender offer, which expired at 11:59 p.m., ET, on May 23, 2018.\nBased on the final count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, CIT accepted for payment 11,123,287 shares of CIT's common stock at a purchase price of $54.75 per share, for a cost of approximately $609 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. Excluding up to $25 million reserved for employee stock ownership plans, this completes our return of capital to stockholders being made pursuant to CIT's amended capital plan. The shares of common stock accepted for purchase include 9,132,420 shares that CIT initially offered to purchase for up to $500 million and 1,990,867 additional shares that CIT has elected to purchase for the remaining balance pursuant to its right to purchase up to an additional 2% of its outstanding shares without amending or extending the tender offer. The repurchased shares represent approximately 8.8% of CIT's common shares issued and outstanding as of May 22, 2018.\nBecause the aggregate purchase price for all shares properly tendered at or below the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date would have exceeded $609 million, such shares were accepted for purchase on a pro rata basis, except for \"odd lots,\" which were accepted in full. CIT has been informed by the depositary that the proration factor for the tender offer, after giving effect to the priority for \"odd lots,\" is approximately 80.1%, which is lower than the proration factor of 86.4% initially reported by the depositary in the preliminary results. The depositary will promptly pay for all shares accepted for payment and will return all other shares tendered.\nCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC acted as the Dealer Manager for the offer. Georgeson LLC acted as the information agent and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. acted as the depositary for the offer.
