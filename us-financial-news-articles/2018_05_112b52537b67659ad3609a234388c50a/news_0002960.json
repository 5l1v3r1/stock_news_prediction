Just 16.5 percent of Malawi’s lawmakers are female.\nFew women have leadership positions within political parties and their formal participation is often limited to support roles, the study found.\nThe unpredictability of the 2014 election meant parties were much less willing to field women candidates - even though the success rate of men and women was roughly equal, it said.\nReporting by Charles Pensulo, Editing by Claire Cozens Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
