Soccer Football - Championship Play-Off Final - Fulham vs Aston Villa - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - May 26, 2018 Fulham's Tom Cairney celebrates promotion to the Premier League Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien\nCairney’s first-half goal was decisive as Fulham, owned by U.S. billionaire Shahid Khan, held on to their narrow lead despite having defender Denis Odoi sent off after 70 minutes as tempers began to fray on a sultry afternoon.\nThe win secures the west London club a windfall of at least 160 million pounds ($212.91 million) as they look forward to joining Championship title winners Wolverhampton Wanderers and second-placed Cardiff City in the top flight next season.\nFulham, who failed to claim automatic promotion when losing to Birmingham City on the final day of the regular season as they finished third in the table, celebrated with their joyous fans as they sealed a lucrative place among the elite.\n“After we missed out on promotion (in the playoffs) last season, a lot of people wrote us off. We got a lot of stick. But football won today. Football was the winner,” Cairney said.\nWith the stakes so high it was no surprise that the match was a frenetic affair in the opening stages.

VILLA RESPOND\nVilla, led by former England and Chelsea defender John Terry, were dreadful in the first half but they revived after the break.
