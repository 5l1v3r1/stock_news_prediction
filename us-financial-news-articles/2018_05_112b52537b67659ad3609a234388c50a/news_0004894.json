The yield gap between U.S. 5-year notes and U.S. 30-year bonds narrowed to 27.20 basis points, the lowest spread in more than six years. The other benchmark measure, the spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year notes, was also flatter at 45.60 basis points , the narrowest in two weeks. Aaron Kohli, director of rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said U.S. data on Monday morning had been mediocre, supporting the Treasury market's curve flattening trend. There are also technical factors involved, he added. \"The varying technicals in the curve highlight the Federal Reserve's increasing control of the front-end and belly (5- and 7-year notes) and the extent to which the longer dated yields (10s and 30s) have thus far resisted following the same pattern,\" Kohli said. \"We're likely to keep with the longer-term flattening view in 2s/10s and 5s/30s till we see this technical divergence correct.\" Data showed U.S. personal income rose just 0.3 percent in March, compared with expectations of 0.4 percent. This was also revised lower in February to a rise of 0.3 percent, instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent increase. The U.S. Midwest manufacturing index also came in slightly lower than expected, with a reading of 57.6, while U.S. pending home sales, while posting an increase, fell short of a forecast for a 1.0 percent gain. That said, Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies in New York, noted that he was not too worried about the slight miss in expectations for Monday's data. \"I don't think those would alter the Fed's thinking on rates,\" Simons said. \"We all know that inflation is still trending on the positive side.\" In late morning trading, U.S. 10-year yields slipped to 2.949 percent from 2.957 percent late on Friday. U.S. 30-year yields also dipped to 3.108 percent from Friday's 3.125 percent. U.S. two-year note yields, meanwhile, were slightly higher at 2.492 percent from 2.484 percent on Friday.
