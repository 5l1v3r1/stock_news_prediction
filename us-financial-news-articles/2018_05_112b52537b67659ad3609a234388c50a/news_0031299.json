In the first quarter, investments in construction were one of the biggest drivers of a gross domestic product expansion of 0.3 percent, data showed on Tuesday.\nIn housing construction, nominal sales jumped 27 percent on the year in January and February, HDB said, adding that strong order books were pointing to a continuation of the boom.\nThe overhang of pending residential building permits increased to more than 400,000, the body said, suggesting that the sector will continue to drive growth in the coming months.
