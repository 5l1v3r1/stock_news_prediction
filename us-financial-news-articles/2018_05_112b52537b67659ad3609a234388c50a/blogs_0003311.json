Hussain misled the market, the company said.\n“That Mr. Hussain attempted to depict the fraud as nothing more than a misunderstanding of international accounting rules was, and still remains, patently ridiculous,” the company said.\nHPE last year completed the spin-off of much of its software business, closing the door on the Autonomy deal. HPE was formed when the company once known as Hewlett-Packard split into HPE and HP Inc in November 2015.\nReporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T00:16:30.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
