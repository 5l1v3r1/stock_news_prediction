The companies announced Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had given it the all-clear.\nThe new treatment, which can be administered with an autoinjector, should now be available within a week. The companies say Aimovig significantly reduces monthly migraine days.\nAmgen’s stock rose 1.2% on the news, while Switzerland’s Novartis was up 0.3% at the time of writing. However, Amgen’s stock had fallen by 2.1% earlier this week, after Eli Lilly (lly) reported good results in tests of an Amgen-competing headache drug and Pfizer (pfe) won approval for its version of Amgen’s Epogen/Procrit, a treatment for anemia.\n“Migraine is a serious and misunderstood disease with significant gaps in the way it is both perceived and treated,” said Novartis president Fabrice Chouraqui in an announcement about the FDA’s approval of Aimovig.\nAround 10 million Americans are thought to suffer frequent migraines, which can cause everything from severe headaches to nausea and light and sound sensitivity.
