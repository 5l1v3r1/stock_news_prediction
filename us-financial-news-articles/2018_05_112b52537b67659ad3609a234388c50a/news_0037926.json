(Nasdaq:ALBO), a clinical-stage orphan pediatric liver disease company developing novel bile acid modulators, today provided corporate highlights for the beginning of 2018.\n“The beginning of 2018 has been a landmark period for Albireo,” said Ron Cooper, President and Chief Executive Officer of Albireo. “We achieved a major milestone with enrollment of the first patient in PEDFIC-1, our Phase 3 clinical trial with A4250, an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor, in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). In January, we announced that our licensee received regulatory approval in Japan for the world’s first approved IBAT inhibitor, elobixibat, for the treatment of chronic constipation. This is strong validation of our scientific platform, and it triggered over $55 million in payments to Albireo. In addition, we raised over $94 million in net proceeds from equity financings.”\nRecent Highlights\nA4250\nEnrolled first patient in the PEDFIC-1 study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of A4250 in patients with PFIC (subtype 1 or 2). The Phase 3 program includes a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate A4250 in approximately 60 patients, ages 6 months to 18 years, with elevated serum bile acid (sBA) levels and pruritus, and an open-label extension study to assess long-term safety and durability of response. Initiation of the study followed extensive dialogue with regulatory authorities in the US and EU. Additional trial sites are being activated around the world to generate data in support of potential drug approval applications for A4250 in the US and EU. A4250 has received orphan drug designation for PFIC in the US and EU, and has been granted access to the EMA’s PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) program for the treatment of PFIC.\nPresented positive data on a pruritus pharmacodynamic marker measured in the completed Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in children with cholestatic liver disease and pruritus at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) The International Liver Congress™ in April 2018 in a poster, titled “Correlation of autotaxin levels, serum bile acids, and pruritus in a multiple-dose, open-label, multinational study of the ileal bile acid transport inhibitor A4250.”\nElobixibat\nElobixibat became the first IBAT inhibitor approved anywhere in the world. Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved a new drug application for elobixibat for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan in January 2018. This triggered a milestone payment from EA Pharma Co., Ltd. of over $10 million.\nAlbireo subsidiary Elobix AB entered into an agreement to monetize its royalty rights under its license agreement with EA Pharma for elobixibat in the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan with HealthCare Royalty Partners in January 2018. Elobix received a $45 million payment from HealthCare Royalty Partners, with the potential for an additional $15 million.\nCorporate\nRaised $94.1 million in net proceeds from equity financings.\nPresented at multiple investor conferences, including the Cowen and Company Health Care Conference, Roth Healthcare Conference, Needham & Company Healthcare Conference and the H.C. Wainwright Global Life Sciences Conference.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Albireo will host a conference call and webcast today, May 17, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

Actual results, performance or experience may differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement as a result of various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to: whether favorable findings from clinical trials of A4250 to date, including findings in indications other than PFIC, will be predictive of results from the trials comprising the Phase 3 PFIC program or any other clinical trials of A4250; whether either or both of the FDA and EMA will determine that the primary endpoint for their respective evaluations and treatment duration of the double blind Phase 3 trial in patients with PFIC are sufficient, even if the primary endpoint is met with statistical significance, to support approval of A4250 in the United States or the European Union, to treat PFIC, a symptom of PFIC, a specific PFIC subtype(s) or otherwise; the outcome and interpretation by regulatory authorities of the ongoing third-party study pooling and analyzing long-term PFIC patient data; the timing for initiation or completion of, or for availability of data from, clinical trials of A4250, including the trials comprising the Phase 3 PFIC program, and the outcomes of such trials; delays or other challenges in the recruitment of patients for, or the conduct of, the double blind Phase 3 trial; the significant control that EA Pharma has over the commercialization of elobixibat in Japan; and Albireo’s critical accounting policies.
