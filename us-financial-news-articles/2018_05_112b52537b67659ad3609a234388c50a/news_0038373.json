The game was a makeup from a postponement on April 8.\nSeattle was playing its first game without star second baseman Robinson Cano, who broke his right hand in Sunday’s game against the Detroit Tigers. Cano was officially placed on the 10-day disabled list on Monday and is expected to miss six to eight weeks.\nMariners left-hander Wade LeBlanc tossed six scoreless frames. LeBlanc gave up three hits, struck out four and didn’t issue a walk.\nLefty reliever James Pazos (1-0) got the victory after working out of a seventh-inning jam by stranding a runner at third.\nMitch Garver laced a one-out double to center and moved to third on Morrison’s groundout before Pazos retired Eddie Rosario on a popup to second.\nMinnesota right-hander Jake Odorizzi allowed four hits over six shutout innings. He struck out seven and walked one.\nSeattle had runners on first and second in the sixth inning when Kyle Seager lined a bullet up the middle. But the ball caromed off Odorizzi’s backside over to shortstop Ehire Adrianza, who stepped on second for a forceout.\nOdorizzi then struck out Ryon Healy on his 97th and final pitch of the night to end the threat.\nThe Mariners were 1 for 13 with runners in scoring position. Minnesota was 0 for 2.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
