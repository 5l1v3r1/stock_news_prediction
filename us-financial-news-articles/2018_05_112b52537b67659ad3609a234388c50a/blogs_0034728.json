The White House did not immediately provide comment on North Korea's sudden change of plans.\nJust hours earlier, South Korea's Unification Ministry had announced that North Korea had proposed the inter-Korea talks that would have been held Wednesday. The meeting would have included discussions about ending the seven-decade-long Korean war and upholding the pledge to completely denuclearize the peninsula, according to the Unification Ministry.\nNorth Korea said it would destroy its only known nuclear test site between May 23 and 25, weather permitting. The regime has not, however, promised to get rid of its nuclear arsenal .\nThe Pentagon said in March that the U.S. and South Korea's April 1 joint military drills would be conducted on a similar scale to previous years, despite the warming relations with the north. The exercises usually provoke an angry response from North Korea .\nNorth Korea's current threats come in response to the so-called Max Thunder military exercises. The two-week air forces drills, which began on Friday, comprise roughly 100 warplanes, including eight F-22 radar-evading fighters and a number of B-52 bombers and F-15K jets, Yonhap reported.\nThis is a developing story.
