None of the global payment card companies, however, operate in the Chinese domestic market yet.\nCountries such as Russia and Indonesia also have an onshore data storage requirement, but they do not restrict companies from transfer of transactions data offshore as well, according to lobby group U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), which counts the three U.S. card companies among its members.\nGlobal payment firms currently store and process Indian transactions outside the country and a major concern to the industry is a clause in the RBI’s order that asks for data to be stored “only in India”, two sources said.\nThat, according to the industry, would restrict the transfer of data needed to effectively detect and analyze global fraud patterns, and make India more vulnerable to financial crime.\nIn a letter dated May 3, seen by Reuters, the USIBC pressed the RBI for a “reversal or an indefinite stay” of its directive, which it said would make India’s payments ecosystem more prone to cyber-attacks.\nIt also urged the RBI to remove any restriction on transferring the data outside India and specify the time period for which the data needed to be stored locally.\nAn industry executive at a U.S. payments firm said while the RBI was likely to soon issue clarifications to address some of their concerns, but it would not change the notification’s implementation date.\nIn an earnings call last month, Visa CEO Alfred Kelly Jr. referred to the RBI’s six-month deadline as a “tough timeframe”.\nThe directive comes as more people in India are switching to plastic money, partly driven by the Modi’s decision to replace high-value currency notes in November 2016, since when the government has aggressively discouraged cash transactions.\nIn March, Indians clocked transactions worth $52 billion using their 900 million credit and debit cards, nearly double the amount recorded in November 2016, data from the RBI showed.\nBut fraud is a concern too. The RBI recorded 57,411 cases of card fraud totaling $43 million in the three years to December 2017, according to a Right to Information response seen by Reuters.\nThe RBI in April said the payment ecosystem in India had “expanded considerably”, making it necessary to ensure “the safety and security” of data.\nReporting by Aditi Shah and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi, Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:31:08.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
