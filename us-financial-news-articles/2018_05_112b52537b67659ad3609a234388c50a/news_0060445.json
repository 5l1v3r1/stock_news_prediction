REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen\nDeutsche Post developed the Streetscooter for internal use to keep emissions low as online shopping results in more demand for parcel deliveries, but demand from other companies for the van has pushed it to boost production.\nThe new production site in Dueren, north western Germany, will be able to produce around 10,000 per year and joins another factory in Aachen.\nDeutsche Post currently uses over 6,000 Streetscooter vans itself.\nOn Monday, it won a contract to deliver 200 electric trucks to a British company that delivers bottles of milk to homes.
