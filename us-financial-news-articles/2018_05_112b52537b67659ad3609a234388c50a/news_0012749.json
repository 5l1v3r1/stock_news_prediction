At 76 years, Roger has had a long and illustrious career in the mining and exploration business, having contributed to the discovery of numerous metal deposits, including the Avocado and Iceberg gold deposits of NuLegacy Gold, the nearby 20+ million ounce Pipeline gold deposit of Barrick Gold, the 2 million ounce Long Valley gold deposit as well as several molybdenum, copper and tungsten deposits\nDr. Steininger leaves NuLegacy well-staffed with one of the best Carlin-style exploration teams in Nevada, having helped, amongst other recruitments, in the enrollment of Mr. Ed Cope, recently retired VP of North American exploration for Barrick Gold as a NuLegacy Director. Mr. Cope in turn was instrumental in the recruitment of former Barrick personnel Ms. Denise Dowell (as NUG’s Geotechnical Modelling Administrator), William Mounts (Drilling Supervisor) and most recently Mr. Charles Weakly, one of Barrick Gold’s top geologists and ‘gold finders’ as NuLegacy’s District Geologist. Mr. Weakley, together with NuLegacy’s Chief Geologist Derick Unger, are taking over responsibility for drill targeting.\n“On behalf of all of us I want to thank Roger for his genuine partnership in building NuLegacy”, said Albert Matter, NuLegacy’s Chairman, “during the process of which he has taught us all a great deal about these highly coveted and elusive elephant-sized Carlin-style gold deposits, while becoming a dear friend. We look forward to his continued sound input as a director”.\nDr. Steininger is both a member of the Dean’s Council and Chair of the Geoscience Advisory Council of the Warner College of Natural Resources, Colorado State University. With an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of mining in the state of Nevada, Dr. Steininger intends to devote a good deal of his time to writing some of that history for posterity, as well as traveling with his wife of 51 years LuAnne, and spending more time with his family, all who live in Reno.\nAbout NuLegacy Gold Corporation : NuLegacy is a Nevada exploration company focused on discovering additional Carlin-style gold deposits on its premier district scale 98 sq. km (38 sq. mile) Red Hill Project in the prolific Cortez gold trend of Nevada.\nTo date NuLegacy has discovered the Iceberg Carlin-style gold deposits and has identified several more highly prospective exploration targets that are being drilled this year.\nNuLegacy’s Red Hill Project is located on trend and adjacent i to the three multi-million ounce Carlin-type gold deposits (the Pipeline, Cortez Hills and Goldrush deposits) that are amongst Barrick Gold’s largest, lowest cost and politically safest gold mines ii .\ni The similarity and proximity of these deposits in the Cortez Trend is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in NuLegacy’s Red Hill Project.\nii As extracted from Barrick’s Q4-2013 and Q1-2014 reports. As reported by Barrick, the Goldrush resource contains 8,557,000 indicated ounces of gold within 25.78 million tonnes grading ~10.57 g/t and 1,650,000 inferred ounces within 5.6 million tonnes grading ~9.0 g/t.\nOn Behalf Of NuLegacy Gold Corporation\nJames E Anderson, Chief Executive Officer\nFor further information, please phone 604-639-3640 or contact James Anderson (CEO) at james@nuggold.com , Albert Matter (Chairman) at albert@nuggold.com or Roger Steininger, (CGO) at roger@nuggold.com , or Frank Lagiglia (ICM) at frank@nuggold.com or visit www.nulegacygold.com .\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or future performance and reflect management’s current expectations and assumptions.
