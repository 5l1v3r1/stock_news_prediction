It will be their second appearance following 2011 in New Zealand when they lost all four pool games.\nGermany, who have never been in a World Cup, now have another chance as they are promoted to face Portugal in a playoff, though the winners face a daunting final step with a two-legged playoff against Samoa.\nThe winner on aggregate will qualify for Japan 2019 in Pool A, alongside the hosts, Ireland, Scotland and Russia. The loser will still have a chance of progress via the Repechage competition in November.\nTuesday’s announcement is the latest twist to a complicated and controversial series of matches as, following an investigation by the independent Judicial and Disputes committee, the three nations were docked five match points for each ineligible player used.\nBelgium were found to have fielded five ineligible players and were docked 30 points along with a suspended fine of 125,000 pounds ($168,988).\nSpain used Mathieu Belie and Bastien Fuster, who have both previously played for France Under-20s, in eight qualification matches, leading to a 40-point deduction and a 50,000 pounds suspended fine.\nRomania had only one ineligible player, Sione Faka’osilea, who previously played for Tonga Sevens. They were given a 100,000 pounds suspended fine and their 30 docked points overturned their World Cup qualification.\nAll the decisions are subject to appeal within 14 days and Tuesday’s announcement is unlikely to be the final word. REJECTED APPEAL\nSpain’s initial appeal to replay their match against Belgium, when a Romanian referee was in charge and Spain’s shock defeat sent Romania through at their expense, was rejected, despite the sport’s governing body supporting it.\n“Having considered all the evidence, including submissions from World Rugby, Rugby Europe, Spain and Belgium, the independent committee refused the request made by World Rugby and Spain to set aside the result of the match and determined that the match should not be replayed,” the committee\nIn reference to the entire investigation, the committee added: “Although mistakes were made by Rugby Europe and participating unions, they had not acted in bad faith. The committee also recommended that World Rugby re-emphasise the importance and sanctity of Regulation 8 (eligibility) and any other steps that will prevent a repeat of these circumstances.”\nThe Spanish Rugby Federation said they were very disappointed by the decisions, having sought clearance for Belie and Fuster from their French counterparts, and were considering an appeal.\n“It should be recognised that the (eligibility) rule is confusing and World Rugby should have created a procedure and created a system to avoid these type of undesirable situations from happening,” the federation\nEligibility for international rugby is a notoriously complicated affair, with countries often nominating their own choice of “capture” level team that ensures a player cannot then switch nationalities.\nRecognising this, the independent committee added in its report: “World Rugby might want to consider whether to maintain a database showing players who have been captured by Unions.” Reporting by Mitch Phillips, additional reporting by Richard Martin editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:09:24.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
