Even so, last week, California and 16 other states sued to challenge the Trump administration’s decision to revise U.S. vehicle rules.\nAuto industry executives have held meetings with the Trump administration for months and have urged the administration to try to reach a deal with California even as they support slowing the pace of reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that the Obama administration rules outlined.\nOne automaker official said part of the message to President Donald Trump at a meeting on Friday will be to consider California like a foreign trade deal that needs to be renegotiated. Automakers want to urge him to get automakers a “better deal” – as opposed to potentially years of litigation between major states and federal regulators.\nOn Friday, Trump is set to meet with the chief executives of General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the top U.S. executives of at least five other major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ) and Daimler AG, to talk about revisions to the vehicle rules. Senior EPA and Transportation Department officials will also attend.\nEnvironmental groups are eager to keep the rules in place, saying they will save consumers billions in fuel costs. A coalition of groups plans to stage a protest outside Ford’s headquarters in Michigan.\nThe Obama administration’s rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.\nHeidi King, the Trump administration’s nominee to head NHTSA, which oversees Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, is set to have a confirmation hearing on May 16 before the Senate Commerce Committee.
