A rise above 3.035 scaled on April 25 would take it to its highest since early 2014.\nTrump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.\nThe euro lost 0.15 percent to $1.1847 after sliding as low as $1.1838 overnight, its weakest since Dec. 22.\nThe euro, already under pressure from weak economic indicators and widening U.S.-euro zone interest rate differentials, was also hit by political developments in Italy.\nSentiment towards the euro cooled after Italian President Sergio Mattarella’s call to bickering political parties to rally behind a “neutral government” were met with immediate opposition and raised the prospect of elections being held as early as July.\n“The dollar is in a firm position to gain against its European peers as rhetoric from central banks such as the ECB and the Band of England is perceived to have turned dovish,” said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\nThe euro was 0.25 percent higher at 129.800 yen after plumbing a six-week low of 129.240 on Tuesday. It was on track to end a seven-day losing run.\nSterling traded at $1.3542 following a decline to a four-month low of $1.3485 overnight.\nThe pound has fallen heavily in recent weeks on expectations the BoE would not, as earlier believed, tighten monetary policy because of a relatively weak economy and as investors piled into a rallying dollar.\nThe Australian dollar extended its overnight slide to touch an 11-month low of $0.7428.\nPressured by the dollar’s broad strength, the Aussie has slid despite an upbeat budget from the country’s government.
