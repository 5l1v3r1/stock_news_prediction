And you definitely can’t do it if you’re the CEO of a major public company.”\nSamsonite’s Ramesh Tainwala speaks during an interview in Hong Kong in March last year. Photo: Calvin Sit/Bloomberg News Mr. Aandahl’s presentation followed a 48-page report he published last week that also critiqued some of Samsonite’s accounting practices and corporate governance.\nThe “Dr.” designation appeared alongside Mr. Tainwala’s name in at least two regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission more than a decade ago, as well as in some regulatory documents in India. It was also included in press reports and Mr. Tainwala was addressed as “Dr.” on at least one earnings call. Mr. Aandahl said he found at least 73 biographical references that labeled Mr. Tainwala as a doctor.\nThe problem is Mr. Tainwala never earned a doctoral degree, a fact he later confirmed in an email to The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Tainwala told the Journal last week after Blue Orca’s report was published that he “never claimed” to hold a doctoral degree. He said he had enrolled for a Ph.D. program in 1992, and friends and colleagues jokingly addressed him as “doctor” afterward even though he didn’t complete the program.\nSamsonite didn’t have an immediate comment to Mr. Aandahl’s speech. Samsonite’s shares remained halted Wednesday for a third straight day. In a Monday filing, the company said it halted its shares “pending the release of a further announcement in relation to certain allegations contained in a report.”\nThe stock fell a combined 21% on Thursday and Friday last week after Blue Orca published its report. It was Samsonite’s biggest two-day drop since it went public in Hong Kong in 2011.\nHours after Mr. Tainwala’s disclosure to the Journal last week, Samsonite published a statement saying Blue Orca’s report was “one-sided and misleading, and the conclusions drawn in the report are incorrect.” Samsonite’s chairman, Timothy Parker, was Quote: d as saying he had “full confidence in Ramesh’s capabilities as CEO, and in the broader management team.”\nBut Mr. Aandahl said he is even more confident now that Mr. Tainwala should be fired following his disclosure to the Journal. “Restoring Samsonite’s credibility in the market simply requires that he goes.”\nMr. Aandahl was one of several investment managers who spoke at Wednesday’s conference, where each presenter was given a short time slot to explain their latest big investing idea. Seth Fischer of Oasis Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund, touted Japan Asset Marketing Co. , claiming it has 50% upside from current levels. He recommended Sony Corp. at last year’s Sohn conference and the stock has risen about 25% since then.\nCarl Huttenlocher of Myriad Asset Management said he was bullish on mainland Chinese stocks ahead of MSCI ’s upcoming inclusion of A-shares in its indexes Friday. That reversed a bearish call he made on China at this conference four years ago.\nWrite to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-12420?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12420?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12420?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12420?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12420?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12420?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-05-30T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:19:55.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
