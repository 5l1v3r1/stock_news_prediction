There is no rush, there is no pressure on the company (to sell shares).”\nHe also said that he favours a London listing and believes that it is the most obvious addition to the local listing.\nPolyus has not been targeted by the U.S. sanctions. However, Washington included Suleiman Kerimov along with some other Russian businessmen on the SDN list in April. Said Kerimov, who is the son of Suleiman Kerimov, controls the company.\n“The company is not under sanctions,” Grachev said. However “it doesn’t rule out the emotional effect which these events had on the Russian market and the company in general.”\n“We do not see any other remedy except time which will bring clarity,” he said, adding Polyus was in contact with investors.\nIt had taken some suppliers, customers and bankers several days or weeks to conduct additional due-diligence on Polyus after Suleiman Kerimov was hit with sanctions, he said.\nBut the process had gone well and U.S. investment bank JP Morgan had led its convertible bond buyback in April.
