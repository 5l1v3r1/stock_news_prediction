That didn't work previously, so it was really annoying to switch to an iPad only to see old conversations still floating around.\nFinally, you can save a lot of local storage -- holding on to lots of iMessages can quickly add up to several gigabytes of data. Storing it in iCloud frees all of that up.\nThe new feature is really convenient, so I'll show you how to set it up.\nUpdate your iPhone to iOS 11.4 Open Settings. Tap \"General.\" Tap \"Software Update.\" Check for the update and install it if you haven't yet. Turn on Messages in iCloud Open Settings on your iPhone. Tap your name at the very top of the page. Select \"iCloud.\" Toggle the button for \"Messages\" so that it turns green, which means it's active. Do this on your iPad or other iPhones. It'll look like this when it's turned on:\nTodd Haselton | CNBC Turn the Messages option in iCloud Settings on. That's all you need to do. Now everything will remain in sync across all of your iOS devices, and you'll have a backup of all of your messages in case you lose your phone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T22:40:42.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
