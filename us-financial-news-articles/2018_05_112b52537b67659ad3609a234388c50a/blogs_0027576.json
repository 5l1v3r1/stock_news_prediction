Many economists and analysts argue they will likely add an additional quarter-point increase this year as the impact of burgeoning federal deficits and a recent tax cut are felt in an economy with low unemployment and inflation edging up towards the Fed's two percent target.\nBullard, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy committee this year, said he felt they may be moving too fast. While inflation now appears close to 2 percent, Bullard said his estimate of market-based inflation expectations show that investors \"believe there is currently little inflationary pressure in the U.S.\"\nLeaving rates steady, he said, would \"re-center inflation expectations at the target.\"\nHe laid out a similar case for giving businesses more time to invest, and for extending what he sees as a healthy balance in job markets where building wage pressures offer companies a choice between paying more to workers or investing more capital to raise productivity.\n\"This is an equilibrium process, not an inflationary one,\" Bullard said, and \"it is not necessary to disrupt\" it with higher interest rates.\nHe also flagged an evolving debate at the Fed about how much further rates can rise before they are neutral and no longer \"accommodative.\" That is a sensitive line the central bank may be hesitant to cross, but to Bullard it has already arrived.\nThe Fed's current policy rate of between 1.5 and 1.75 percent is already \"pressing against\" estimates of the neutral rate, he said, another argument against going further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:47:39.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
