He left the game down 4-3 but the St. Louis relief corps surrendered four runs as well.\nManny Pina’s single in the bottom of the second drove home Ryan Braun and handed the Brewers a 1-0 lead. Christian Yelich’s solo home run, his sixth, over the center field fence in the third expanded Milwaukee’s advantage to 2-0.\nSuter’s double of off the glove of St. Louis first baseman Jose Martinez in the fourth plated Braun and Villar and staked the Brewers to a 4-0 lead.\nThe Cardinals responded in the fifth as Yairo Munoz’s two-run home run, the rookie’s first career homer, allowed Harrison Bader to score in front of him and cut Milwaukee’s lead to 4-2. Two outs later, Matt Carpenter ripped a solo round-tripper, his sixth, over the right field fence that brought St. Louis back to within one run.\nBraun singled home Yelich in the bottom of the frame off reliever Mike Mayers. Then the Brewers put away the game in the seventh with Villar’s home run over the center field fence off the Cardinals’ Brett Cecil, driving in Yelich and Braun in the process to push Milwaukee’s lead to 8-3.\nTuesday’s game will be a matchup of right-hander Michael Wacha (5-1, 2.88 ERA) for the Cardinals versus right-hander Zach Davies (2-4, 4.74) for Milwaukee.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:24:38.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
