Dr Marshall joins Galecto with more than 15 years of experience across drug discovery, clinical development and business development in various positions at Glaxo Smithkline (GSK). Most recently, he was Vice-President and Head of the Fibrosis & Lung Injury Discovery Performance Unit. During his tenure at GSK, Dr Marshall led the early clinical development for Nucala TM , anti-IL-5 mAb in asthma and nasal polyposis. He is a visiting Professor at Newcastle University and an Honorary Consultant in Thoracic Medicine at Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust.

This exciting mechanism has the potential to bring new medicines to patients, treating fibrosis and inflammation across a range of severe, often life threatening, diseases. I look forward to working with the superb team at Galecto to help steer the next stage of clinical development for Galecto’s portfolio of candidate drugs,” said Dr Marshall.\nAbout Galectin-3\nGalectin-3 is a member of the galectin family of galactoside binding lectins. Galectin-3 exists both intra- and extracellularly and binds to glycosylated proteins. Galectin-3 has been shown to play a central role in fibrosis development and progression. The activation of macrophages, and recruitment and activation of myofibroblasts, the two central cell types in organ fibrosis, is dependent on galectin-3. Abolition of galectin-3 expression in knockout animals or pharmacological blockade using Galecto Biotech’s inhibitors leads to a dramatic reduction or even prevention of fibrosis.\nAbout Galecto Biotech\nGalecto is focused on developing novel drugs for the treatment of fibrosis, inflammation, and other serious human diseases. The company’s products target galectins or galactoside binding lectins, which are a group of proteins shown to be involved in many disease processes. Since its founding in 2011, Galecto’s team of scientists and experts has proven that galectin-3 is an attractive drug target and that galectin-3 inhibitors are effective in reducing fibrosis in several different organs in preclinical models. Based on this research, Galecto’s high potency galectin modulators may open new treatment possibilities for many patients. The company is located in Copenhagen, Denmark.
