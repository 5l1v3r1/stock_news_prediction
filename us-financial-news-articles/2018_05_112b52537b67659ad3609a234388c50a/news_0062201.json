Consumer advocates had said the move would leave investigators hamstrung as they tried to root out cases of possible wrongdoing.\nCFPB officials have typically relied on consumer data to help investigate and build cases.\nMulvaney said he had been concerned that consumer data could be stolen if the CFPB were hacked. But in tests of CFPB computer systems, Mulvaney said, the agency was able to reliably protect consumer data.\n“This process has been an important exercise in holding ourselves to the same high standards to which we hold the entities we oversee,” Mulvaney wrote to staff in an email.\nThe CFPB was conceived in 2010 to protect consumers from exploitative loans. In November, Mulvaney was tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the agency on an interim basis.\nAs a Republican congressman, Mulvaney said the CFPB was unnecessary and put a crimp in lending markets. As head of the agency, Mulvaney has dropped investigations into several high-cost lenders and said the agency should ease the burden on industry.
