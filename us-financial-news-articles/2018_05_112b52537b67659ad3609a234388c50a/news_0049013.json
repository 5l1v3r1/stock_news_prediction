Odebrecht is currently negotiating with a variety of state authorities, including with officials in Sao Paulo, the country’s largest state by population.\nNeither Odebrecht nor the CGU immediately replied to a request for comment on Monday.\n($1 = 3.68 reais)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T15:34:37.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
