JSE data already shows foreigners sold 1.8 billion rand in stocks last week after offloading nearly 11 billion rand the week before.\n“We still haven’t seen any real results of an improving economy. So (when) we see solid GDP numbers then we could see more international buyers stepping in,” Nedbank Private Wealth Portfolio Manager Grant Gilbert said.\nFirst-quarter GDP numbers are due for release on June 5.\nGilbert said contagion from political and economic crises in other emerging markets could also impact inflows going forward.\n“Given the Italian crisis and the strengthening of the dollar, emerging markets will come under significant pressure and we are already seeing that this week,” he said.\nItaly’s political crisis and rekindled fears of a trade war between Beijing and Washington knocked emerging stocks to a 5-1/2 month low on Wednesday.\nOther analysts said the so-called “Ramaphoria”, in reference to improved sentiment on Ramaphosa’s election, was not enough on its own to lure more investors.\n“One gets the feeling on the ground as a broker that perhaps foreign investors aren’t as enthusiastic about South Africa,” said Cratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies.\n“Ramaphoria - as the media have got - seems to have waned and people are just reading us as another emerging market which is slightly out of favour.” $1 = 12.5478 rand Additional reporting by Patricia Aruo Editing by James Macharia and Toby Chopra", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T10:41:41.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
