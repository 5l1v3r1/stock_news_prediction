A source at Prime Minister May’s office dismissed the report on Thursday.\nWhile indexes were relatively subdued, there were some big movers among individual stocks. Shares in online supermarket Ocado surged nearly 40 percent to an all-time high after the company signed a deal with U.S. retailer Kroger Co to use Ocado’s technology for grocery deliveries in the world’s biggest market.\nEarnings updates also spurred sizeable moves. Altice jumped more than 10 percent after its French unit showed the first signs of recovery in the first quarter, while French waste and water group Suez rose 3.4 percent after higher waste volumes boosted its first-quarter core earnings.\nShares in Maersk, broadcaster RTL and Royal Mail all fell between 3.9 and 9.5 percent after giving updates.\nShares in British bookmakers also came under pressure after the UK government cut the top stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to two pounds. William Hill, GVC and Paddy Power Betfair fell between 0.7 and 3.1 percent.\nReporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:54:15.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
