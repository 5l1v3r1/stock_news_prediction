Bilateral relations continue.”\nIn January, during a ceremony in which the government of Sweden donated funds to CICIG, Kompass made mention of “a corrupt society,” but added that he did “not think it was correct” to say that all of the culture was bad. He also noted that CICIG represented “a strong medicine” for Guatemala.\nIn its earlier statement, the foreign ministry said it would wait for the governments of Sweden and Venezuela to present new ambassadors.\nKompass, formerly the director of field operations for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, made headlines in 2016 when he revealed that the United Nations had been guilty of covering up dozens of cases of sexual abuse against women and children by its global workforce.\nMorales, a former television comedian, became embroiled in a dispute with the United Nations this year when the CICIG tried to impeach him.\nAlthough Morales avoided impeachment, he failed in an attempt to expel the head of CICIG after criticism from the United Nations, the United States and the European Union.\nReporting by Sofia Menchu; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:09:58.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
