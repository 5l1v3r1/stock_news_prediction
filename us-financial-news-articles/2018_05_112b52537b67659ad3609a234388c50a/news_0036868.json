(“Golden Leaf” or the “Company”) (CSE:GLH) (OTCQB:GLDFF), a leading cannabis oil solutions company built around recognized brands, today announced that it has signed a letter of intent (the “LOI”) to acquire two large cannabis cultivation facilities and their associated cultivation licenses, one in Northern Nevada and another in Northern California, that are owned by the same operators. The Nevada facility is currently operational and generating positive cash flow, and the California facility is provisionally licensed for cultivation.\nUnder the terms of the LOI, Golden Leaf would pay US$8.5 million in cash at closing, plus an as of yet undetermined number of shares that equals 25% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of GLH on the closing date.\n“Signing this LOI provides Golden Leaf with an opportunity to secure an agreement that would significantly expand our cultivation capabilities in the high-growth Nevada and California markets, both of which have commenced adult-use sales within the past 12 months,” commented William Simpson, CEO of Golden Leaf. “This opportunity to acquire an established enterprise, with strong brand recognition and positive cash flow generation is consistent with our strategy to build a vertically integrated operation spanning cultivation, processing and retail-driven sales, and to utilize accretive acquisitions to enable Golden Leaf to harvest highly-desirable boutique strains as a key component of a multi-prong growth strategy that can be applied across multiple jurisdictions.”\nCompletion of these acquisitions is subject to numerous conditions, including completion of due diligence, negotiation and execution of defitive agreements, and receipt of any necessary approvals.\nTo be added to the distribution list please email GLH@kcsa.com with “GLH” in the subject line.\nAbout Golden Leaf Holdings\nGolden Leaf Holdings Ltd., a Canadian company with operations in multiple jurisdictions including Oregon, Nevada and Canada, is one of the largest cannabis oil and solution providers in North America, and a leading cannabis products company built around recognized brands.
