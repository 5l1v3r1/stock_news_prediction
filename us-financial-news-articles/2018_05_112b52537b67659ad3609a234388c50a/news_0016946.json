Republicans lawmakers invoked the Congressional Review Act (CRA), an obscure procedure that allows Congress to scrap regulations within 60 working days after they are imposed. The Government Accountability Office agreed last year that the CFPB guidance was being enforced as a rule and that it could be reversed under the review law.\nThe resolution now goes to President Donald Trump for signing.\nThe National Automobile Dealers Association opposed the CFPB measure, saying it limited dealers’ flexibility to use discounted auto loans to help close sales. “Today’s action furthers the bipartisan effort ... to preserve the ability of local dealerships to offer discounted auto loans to their customers,” said Peter Welch, president of the dealers’ group.\nTuesday’s vote challenged the CFPB’s authority to impose rules.\n“Overturning the auto lending guidance just opened the door to uncertainty across federal agencies that use rules and guidance to protect the public from financial predators,” said Rebecca Borné, an attorney with the Center for Responsible Lending.\n“The CRA ... allows politicians to quickly dismiss agency protections that were thoughtfully crafted, often based on years of research and stakeholder input,” she said.\nReporting by Katanga Johnson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T03:47:44.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
