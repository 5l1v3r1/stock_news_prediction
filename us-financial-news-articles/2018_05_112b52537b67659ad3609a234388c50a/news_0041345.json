Results should start flowing on Friday.\nNkurunziza is a former rebel leader who took power in 2005 at the end of a civil war in which around 300,000 people were killed. His current term ends in 2020.\nSuspected opponents were “killed, raped, abducted, beaten, and intimidated,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement, adding it had documented at least 15 killings, six rapes and eight abductions.
