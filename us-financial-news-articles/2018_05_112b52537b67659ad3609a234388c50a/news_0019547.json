Since acquisition, Trovit has continued its rapid growth and now provides services across 57 countries with over 1 billion visits annually.\nThrough the combination of both Trovit and Mitula's advanced technology, its large number of users around the world, and experienced management, LIFULL will expand its commitment to provide a superior search experience and a broader range of advertising services and opportunities to help people find their next home, cars or job.\nMr Gonzalo del Pozo, CEO of the Mitula Group , said: \"Trovit and Mitula Group have both developed leading positions in the vertical search space for cars, jobs and homes and are a natural fit in terms of strategy, employee skills and capabilities, product set, customer base and global footprint. The merging of the two businesses will create a significant player in the global online classifieds industry.\"\nTrovit's CEO, Mauricio Silber , said: \"It makes a lot of sense to bring together the operations of Mitula and Trovit to provide our combined customer base with access to a superior range of advertising products and services across a network reaching over 170 million visits each month.\"\nSummary Information on Mitula Group Limited\nName: Mitula Group Limited\nAddress: Enrique Granados, 6 Edificio B - 2º planta 28224 Pozuelo de Alarcón, Madrid (Spain) CEO: Gonzalo del Pozo / CEO、Board Director、Founder\nPrincipal Business: operation of aggregator* websites and portal sites for real estate, job listing, used car, and fashion information\nCapital: 33,826,233 AUD\nEstablished: 2009\nListing: Australian Securities Exchange (Code: MUA)\n*Aggregator Website integrates information from multiple websites into one, allowing website users to access the compiled information at a single website.\nAbout LIFULL Co., Ltd.\nLIFULL Co., Ltd. is a company that operates real estate and housing information services.
