(“Opiant”) (NASDAQ:OPNT), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, and provided a corporate update.\n“We began 2018 with multiple significant accomplishments,” said Roger Crystal, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Opiant. “Most importantly, following positive data from a Phase I clinical study and a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we initiated a development program for OPNT003 (intranasal nalmefene), a long acting treatment for opioid overdose. In support of this program, we were recently awarded a grant of approximately $7.4 million from the National Institutes of Health’s (“NIH”) National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”). We intend to pursue a 505(b)(2) development path for OPNT003 and anticipate the potential to submit a New Drug Application in 2020. Beyond our innovative pipeline, NARCAN® Nasal Spray for opioid overdose continues to generate strong revenue growth.”\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nInitiated a development program for OPNT003, a long acting treatment for opioid overdose Awarded a grant of approximately $7.4 million from NIDA for the development of OPNT003\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Opiant recorded approximately $1.7 million in revenue, compared to approximately $11,000 during the corresponding period of 2017. The increase was due primarily to the recognition of net revenue of $1.6 million arising from the royalty payments from the sale, by Adapt Pharma Operations Limited (“Adapt”), of NARCAN.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were approximately $3.0 million, compared to approximately $1.9 million in the comparable period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $0.6 million increase associated with stock-based compensation expense, a $0.4 million increase relating to professional fees and a $0.1 million increase attributed to employee compensation and related expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were approximately $2.4 million, compared to approximately $0.9 million during the corresponding period of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in expense associated with shares issuable to a research and development partner, a $0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $0.3 million increase attributed to research and development employee compensation and related expenses.\nLicense fees for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $5.6 million. The license fees relate to the License Agreement with Adapt. There were no license fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company did not record any selling expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $9.3 million, or a loss of $3.68 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.8 million, or a loss of $1.39 per basic and diluted share, for the comparable period of 2017. The significant increase in net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily caused by the non-reoccurring license fee of $5.6 million paid to Adapt.\nAt March 31, 2018, Opiant had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $11.3 million, compared to $8.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nAbout Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOpiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions.
