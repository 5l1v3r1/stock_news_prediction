(NASDAQ: SIGI) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income per diluted share was $0.32 compared to $0.85 a year ago, and non-GAAP operating income 1 per diluted share was $0.46 compared to $0.86 a year ago.\n\"Our significant progress in generating profitable growth was masked by elevated catastrophe and non-catastrophe property losses, primarily related to the severe winter weather we experienced,\" said Gregory E. Murphy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We incurred $26 million of catastrophe losses and $106 million of total non-catastrophe insured property losses, which together exceeded our expectations by approximately $33 million, or $0.44 per share in the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating return on average equity (\"ROE\") 1 was 6.5%, underperforming our target of 12.0% for 2018. While the first quarter financial results did not meet our expectations, events such as these reinforce the value we bring to our distribution partners and customers through our prompt response and excellent customer service that rebuild their lives and businesses.\"\nMr. Murphy continued, \"Net premiums written grew 4% in the quarter, driven by continued solid growth in our standard commercial and personal lines segments, offset by a decline in premiums for excess and surplus lines. We achieved commercial lines renewal pure price increases of 3.2% during 2018, which was up from the full year 2017 level of 2.9%, while maintaining an impressive 85% retention rate. We are proud of our inside underwriters' ability to continue to generate renewal pure price increases that were in excess of expected overall claim inflation. Excess and surplus premiums declined in the quarter as we continued our efforts to improve profitability in this line through targeted underwriting actions. After-tax net investment income increased 30% in the quarter, to $36 million, driven largely by the implementation of tax reform this year, coupled with higher pre-tax yields on our fixed income investments.\"\nOperating Highlights\nConsolidated Financial Results\nQuarter ended March 31,\nChange\n$ and shares in millions, except per share data\n2018\n2017\nNet premiums written\n$\n624.6\n598.7\n4\n%\nNet premiums earned\n591.8\n560.9\n6\nNet investment income earned\n43.2\n37.4\n16\nNet realized and unrealized losses, pre-tax\n(10.5)\n(1.0)\n(909)\nTotal revenues\n626.7\n600.5\n4\nNet underwriting income, after-tax\n3.7\n32.0\n(88)\nNet investment income, after-tax\n35.8\n27.5\n30\nNet income\n18.9\n50.4\n(62)\nNon-GAAP operating income 1\n27.3\n51.1\n(47)\nCombined ratio\n99.2\n%\n91.2\n8.0\npts\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n65.0\n56.6\n8.4\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n33.8\n34.6\n(0.8)\nDividends to policyholders ratio\n0.4\n—\n0.4\nCatastrophe losses\n4.4\npts\n2.2\n2.2\nNon-catastrophe property losses\n17.9\n12.7\n5.2\n(Favorable) prior year statutory reserve development on casualty lines\n(1.4)\n(2.6)\n1.2\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n0.32\n0.85\n(62)\n%\nNon-GAAP operating income per diluted share 1\n0.46\n0.86\n(47)\nWeighted average diluted shares\n59.6\n59.1\n1\nBook value per share\n$\n28.25\n27.34\n3\nStandard Commercial Lines\nStandard Commercial Lines premiums, which represented 82% of our first quarter 2018 net premiums written, were up 5% in the quarter compared to a year ago. This growth reflects strong renewal pure price increases of 3.2%, excellent retention of 85%, and new business growth of 9%, to $98 million. The combined ratio in the first quarter was 98.5% an increase of 8.2 points from a year ago, driven by an increase in catastrophe losses of 2.7 points, an increase in non-catastrophe property losses of 3.8 points, and lower levels of favorable prior year casualty reserve development.\nStandard Commercial Lines\nQuarter ended March 31,\nChange\n$ in millions\n2018\n2017\nNet premiums written\n$\n509.1\n483.5\n5\n%\nNet premiums earned\n465.4\n438.4\n6\nCombined ratio\n98.5\n%\n90.3\n8.2\npts\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n63.0\n55.1\n7.9\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n35.0\n35.2\n(0.2)\nDividends to policyholders ratio\n0.5\n—\n0.5\nCatastrophe losses\n4.3\npts\n1.6\n2.7\nNon-catastrophe property losses\n15.2\n11.4\n3.8\n(Favorable) prior year statutory reserve development on casualty lines\n(1.7)\n(3.7)\n2.0\nStandard Personal Lines\nStandard Personal Lines premiums, which represented 11% of our first quarter 2018 net premiums written, increased 5% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven largely by strong renewal pure price increases of 3.8%, excellent retention of 85%, and a 4% increase in new business, to $12 million. The combined ratio in the first quarter was 102.0%, a 9.2-point increase from a year ago, which was driven by increases in non-catastrophe property losses of 11.6 points and catastrophe losses of 3.7 points. The elevated losses were partially offset by a 3.2 point decrease in the expense ratio and an improvement in prior year casualty development of 2.8 points compared to last year.\nStandard Personal Lines\nQuarter ended March 31,\nChange\n$ in millions\n2018\n2017\nNet premiums written\n$\n67.9\n64.7\n5\n%\nNet premiums earned\n74.3\n71.2\n4\nCombined ratio\n102.0\n%\n92.8\n9.2\npts\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n74.6\n62.2\n12.4\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n27.4\n30.6\n(3.2)\nCatastrophe losses\n9.2\npts\n5.5\n3.7\nNon-catastrophe property losses\n34.5\n22.9\n11.6\nUnfavorable prior year statutory reserve development on casualty lines\n—\n2.8\n(2.8)\nExcess and Surplus Lines\nExcess and Surplus Lines premiums, which represented 7% of our first quarter 2018 net premiums written, decreased 6% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by a 23% reduction in new business, reflecting our focus on improving profitability by implementing price increases and targeted underwriting actions. The combined ratio for the first quarter was 101.1%, 4.2 points higher than a year ago. This increase was mainly driven by an increase in current year loss costs of 4.8 points, coupled with elevated non-catastrophe property losses that were 7.5 points higher than a year ago. These impacts were partially offset by reductions in catastrophe losses of 3.9 points and the expense ratio of 3.1 points compared to a year ago.\nExcess and Surplus Lines\nQuarter ended March 31,\nChange\n$ in millions\n2018\n2017\nNet premiums written\n$\n47.6\n50.5\n(6)\n%\nNet premiums earned\n52.2\n51.2\n2\nCombined ratio\n101.1\n%\n96.9\n4.2\npts\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n69.0\n61.7\n7.3\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n32.1\n35.2\n(3.1)\nCatastrophe losses\n(1.2)\npts\n2.7\n(3.9)\nNon-catastrophe property losses\n17.8\n10.3\n7.5\nInvestment Income\nAfter-tax net investment income in the first quarter was $36 million, up 30% compared to a year ago.

They are used as important financial measures by management, analysts, and investors, because the realization of net investment gains and losses on sales of securities in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing. In addition, these net realized investment gains and losses, as well as other-than-temporary investment impairments that are charged to earnings, and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, could distort the analysis of trends. These operating measurements are not intended as a substitute for net income, earnings per share, or return on equity prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reconciliations of net income, earnings per share, and return on equity to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating earnings per diluted share, and non-GAAP operating return on average equity, respectively, are provided in the tables below.\nNote: All amounts included in this release exclude intercompany transactions.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income\n$ in millions\nQuarter ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n18.9\n50.4\nExclude: Net realized (gains) losses and OTTI\n(3.5)\n1.0\nExclude: Net unrealized losses\n14.1\n—\nNet realized losses, OTTI, and unrealized losses\n10.5\n1.0\nExclude: Tax on net realized losses, OTTI, and unrealized losses\n(2.2)\n(0.4)\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n27.3\n51.1\nReconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share to Non-GAAP Operating Income per Diluted Share\nQuarter ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n0.32\n0.85\nExclude: Net realized (gains) losses and OTTI\n(0.06)\n0.02\nExclude: Net unrealized losses\n0.24\n—\nNet realized losses, OTTI, and unrealized losses\n0.18\n0.02\nExclude: Tax on net realized losses, OTTI, and unrealized losses\n(0.04)\n(0.01)\nNon-GAAP operating income per diluted share\n$\n0.46\n0.86\nReconciliation of ROE to Non-GAAP Operating ROE\nQuarter ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nReturn on Average Equity\n4.5\n%\n12.9\nExclude: Net realized (gains) losses and OTTI\n(0.8)\n0.3\nExclude: Net unrealized losses\n3.3\n—\nNet realized losses, OTTI, and unrealized losses\n2.5\n0.3\nExclude: Tax on net realized losses, OTTI, and unrealized losses\n(0.5)\n(0.1)\nNon-GAAP Operating Return on Average Equity\n6.5\n%\n13.1\nNote: Amounts in the tables above may not foot due to rounding.\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn this press release, Selective and its management discuss and make statements based on currently available information regarding their intentions, beliefs, current expectations, and projections regarding Selective's future operations and performance.\nCertain statements in this report, including information incorporated by reference, are \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\").
