(OTCQB:QUES), a specialty systems integrator focused on field and supply chain mobility announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Results:\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Quest Solution (Quest) reported revenues of $15.2 million, compared to $14.3 million in the comparable 2017 period. The Company achieved sequential revenue growth of 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin of 21% was consistent with the first quarter of 2017. Total operating expenses for first quarter of 2018 increased to $3.8 million, primarily related to the Company’s adoption of an equity incentive plan, increases in sales commissions related to revenue growth, increased professional fees attributable to the turnaround process and the Debt elimination. Net loss attributable to the common stockholders was $1 million, or a loss of $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $0.4 million, or a loss of $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus Stock Based Compensation and one-time fees mainly related to the turnaround process) for the first quarter of 2018 improved by 18% to $656,000 compared to $555,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Shareholders’ equity improved to a deficit of $0.3 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to a deficit of $1.2 million at December 31, 2017 and a deficit of $14.9 million at March 31, 2017.\nShai Lustgarten, CEO, commented, “Quest is now better positioned to execute our strategy, further improve our financial results and drive differentiation in the market place by adding state of the art technologies to our product offering. During the first quarter, we continued to make progress with our turnaround initiatives. Revenue grew due to organic growth in our customer base. Our sales team is focused on strengthening our existing customer relationships to generate new business as needs evolve and capturing new customers to drive incremental revenue growth in our multi Billion USD market place.\n“Much of the increase in operating expenses that we saw in the quarter was related to non-cash equity compensation expense, increased sales commissions due to our reinvigorated sales and marketing effort, as well as some increased professional fees related to the turnaround and debt reduction agreements. Importantly, we drove a 13% reduction in salary expense during the quarter, and we expect operating expenses to moderate as a percentage of sales as we continue to execute the turnaround.\"\nMr. Lustgarten continued, “We previously announced a $15 million reduction of our notes liability, which significantly enhanced our financial structure and provides a solid platform for the Company’s growth. Quest serves blue chip customers operating in attractive, growth industries and we remain focused on exceeding the needs of our existing customers and cultivating new opportunities to increase our market share as we move through 2018.”\nPlease refer to the financial tables included below for a reconciliation of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to non-GAAP financial results.
