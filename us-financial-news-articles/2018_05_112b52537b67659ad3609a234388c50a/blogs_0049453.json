Each will be an expansive 14 acres.\nA Millennium Falcon, which guests will be able to pilot, will be a key attraction.\nSet on the planet Batuu, \"Galaxy's Edge\" will provide a fully immersive experience for guests. Rather than interact with Disney employees, guests will interact with Batuu's residents: a collection of smugglers, bounty hunters, and rogue adventurers. Fly the Millennium Falcon well, and you can expect congratulations from a passerby.\nGetty Images Handout image provided by Disney Parks, Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO Bob Iger announced at D23 EXPO 2015 that Star Wars-themed lands will be coming to Disneyland park in Anaheim, California and Disney's Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. Guests will not be able to purchase regular Disney merchandise either. Rather, unique specialty items will be on sale in Batuu's street markets.\nDisney purchased Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012 for $4.05 billion. That blockbuster deal has proven to be quite the bargain. Since then, Disney has made that money back through its \"Star Wars\" films alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:34:45.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
