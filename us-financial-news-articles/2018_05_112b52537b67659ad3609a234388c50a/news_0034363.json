The dividend will be payable on June 8, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 29, 2018. Prior to the payment of this dividend, Switch, Ltd. will make a cash distribution to all holders of record of common units of Switch, Ltd., including Switch, of $0.0147 per common unit.\nFuture declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of Switch's Board of Directors based on its consideration of many factors, including Switch's results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions in Switch, Ltd.'s debt agreements and other factors that Switch's Board of Directors deems relevant.\nRecent Business Highlights\nAnnounced a 15MW colocation deal with an international streaming media corporation that plans to use Switch's North American PRIME data centers as a worldwide distribution hub for its services.

Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $216 million to $224 million. Capital expenditures in the range of $260 million to $310 million.\nSwitch does not provide reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures included in the 2018 guidance above due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including net income, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges, gains or losses on retirement of debt and variations in effective tax rate, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, but which are excluded from Switch's calculations of Adjusted EBITDA.\nUpcoming Conferences and Events\nSwitch management will participate in the following investor conferences:\nJ.P. Morgan 46th Annual Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference on May 17, 2018 in Boston, MA. William Blair 38th Annual Growth Conference on June 13, 2018, in Chicago, IL.\nConference Call Information\nSwitch will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on May 14, 2018.

Amounts for the period from January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated financial statements herein represent the historical operations of Switch, Ltd. and its subsidiaries.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Switch's condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Switch uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP measures, in this press release. Switch defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and for specific and defined supplemental adjustments to exclude (i) non-cash equity-based compensation expense; (ii) equity in net losses of investments; and (iii) certain other items that Switch believes are not indicative of its core operating performance. Switch defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\nThe presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. In addition, the non-GAAP measures exclude certain recurring expenses that have been and will continue to be significant expenses of Switch's business.\nSwitch believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operational-decision making.\nFor more information on Switch's non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.
