That's \"an event not seen since at least 2003 (when my records begin),\" Silverblatt said.\nHe also said, citing initial reports, that buybacks \"produced an outrageous 72% gain due to a few significant issue level increases, but even excluding those buybacks they are up between 25% and 42% depending on the exclusions.\"\nThe strong shareholder returns follow the slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate. Late last year, President Donald Trump signed a bill that cut the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.\nBut despite the tax cut and the strong shareholder returns expected by Silverblatt, the S&P 500 is down more than 1 percent for 2018, signalling investors may need all the returns they can get.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T19:51:44.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
