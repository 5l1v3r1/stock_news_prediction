The number of carriers would be unrestricted for one group, while some restrictions would be placed on the other.\nThe measures will go into effect on Oct. 1 this year, it said. The CAAC issued a draft of the proposed regulations in August.\nThe CAAC implemented the “one route, one airline” policy in 2009 for long-haul routes to prevent the country’s mostly state-backed airlines from competing too aggressively against each other on routes that were hard to profit from.\nThe country’s three largest state carriers are Air China Ltd ( 601111.SS ) ( 0753.HK ), China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd ( 600115.SS ) ( 0670.HK ) and China Southern Airlines Co Ltd ( 600029.SS ) ( 1055.HK ).
