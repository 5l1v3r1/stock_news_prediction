Stephens, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"During the first quarter, we continued to work as a team to ready our company for its pending merger with Ameris Bancorp. I am proud of our performance and the concerted effort of our employees to ensure this transition will be as smooth as possible for our customers. We are looking forward to closing our transaction, which has now received both regulatory and stockholder approvals, and joining the team at Ameris.\"\nOther significant aspects of the first quarter of 2018 included:\nNet interest income increased 12% to $7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment) increased 7% to $792.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $741.8 million at March 31, 2017, but declined 6% from $842.8 million at December 31, 2017. Deposits decreased 7% to $640.7 million at March 31, 2018, from $685.8 million at March 31, 2017, and 5% from $675.8 million at December 31, 2017. Total assets was virtually flat at $928.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $923.5 million at March 31, 2017, and declined 6% from $983.3 million at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, declined to 1.07% at March 31, 2018, compared with 1.36% at March 31, 2017, but increased from 0.97% at December 31, 2017. The Bank's ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted total assets were 13.54% and 9.91%, respectively, at March 31, 2018, and each continued to exceed the levels required by regulation, currently 10% and 5%, respectively, for a bank to be considered well-capitalized.\nTracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, \"Due to the efforts of our team to continue executing our strategic plan, despite our pending merger, net interest margin was 3.22% for the first quarter of 2018, consistent with both the first and fourth quarters of 2017.\"\nBank Regulatory Capital\nAt Key Capital Measures\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nTotal risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 13.54 % 12.53 % 13.76 % Common equity tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets)\n12.38 % 11.43 % 12.56 % Tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.38 % 11.43 % 12.56 % Tier 1 (core) capital ratio (to adjusted total assets) 9.91 % 9.67 % 10.32 % The increase in risk-weighted capital ratios at March 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017, reflected a decrease in risk-weighted assets due to the decrease in total loans and an increase in equity due to accumulated earnings, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. The decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios at March 31, 2018, compared with March 31, 2017, reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets, due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in investment securities, as well as an increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan categories, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in equity due to accumulated earnings.\nCredit Quality\nAt March 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(Dollars in millions) Nonperforming loans $ 8.2 $ 7.8 $ 9.8 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.07 % 1.02 % 1.42 % Other real estate owned $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ 2.8 Nonperforming assets $ 9.9 $ 9.5 $ 12.6 Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.07 % 0.97 % 1.36 % Troubled debt restructurings performing for less than 12 months under terms of modification (1)\n$ 14.9 $ 15.2 $ 13.6 Troubled debt restructurings performing for more than 12 months under terms of modification\n$ 16.1 $ 15.7 $ 18.9\n(1) Includes $6.4 million, $5.9 million and $7.6 million of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nDue to the Company's generally stable credit quality during 2017 and continuing into 2018, which reflected an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to nonperforming, the Company's loan loss provision remained at a low level for the three months ended March 31, 2018, while maintaining, in management's view, a stable and adequate ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans (see table below).\nProvision / Allowance for Loan Losses\nAt and for the\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(Dollars in millions) Provision for portfolio loan losses $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 Allowance for portfolio loan losses $ 8.6 $ 8.6 $ 8.3 Allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans 1.12 % 1.12 % 1.20 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses to nonperforming loans 104.97 % 110.43 % 84.67 % Net charge-offs (recoveries) $ 0.2 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average outstanding portfolio loans (annualized)\n0.09 % 0.02 % 0.00 % Net charge-offs totaled $168,000 and $39,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, while net recoveries totaled $8,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This reflects a trend of solid economic conditions across the Company's markets, which has led to continued low levels of net charge-offs during the last 12 months; however, the increase in net charge-offs during the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflected increased charge-offs in commercial real estate loans, manufactured home loans, and home equity loans.\nThe Company's provision for portfolio loan losses has remained within a relatively narrow range over the past year. The increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at March 31, 2018, compared with that at March 31, 2017, was attributable primarily to loan growth, which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that were offset partially by loan sales, principal amortization, and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan losses at March 31, 2018, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period.\nNet Interest Income Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(Dollars in millions) Net interest income $ 7.1 $ 7.2 $ 6.4 Net interest margin 3.22 % 3.24 % 3.20 % Yield on investment securities 2.13 % 2.09 % 2.42 % Yield on loans 4.38 % 4.47 % 4.26 % Total cost of funds 1.03 % 1.03 % 0.80 % Average cost of deposits 0.86 % 0.85 % 0.67 % Rates paid on borrowed funds 1.74 % 1.83 % 1.77 % Net interest margin was relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. The slight changes were primarily due to varying levels of interest-earning assets outstanding. Additionally, the increase in interest-earning assets during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with March 31, 2017, was partially offset by an increase in interest expense in the first quarter of 2018.\nNoninterest Income / Noninterest Expense / Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(Dollars in millions) Noninterest income $ 1.2 $ 1.3 $ 2.6 Noninterest expense $ 6.4 $ 6.4 $ 6.6 Income tax expense $ 0.4 $ 2.5 $ 0.8 The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with that of the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale. The decrease in noninterest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with that of the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily reflected a decrease in foreclosed asset expenses, interchange expenses, and other miscellaneous operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits, as well as costs associated with the merger with Ameris Bancorp.\nThe decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with that of the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflected a reduction in the valuation of the Company's net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with that of the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily reflected the decrease in effective tax rate as a result of the newly enacted tax legislation, which decreased the maximum federal income tax rate by 14%, as well as a decline in income before income tax expense.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nA non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Core earnings and core earnings per diluted share exclude the effects of certain transactions that occurred during the period, as detailed in the following reconciliation of these measures.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(Dollars in thousands) Net income, as reported $ 1,416 $ (616 ) $ 1,477 Plus merger-related costs (1) 232 400 -- Plus impact of newly enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets (2) -- 1,641 -- Adjusted net income (core earnings) $ 1,648 $ 1,425 $ 1,477 Income per diluted share, as reported $ 0.09 $ (0.04 ) $ 0.10 Plus merger-related costs 0.02 0.03 -- Plus impact of newly enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets (2) -- 0.11 -- Adjusted income per diluted share (core earnings per diluted share) (3) $ 0.11 $ 0.09 $ 0.10\n(1) The merger-related costs, which are included in noninterest expense, totaled $233,000 and is shown above net of a tax expense adjustment of $1,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The merger-related costs totaled $443,000 and is shown above net of a tax expense adjustment of $43,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n(2) The impact of newly enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets is included in income tax expense.\n(3) May not foot due to rounding.\nCore earnings and core earnings per diluted share should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and income per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Atlantic Coast's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Atlantic Coast's management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures aid investors in analyzing the Company's business trends and in understanding the Company's performance. In addition, the Company may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes.\nAbout the Company\nAtlantic Coast Financial Corporation is the holding company for Atlantic Coast Bank, a Florida state-chartered commercial bank.
