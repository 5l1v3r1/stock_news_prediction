Once a champion always a champion. She has the mentality and the head. It’s just a matter of can she get the body back. It would be miraculous but if anybody can pull it off it’s her.” SHARAPOVA RETURNS\nSharapova has endured a rocky road since coming back a year ago. The French Open declined to give her a wildcard, she missed Wimbledon with injury and made the last 16 at the U.S. Open and this year’s Australian Open.\nShe failed to win a match between January and May but after a run to the Rome semi-finals the 31-year-old arrives in Paris looking a little more like her old self.\n“She has a shot for sure,” said Evert. “She knows she can win it and knows she is mentally tougher than most.”\nA Halep triumph would be the popular choice for many.\nShe looked poised to get her hands on the Suzanne Lenglen Cup a year ago when she led Latvian firebrand Ostapenko by a set and 3-0 but her dream faded under a barrage of winners.\nThis year the 26-year-old slogged her way to the Australian Open final but ran out of gas on a steamy Melbourne night — losing to Wozniacki.\nEvert fears their might be more heartache in store.\n“I think if she can keep it together mentally she would be my favourite but the problem with Halep is that because of her build and style she has to work so hard for every point,” Evert said.\n“She needs to have some easy matches for her to be able to win the tournament I think.” (Reporting by Martyn Herman Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T14:26:45.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
