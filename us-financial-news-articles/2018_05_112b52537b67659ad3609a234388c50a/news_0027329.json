Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $1,028.2 million compared to $1,117.4 million for the first quarter of last year. The revenue decrease was primarily attributable to various electrical projects in New York that are completed or nearing completion, as well as reduced project execution activity on a large tunnel project on the West Coast that is also nearing completion. Net loss attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2017 of $13.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. The results for the first quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by an unfavorable pre-tax charge of $17.8 million (an after-tax impact of $12.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share), which was due to the unexpected outcome of an arbitration decision related to a subcontractor dispute on a Civil segment project in New York that was completed in 2013. The volume reduction mentioned above also contributed to the lower net income for the first quarter of 2018.\nBacklog as of March 31, 2018 was $8.5 billion, a record high, and up 18% compared to $7.2 billion as of March 31, 2017. New awards and adjustments to contracts in process totaled $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2018. Significant new awards included the previously announced $1.4 billion Newark Liberty International Airport Terminal One Design-Build project, a government office building project in California valued at $215 million, and various electrical projects in New York and in the western and southern United States collectively valued at $147 million.\nDemand for Tutor Perini’s construction services remains strong, especially in the civil and specialty end markets. Subsequent to the first quarter, the Company was identified as the low bidder on several new civil projects, including the $800 million Southwest Light Rail Transit (METRO Green Line Extension) project in Minneapolis, a $109 million tunneling project in Los Angeles and a $93 million bridge project in New York City. The Company anticipates booking the contract awards for these projects as soon as the second quarter of 2018.\n“Our earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were below expectations, largely because of the unexpected arbitration decision. However, we anticipate that stronger performance later this year should offset the weakness experienced this quarter,” remarked Ronald Tutor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our record backlog and $1 billion of pending civil awards reflect our continued success in capturing significant project opportunities. We believe that we are well positioned to win even more, sizable civil awards as long-term funding is released, which should result in continued backlog growth.”\nOutlook and Guidance\nBased on the current backlog and market outlook, the Company is affirming its guidance for 2018, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) expected in the range of $1.90 to $2.30. As previously noted in our earnings release for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be weighted towards the second half of the year, consistent with the cyclicality of the Company’s business.\nFirst Quarter Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific Time on Wednesday, May 9, 2017, to discuss the first quarter 2018 results.
