Trading has been jittery due to wariness about the government's resolve and ability to maintain market-friendly policies in the midst of disruptive work stoppages by the nation's truckers and oil workers. The index spent the morning in the red, but a pickup in trading helped move it into positive territory later in the session. Petrobras was the center of attention as the company's preferred and common shares fell 1.7 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, as workers at the company walked off the job. Various media outlets, including Reuters, reported that President Michel Temer may force Petrobras to ditch its market-based fuel pricing system. The losses in Petrobras' shares had been steeper until Temer's office said he was committed to the firm's financial health and would preserve its pricing policies. Traders in general said they were worried about the stability of the already fragile government. Temer on Tuesday was forced to swat away questions from journalists about the possibility of a military coup. Market participants are also trying the measure the costs of a 10-day truckers' strike that is now winding down. \"The market remains very fragile,\" said one Rio de Janeiro-based trader. \"Despite improvements, the situation is not resolved, and losses still need to be figured out.\" The Bovespa, which has fallen about 10 percent since May 16, closed up 0.9 percent, amid a generally positive day for equities in Latin America. The country's currency, the real , edged up 0.07 percent to about 3.74 reais per dollar. Among the gainers on the Bovespa was electronics and appliance retailer Magazine Luiza SA, ending up 3.8 percent, after fears of major supply disruptions subsided. Also trading higher was highway operator Ecorodovias , which climbed 3 percent, recouping dramatic losses over the last two weeks as politicians lowered toll revenue targets to assuage the protesting truckers. Meanwhile, Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index closed up slightly, while the Mexican peso climbed 0.5 percent against the dollar.\nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 2200 GMT:\nStock indexes Latest Daily YTD pct pct change\nchange\nMSCI Emerging Markets 1,112.75 -1.2 -3.94 MSCI LatAm 2,565.09 0.23 -9.3 Brazil Bovespa 76,753.61 0.9 0.46 Mexico S&P/BMV IPC 44,715.88 0.15 -9.40 Chile IPSA 5,484.90 -0.17 -1.43 Chile IGPA 27,786.61 -0.16 -0.69 Argentina MerVal 28,389.40 0.23 -5.58 Colombia IGBC 12,302.82 0.80 8.20 Venezuela IBC 34,894.65 0.57 2662.54 Currencies Latest Daily YTD pct pct change\nchange\nBrazil real 3.7367 0.07 -11.33 Mexico peso 19.7290 0.50 -0.15 Chile peso 627.80 0.32 -2.09 Colombia peso 2,877.50 0.99 3.63 Peru sol 3.270 0.18 -1.01 Argentina peso 24.925 -0.20 -25.38\n(interbank)\nArgentina peso 25.85 -0.19 -25.61\n(parallel)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T02:01:51.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
