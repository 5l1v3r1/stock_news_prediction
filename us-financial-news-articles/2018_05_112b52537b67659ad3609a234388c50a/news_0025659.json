(NASDAQ:INO), a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of DNA immunotherapies targeted against cancers and infectious diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, along with a general business update.\nInovio Highlights\nVGX-3100 . A total of 60 sites globally are open and recruiting for REVEAL 1 (Phase 3 clinical trial for treating cervical dysplasia (CIN) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)); recruiting patients in Phase 2 study for treating vulvar dysplasia (VIN) and associated diseases. MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab advanced to the Phase 2 efficacy stage of the trial, triggering a milestone payment to Inovio. MedImmune is evaluating MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab, its PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with recurrent/metastatic HPV-associated HNSCC in a clinical trial with an estimated total enrollment of 50 patients. INO-5401 . Opening sites for Phase 1/2a study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and preliminary clinical efficacy of INO-5401 and INO-9012 in combination with Roche/Genentech’s atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent urothelial carcinoma (UCa); opening sites for Phase 1/2 study to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of INO-5401 and INO-9012 in combination with Regeneron’s cemiplimab in participants with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). INO-1800 . Inovio’s treatment for hepatitis B infection is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study in which it has generated virus-specific T cells with a favorable safety profile to date. Inovio continues its partnering discussions and plans to report additional data from this trial at upcoming scientific conferences and in a publication in 2018. Executed collaboration and partnering agreement with ApolloBio . Inovio received an upfront payment of $23 million (approximately $19.4 million after payment of required taxes) from ApolloBio, which gained the rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize VGX-3100 to treat precancers caused by HPV, within Greater China. Entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy . The agreement provides that Inovio and the Parker Institute will undertake clinical evaluation of novel combination regimens within the field of immuno-oncology. Under the agreement, the Parker Institute will have responsibility for funding and clinical study execution, working in collaboration with its established network. Inovio will provide financial contributions if Inovio's product(s) studied under the collaboration reaches the initiation of a Phase 3 study. Established partnership with CEPI (in April) . Inovio will develop vaccine candidates against Lassa fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) will directly fund up to $56 million to support Inovio’s pre-clinical and clinical advancement through Phase 2 of INO-4500, its Lassa fever vaccine, and INO-4700, its MERS vaccine, over a five-year period. GENEOS Therapeutics, Inc. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, GENEOS Therapeutics, Inc., which is developing neoantigen-based personalized cancer therapies, plans to raise capital in 2018 to fund the development of its programs. Cash Position. As of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $112.8 million compared to $127.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDr. J. Joseph Kim, Inovio’s President & CEO said, “During the first quarter of 2018, Inovio has made significant progress in its clinical trials, while continuing to secure corporate partnerships and obtain significant non-dilutive funding. These accomplishments further validate our proprietary ASPIRE™ technology targeting cancer and emerging infectious diseases in addition to positioning us as a global leader for treating a wide spectrum of HPV-related diseases. We look forward to building on our treatment capabilities, while continuing to expand on our partnering successes from the first quarter.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10.4 million for the same period in 2017. Total operating expenses were $34.3 million compared to $32.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nAs a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , beginning on January 1, 2018, all contributions received from current grant agreements have been recorded as a contra-expense as opposed to revenue on the consolidated statement of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, $2.2 million was recorded as contra-research and development expense which would have been classified as grant revenue in the prior year. Had this change in presentation not occurred, total revenue would have been $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10.4 million for the same period in 2017. Total operating expenses would have been $36.5 million compared to $32.3 million for the prior year period.\nInovio’s net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $32.4 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, compared to $23.1 million, or $0.31 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nRevenue\nThe decrease in comparable revenue and grant agreement recognition for the first quarter 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the prior year revenue recognized from the termination payment received from Roche during the first quarter of 2017 of $4.0 million. The decrease was also due to a decrease in grant funding recognized from our Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Ebola grant of $4.7 million, partially offset by an increase in grant funding recognized from our Zika virus sub-grant of $1.2 million.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $24.6 million compared to $24.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily related to our VGX-3100 clinical trials, activities under our collaboration with MedImmune and an increase in employee headcount to support our clinical trial activities and partnerships. These increases were offset by the $2.2 million contra-research and development expense recorded from grant agreements as discussed above, as well as a decrease in expenses related to the DARPA Ebola grant as it nears completion.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $9.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 versus $7.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily related to the Chinese taxes and advisory fees incurred in connection with the ApolloBio upfront payment we received, offset by a decrease in non-cash stock based compensation.\nCapital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $112.8 million compared to $127.4 million as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 90.7 million common shares outstanding and 102.3 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to outstanding options, warrants, restricted stock units and convertible preferred stock.\nInovio’s balance sheet and statement of operations are provided below.
