Ramaphosa told Mahumapelo on Thursday to resign or lose his job, the Mail & Guardian newspaper cited sources as saying.\nANC spokesman Pule Mabe did not return calls seeking comment.\nReporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by James Macharia and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T19:33:52.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
