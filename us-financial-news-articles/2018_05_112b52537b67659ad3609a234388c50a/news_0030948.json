Temasek declined to comment.\nLima said Ophir also has a third financing option which it has not yet presented to the government, describing all bank talks as advanced.\n“The problem is Ophir ... Ophir needs to make up its mind, decide which financing it wants and execute it,” Lima said.\nSources say Japanese and South Korean banks are also being sounded out.\nGUNVOR OFF-TAKE DEAL IN DOUBT\nStruggles to fix loans have not only left the project’s commercial structure in doubt, but jeopardised Geneva-based trader Gunvor’s [GGL.UL] claim to the LNG.\nIn a competitive tender last year, the trader beat Vitol [VITOLV.UL], Royal Dutch Shell, Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] and Centrica to bag between half and all of Fortuna’s supply for 10 years.\nDespite that, Shell, Vitol and Trafigura are once again in talks to buy the LNG, industry and government-linked sources said.\nGunvor, Vitol, Trafigura and Shell declined to comment.\nBut the companies also face competition from would-be lenders.\n“Whoever pays is the boss,” Lima said, adding that a Chinese or Singaporean lender would likely insist on claiming the LNG to maximize value from the deal.\nAdditional reporting by Colin Leopold at Project Finance International, Ron Bousso in London; Editing by Veronica Brown and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:54:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
