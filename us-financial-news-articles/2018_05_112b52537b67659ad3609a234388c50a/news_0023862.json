I’m looking forward to spending my time in Ukraine in an experience of a lifetime,” he said via instant messenger.\nThe final will be the biggest soccer fixture in Ukraine since it co-hosted the European Championship in 2012.\nSince then a pro-European uprising in Kiev ousted a pro-Russian president, while a Moscow-backed insurgency in Ukraine’s eastern regions sparked an ongoing conflict with government troops.\nMany Ukrainians are keen to welcome visitors and show their country has recovered from the worst of the political and economic crisis.\nSome government officials have also offered to host fans including Minister of Information Policy Yuriy Stets.\n“We’d like to invite family of fans to stay in our apartment for few days during The Final for free. The only 2 conditions: 40+ age and to be Real Madrid fan (Sorry, Liverpool) See U in Kyiv!,” Stets wrote in a post on Facebook that included an emoticon of a winking face.\nEditing by Matthias Williams and Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:51:26.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
