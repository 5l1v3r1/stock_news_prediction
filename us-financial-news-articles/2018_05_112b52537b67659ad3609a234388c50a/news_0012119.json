The White House has said the first meeting between the sitting US and North Korean leaders could take place in coming weeks.\nIn February, ICAO’s Asia and Pacific regional office in Bangkok received a letter from North Korea’s civil aviation administration asking to establish new air routes between the Pyongyang flight information region (FIR) and South Korea’s Incheon FIR.\nMontreal-based ICAO cannot impose binding rules on governments, but wields clout through its safety and security standards which are approved by its 192 member states.\nReporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal.
