Privacy must be ensured every step of the way. Also, medical centers are stuck on older systems, with 78 percent of physician practices in the U.S. using legacy software as of 2013, despite the fact that one-third to two-thirds of physicians surveyed are dissatisfied with the technology, according to a 2016 report in the online journal \"Perspectives in Health Information Management.\"\nThe dream scenario for Apple, and potentially for iPhone users, is a digital hub similar to how iTunes centralizes your music.\nThe GAO report lays out some of the challenges. They include storing and sharing documents that are hundreds of pages long, scanning of paper documents with charts that are difficult to read, dealing with a mix of paper and electronic records and protecting the privacy of electronic data.\nThe future of health data On its newsroom page in March, Apple published a story highlighting the need for patient control of data and the work that will be required to get there.\n\"People hand you all sorts of things these days,\" one doctor told Apple . \"More data is almost never bad, but when they show up with paper, how do you summate that?\" He called it \"a very tedious task.\"\nThis isn't music, books or apps, but Apple may be the only company on the planet with the power to push the medical industry in a new direction.\nAs Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer, said in an interview earlier this year , \"We view the future as consumers owning their own health data.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Christina Farr contributed to this report", "external_links": ["https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/691737.pdf", "https://www.apple.com/healthcare/health-records/", "https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/03/doctors-put-patients-in-charge-with-apples-health-records-feature/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4739443/"], "published": "2018-05-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:03:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
