Now, the White House Gift Shop is trying to clear its inventory of the memorabilia by promoting them as the “Deal of the Day.” The price has dropped from $24.95 to $19.95. It was a deal so good that the gift shop website crashed hours after Trump’s announcement.\nThe coins, bordered by a symbolic olive branch, include the faces of Trump and Kim against the backdrop of their respective flags. The White House has distanced itself from the coins, claiming that its has little to do with their production or distribution.\nPeople who bought the commemorative coin before the summit was officially cancelled can request a full refund through the gift shop website. However, the gift shop posted on its website that “most supporters have said they want this heirloom of political history regardless of outcome.”", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander/status/998699492282191872", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep/status/999668149803999232"], "published": "2018-05-25T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T01:14:34.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
