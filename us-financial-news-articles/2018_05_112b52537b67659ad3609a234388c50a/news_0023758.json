But the pair, due to marry just five days later, refused to allow the trauma to delay the ceremony.\nThe Zimbabwean told Reuters TV the crocodile punctured the inflatable boat carrying her and British fiance Jamie Fox, leaving the couple scrambling for their lives in the waters of the Zambezi.\n“Firstly I was just pushing, kicking and trying to fight the croc as much as I could and eventually one of the tour guides managed to pull me out of the water and got me onto one of their canoes,” said Ndlovu.\nThe tour guides also pulled out Fox, and Ndolvu was airlifted to a Bulawayo hospital for treatment. Doctors amputated her shattered arm just above the elbow.\nThe pair married five days later after Ndlovu said she saw no reason to cancel. Friends and relatives attended.\nThe couple plan to settle in Britain. Fox said: “I think the first thing we are going to explore is a fully functioning prosthetic arm.”\nWriting by MacDonald Dzirutwe, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T21:22:08.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
