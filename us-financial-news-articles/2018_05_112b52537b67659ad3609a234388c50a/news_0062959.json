The victory left them 8-18 in May but still within 1 1/2 games of first-place Colorado in the National League West. The Reds have lost four of their last five.\nGodley (5-4) struggled to get out of the first inning, giving up a run on a groundout but stranding two runners after throwing 28 pitches.\nThe Reds also had two runners on base in the third and fourth innings but couldn’t break through against Godley, who won four of his first five starts before losing three straight.\nGodley went six innings, giving up two runs, both earned, on six hits and two walks while striking out seven.\nIn the top of the sixth, he gave up Eugenio Suarez’s 10th home run, a solo shot. The RBI moved Suarez into a tie for the NL lead with 42.\nThe Diamondbacks, who entered the game having scored the second-fewest runs in the majors despite blowing out the Reds 12-5 on Monday, made the most of their four hits. They had little trouble capitalizing on early opportunities against Castillo (4-5), who had won three straight decisions.\nIn the first, Jake Lamb drew a walk with two outs, and Descalso hit his sixth home run for a 2-1 advantage.\nIn the third inning, Jarrod Dyson drew a leadoff walk and then blew through the third base coach’s stop sign in scoring on a double by Ketel Marte. Lamb’s sacrifice fly to left field extended the lead to 4-1.\nArizona added an unearned run in the fifth when Dyson hit a one-out single, went to second on a wild pitch by Castillo and, with two out, scored on a throwing error by shortstop Alex Blandino.\nCastillo went five innings, giving up all five runs, four earned, on four hits and three walks. He struck out six.\nThe Reds scored in the first inning when Blandino doubled to the wall in left field, went to third on a single by Joey Votto, who had two of the Reds’ seven hits, and scored on a groundout by Scooter Gennett.\nYoshihisa Hirano, Archie Bradley and former Reds farmhand Brad Boxberger each pitched a scoreless inning for Arizona. Boxberger notched his 13th save.\nDavid Hernandez and Amir Garrett combined for three scoreless innings in relief of Castillo.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
