Comcast, on the other hand, fell close to 2% and ended the day with a market cap of $147 billion.\nThe new market value puts Netflix just under Disney’s market cap of $153 billion. Many expect Netflix could soon surpass the media giant as it continues to have a strong year.\nThe company’s stock has gone up 70% since January, and surpassed expectations for its first quarter earnings report.\nIt has also earned attention with new high-profile deals like its announcement this week of a multi-year agreement with former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama. While some fans threatened to boycott the service over the news, it was largely seen as a sign of the company’s power and ability to attract big-name talent.
