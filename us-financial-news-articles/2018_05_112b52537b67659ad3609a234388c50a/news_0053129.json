(NASDAQ:RADA) announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Comments\nDov Sella, RADA's Chief Executive Officer commented , “We are pleased with the results of the first quarter, showing a very strong 29% growth in revenues over the first quarter of last year, with an improved level of gross margins. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain our growth momentum into the second quarter, with revenues of approximately $6.5 million, compared to $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, up approximately 22% over last year.”\nContinued Mr. Sella, “We recently opened a new subsidiary in the United States and we have already received initial new orders from some US customers. Our pipeline is deep and strong, with significant revenue potential over the coming years. We are targeting active protection systems (APS) for the US Army and others, Mobile Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) for the US army and US Marine Corps, as well as SHORAD and C-UAV/Drones globally. These are all operational solutions with significant potential for incorporating our tactical radars which work On-The-Move (OTM). As we move through 2018, I am confident that our continuous and long-term investments in software-defined, multi-mission tactical radars for the maneuver force will reap rewards in the quarters and years to come. Beyond the growth engines, we are also pleased with the stability of our digital video recorders business, where we are developing our next-generation solutions to various aircraft manufacturers globally.”\n2018 First Quarter Summary\nRevenues totaled $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 29% compared to revenues of $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross Profit totaled $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 (gross margin of 36.2%) up 31% compared to gross profit of $1.7 million (gross margin of 35.7%) in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses totaled $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 (32.8% of revenues) compared with $1.3 million (28.2% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.
