But we’re used to it, because we know each other,” Pouille told reporters.\n“So I don’t think it’s going to be very different from the other matches. And it’s true that we train a lot together. We played doubles together in Marseille and Dubai practically back to back with four days in between.\n“It’s going to be a difficult match. He’s a very good player. He’s in full progression and very confident.”\nKhachanov edged Pouille over three sets during their last meeting in the final at Marseille in February. 1445 SHARAPOVA OVERCOMES TRICKY VEKIC TEST\nTwo-time champion Maria Sharapova needed five match points to see off Croatia’s Donna Vekic 7-5 6-4 in the second round.\nThe Russian will next face sixth seed Karolina Pliskova, who beat fellow Czech Lucie Safarova 3-6 6-4 6-1.

This year I’ve done that a lot better.”\nEdmund will face 18th seed Italian Fabio Fognini in the third round. 1300 SHAPOVALOV DISAPPOINTED BUT NOT DISHEARTENED\nCanadian teenager Denis Shapovalov was disappointed after his French Open debut ended in the second round but he remains pleased with the progress made this season.\n“Not every week is going to be the same,” he said after a 5-7 7-6(4) 7-5 6-4 defeat to Germany’s Maximilian Marterer.\n“You run into guys that are playing well, playing hot. You know, in Madrid it was me; today it was Max.\n“Obviously I’m disappointed with the loss, but like I said, I’m only 19, so not every week is going to be a semi-finals of, you know, of a big tournament.” 1240 CILIC BOOKS THIRD ROUND SPOT\nThird seed Marin Cilic experienced a difficult test after wasting a match point in the third set against qualifier Hubert Hurkacz, but did enough to win 6-2 6-2,6-7(3) 7-5.\nThe Croat will next face American Steve Johnson, who also needed four sets to beat Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff. 1040 MERTENS DOWNS WATSON\nBelgium’s 16th seed Elise Mertens cruised past Britain’s Heather Watson 6-3 6-4 to match her best Roland Garros performance by reaching the third round for the second year in a row. 1035 MUGURUZA EASES PAST FERRO\nFormer champion Garbine Muguruza, seeded third, looked in fine form as she eased past French wildcard Fiona Ferro 6-4 6-3.\n“The French Open is ‘that’ tournament for me, it’s special, I’m so motivated and I’m so happy,” Muguruza, the 2016 winner, said after the match.\nShe moves into the third round for the fifth consecutive year, where she will face 2010 runner-up Samantha Stosur of Australia.
