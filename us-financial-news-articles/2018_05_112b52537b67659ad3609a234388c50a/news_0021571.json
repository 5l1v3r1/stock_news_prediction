All per share results are reported on a diluted basis.\nFinancial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $185.6 million, or $1.48 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This compares to net income attributable to common shareholders of $21.8 million, or $0.17 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.

This compares to FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $33.3 million, or $0.27 per share. The following items impacted FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding 2017 period:\n($0.19) per share of income from properties sold; ($0.04) per share of loss on debt extinguishment; ($0.02) per share of increase in income tax expense; $0.04 per share of interest expense savings; and $0.01 per of share of increase in interest and other income (net of a $0.04 per share loss on the sale of securities).\nNormalized FFO was $17.5 million, or $0.14 per share. This compares to Normalized FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $29.5 million, or $0.24 per share. The following items impacted Normalized FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding 2017 period:\n($0.19) per share of income from properties sold; $0.05 per share of increase in interest income; and $0.04 per share of interest expense savings.\nNormalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that, by their nature, are not comparable from period to period, non-cash items, and items that tend to obscure the company’s operating performance. Definitions of FFO, Normalized FFO and reconciliations to net income, determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, are included at the end of this press release.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the company’s balance of cash and marketable securities was $3.1 billion.

The weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding when calculating FFO or Normalized FFO per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 124,734,221 shares, compared to 125,150,337 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSame property results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nThe company’s same property portfolio at the end of the quarter consisted of 13 properties totaling 6.3 million square feet, which excludes one held for sale property.

Same property NOI decreased 2.1% when compared to the same period in 2017. Same property cash NOI increased 4.3% when compared to the same period in 2017. The company entered into leases for approximately 117,000 square feet, including renewal leases for approximately 71,000 square feet and new leases for approximately 46,000 square feet. GAAP rental rates on new and renewal leases were 10.8% higher compared to prior GAAP rental rates for the same space.

We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, impairment of depreciable real estate, and our portion of these items related to equity investees and noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO because we exclude certain items that we view as nonrecurring or impacting comparability from period to period. FFO and Normalized FFO are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures. We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to EQC common shareholders, operating income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities. We believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to EQC common shareholders, operating income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to EQC common shareholders, operating income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.

NOI is income from our real estate operations including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. Cash Basis NOI is NOI excluding the effects of straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, and lease termination fees. The quarter-to-date same property versions of these measures include the results of properties continuously owned from January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018. The year-to-date same property versions of these measures include the results of properties continuously owned from January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018. Land parcels and properties classified as held for sale within our condensed consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the same property versions of these measures. We consider these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income (loss) because they help to understand the operations of our properties. We use these measures internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that they provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. Cash Basis NOI is among the factors considered with respect to acquisition, disposition and financing decisions. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to EQC common shareholders, operating income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to EQC common shareholders, operating income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate these measures differently than we do.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507006201/en/\nEquity Commonwealth\nSarah Byrnes, Investor Relations\n(312) 646-2801\nir@eqcre.com\nSource: Equity Commonwealth", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507006201/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eqcre.com&esheet=51802020&newsitemid=20180507006201&lan=en-US&anchor=www.eqcre.com&index=2&md5=9f6decbe527f1b97c171f3ec852fef6a", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eqcre.com&esheet=51802020&newsitemid=20180507006201&lan=en-US&anchor=www.eqcre.com&index=1&md5=9e91fff3a17f56ec448bfdaa1ea745d6", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eqcre.com&esheet=51802020&newsitemid=20180507006201&lan=en-US&anchor=www.eqcre.com&index=3&md5=07edced7494f92e8dd69962825b89f8e"], "published": "2018-05-08T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:32:17.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
