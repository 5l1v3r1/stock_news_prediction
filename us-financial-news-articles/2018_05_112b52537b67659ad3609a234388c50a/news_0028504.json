It offered 3.26 euros a share for EDP. It also offered 7.33 euros a share for EDP’s wind power unit, EDP Renovaveis, which is less than its closing price of 7.84 euros.\nEDP’s market capitalisation was nearly 11.4 billion euros as of Friday. The company serves nearly 10 million electricity market clients and 1.6 million natural gas customers and has over 330,000 km of power transmission lines.\nThe Portuguese government has no objections to the bid, Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters earlier.
