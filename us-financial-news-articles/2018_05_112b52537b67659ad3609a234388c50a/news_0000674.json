The majority procured hardware and software cybersecurity solutions from us, which we deployed and continue to manage and maintain.\n“This momentum has continued into 2018, as we strengthened our balance sheet with a $1.6 million capital raise to further accelerate our growth and our stock began trading on the OTC Markets. We also signed three new multi-year managed service contracts and expanded the managed services for an existing customer, increasing contract revenue by more than $800,000. This elevated our managed service customer base and revenue stream to record levels.\n“For the remainder of 2018, we see continued widespread growth in demand for cybersecurity managed services, with this accelerating the adoption of our superior service offerings. We also expect to enter new geographical markets, led by our growing sales, marketing and service organization that is 100% focused on customer experience and security. We believe this will keep us on track for another year of record growth and expansion.”\nAbout VirtualArmour\nVirtualArmour is a premier Managed Services Provider (MSP) delivering customizable management of advanced network and security services to global businesses across numerous industry sectors.
