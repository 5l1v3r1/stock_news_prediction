Margins would not be applied, with full payment required upfront, it said.\nThe move mirrors that of its U.S. rival CME Group Inc , which has launched cash-settled U.S. premium contracts for aluminium and copper in recent years.\nThe London Metal Exchange, the world’s oldest and largest metals marketplace, has said it also plans to introduce cash-settled regional aluminium premiums in the future.\nThe initiative also comes as China’s commodities derivatives exchanges have started opening up to foreign investors for the first time, part of an long-term effort to increase their influence over global prices of everything from oil to copper.\nIn March, Shanghai launched a crude oil contract, the first commodity derivatives futures market to be open to international investors. This month, Dalian Commodity Exchange took a similar step, giving foreign players access to its iron ore futures.\nIn the past decade, the Shanghai exchange has captured a greater share of global metals futures trading volumes from the LME as the country has grown into the world’s top consumer and producer of metals.\nTurnover has also boomed as China’s burgeoning middle class has developed an appetite for investing in financial markets.
