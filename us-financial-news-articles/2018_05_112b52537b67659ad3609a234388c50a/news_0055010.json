In doing so, the judge found that Grimm is covered by a federal law that bars discrimination in education. Grimm graduated from high school in June 2017.\nGrimm, 19, was born a girl and identifies as male. Grimm had sued the school board to win the right to use the public school’s boys’ bathroom. Grimm argued the school’s refusal violated a federal anti-discrimination law called Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.\nThe judge said the parties should schedule a settlement conference within 30 days.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:07:53.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
