REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya\nThe suspects who included the public service ministry’s principal secretary pleaded not guilty to magistrate Douglas Ogoti of charges that relate to stealing at the government’s National Youth Service (NYS).\nIt is rare for prosecutors to bring such a large group of public officials to court to answer corruption charges. President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to stamp out graft when he was first elected in 2013 but critics say he has been slow to pursue top officials and ministers.\nThe chief prosecutor Noordin Mohamed Haji on Monday named 54 people, 40 of them government officials, as due to face charges on counts including abuse of office and conspiracy to commit an economic crime. Some of those charged remained at large.

REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya\nThe NYS is the state agency that trains young people and deploys them to projects ranging from construction to traffic control.\nHaji said on Monday the investigation by his office and the police revealed that funds were stolen through fictitious invoices for goods such as firewood and stationery and multiple payments on one supplier invoice.

Earlier this year, a court acquitted nearly two dozen NYS officials after a trial over the alleged theft of 48 million Kenyan shillings ($470,000) in 2015.\nOn Tuesday, local human rights organisations said a woman who has been using social media to organise a demonstration on Thursday against corruption is missing.\nThe National Coalition of Human Rights Defenders said the woman had sent a text message on Tuesday morning to her lawyer saying that she had been detained by plainclothes men. Her phone was then switched off.\nThe police spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n($1 = 101.4000 Kenyan shillings) Reporting by Humphrey Malalo and Thomas Mukoya; Additional reporting by George Obulutsa; Writing by Maggie Fick and Aaron Maasho; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:24:09.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
