They were due to depart again late on Wednesday.\nUNHCR previously evacuated about 1,020 refugees and asylum seekers to Niger, but the process had been suspended from late February because of delays in resettling them in Western countries.\nSeveral hundred refugees have been resettled directly from Libya, but numbers have been limited because most Western embassies evacuated from Tripoli in 2014.\nAnother evacuation flight from Libya to Niger is planned for next week, said UNHCR official Omar Bugharsa.\nThere are hundreds of thousands of mainly sub-Saharan African migrants in Libya, some of whom traveled to the country hoping to cross to Europe by sea.\nMany experience dire conditions and abuse including forced labor and torture in Libya as they pass through the hands of smuggling networks and armed groups.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami; Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T13:29:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
