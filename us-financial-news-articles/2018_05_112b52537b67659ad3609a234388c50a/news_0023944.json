(Nasdaq:CEMI), a leader in point-of-care (\"POC\") diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter .\nRecent Accomplishments & Highlights\nAchieved total revenue of $7.7 million of which net product sales were $6.4 million for the first quarter 2018, increases of 22% and 18% respectively, over prior year. Increased production to initiate supply of HIV STAT-PAK® Assays to the Ethiopian Pharmaceuticals Fund and Supply Agency in the second quarter, following the previously announced three-year $15.8 million total contract award. Completed Phase 1 of the DPP® Assay to be developed through the AstraZeneca collaboration, to identify an “undisclosed” biomarker. Entered collaboration with LumiraDx to develop portfolio of new POC diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, which includes development funding, reagent purchases, and royalty payments from LumiraDx.\n“We started the year with continued execution in our core business, advancement of product development initiatives and progress on key technology collaborations, including those with AstraZeneca and LumiraDx,” said John Sperzel, Chembio’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our performance on all fronts is driving growth and creating momentum we look to build upon. We are increasingly confident in our ability to leverage our DPP® platform to derive significant value and believe we are in an advantageous position in the global point of care diagnostics market.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.7 million, an increase of 22% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net product sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $6.4 million, an increase of 18% compared to the first quarter of 2017. License and royalty and R&D, milestone and grant revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.3 million, an increase of 47% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nProduct gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.3 million, an increase of 3.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Product gross margin percent for the first quarter of 2018 was 35.6% compared to 40.7% for the first quarter of 2017. The lower product gross margin for the 2018 first quarter resulted primarily from an increased percentage of sales in markets with lower average selling prices.\nOther costs and expenses, representing R&D and SG&A expenses, for the first quarter of 2018 were $4.3 million, a decrease of 10.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017.
