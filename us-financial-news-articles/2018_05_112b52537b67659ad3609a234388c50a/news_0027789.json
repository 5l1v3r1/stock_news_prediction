(NYSE MKT:AST), a biotechnology company dedicated to developing cell-based therapeutics to treat neurological conditions associated with demyelination and cellular immunotherapies to treat cancer, today reported financial and operational results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as well as recent corporate progress.\n“Our partner, Cancer Research UK, recently achieved additional milestones with our cancer immunotherapy product candidate AST-VAC2,” commented Michael Mulroy, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The first clinical site for the first-in-human clinical trial of AST-VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has completed its site initiation visit and commenced the process to open enrollment following the release of the initial cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) grade lot of AST-VAC2. With this progress, Asterias is poised to have two of its cell-based therapies in active clinical development programs, which will be a significant milestone for the company.”\nMulroy continued, “We are also excited about the continued progress in our spinal cord injury clinical program. The results from the SCiStar study that we reported in February further support AST-OPC1’s positive safety profile and its potential to durably engraft and help restore upper extremity motor function improvement to individuals with severe cervical spinal cord injuries. We will be providing additional data readouts from the SCiStar study in 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019.”\n“On the corporate side, Asterias reduced its cash burn significantly in the first quarter, and we anticipate that the quarterly cash burn rate for the remainder of 2018 will be near or slightly below the first quarter burn rate,” said Ryan Chavez, Chief Financial Officer.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Key Achievements\nAST-VAC2:\nCancer Research UK released the first cGMP clinical grade lot of AST-VAC2. This lot will provide initial clinical trial material for subjects enrolling in the first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluating AST-VAC2 in NSCLC. This initial clinical trial, which is being sponsored and managed by Cancer Research UK, will examine the safety and tolerability of AST-VAC2 in NSCLC subjects as the study’s primary endpoints. Secondary and tertiary endpoints of the study include evaluations of the immunogenicity of AST-VAC2 in NSCLC subjects. The partnership between Asterias and Cancer Research UK is being conducted under Cancer Research UK’s Clinical Development Partnerships (CDP) scheme, which allows the first clinical trial of AST-VAC2 to be initiated without significant Asterias resources being allocated to the trial or the manufacturing of the product. On completion of the clinical trial, Asterias will have an exclusive first option to acquire the data from the trial. Initiated the process to open enrollment in the first site for the AST-VAC2 trial in NSCLC. The study will enroll up to 24 subjects into one of two cohorts, depending on the stage of each subject’s NSCLC.\nThe company anticipates the first subject in the NSCLC study being enrolled and dosed in the second quarter of 2018. AST-VAC2 is a platform cancer immunotherapy that could be investigated as a potential therapeutic for many cancer indications and for targeting of many antigens. The results from the Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by Cancer Research UK could be used to support advanced clinical studies in one or more of the following areas:\nNon-small cell lung cancer Other indications showing high levels of telomerase activity and susceptibility to immunotherapy In combination with check point or immune pathway inhibitors In combination with additional antigens, including those arising from the exciting new field of tumor\nAST-OPC1:\nIn February, Asterias reported additional results from the company’s ongoing Phase 1/2a SCiStar study that continued to support AST-OPC1’s positive safety profile and its potential to durably engraft and help restore upper extremity motor function improvement to individuals with severe cervical spinal cord injuries.\nThe company intends to report the following AST-OPC1 data readouts later this year:\nSix-month update for the entire SCiStar study, including Cohort 5, late in the second quarter or early third quarter of 2018. 12-month update for Cohorts 3 and 4 in the third quarter of 2018. 24-month update for Cohort 2 in the third or fourth quarter of 2018. 12-month update for the entire SCiStar study, including Cohort 5, late in the fourth quarter of 2018 or early in the first quarter of 2019.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities totaled $18.8 million as of March 31, 2018.\nTotal revenues were $0.5 million for the first quarter, which were comprised of license revenues and royalty revenues on product sales by licensees. Research and development expenses were $3.6 million in the first quarter, with the primary driver being expenses associated with the company’s AST-OPC1 program. General and administrative expenses were $1.9 million in the first quarter. Total operating expenses were $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss was $2.3 million, or $0.04 per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.13 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.

Asterias is presently focused on advancing three clinical-stage programs which have the potential to address areas of very high unmet medical need in the fields of neurology and oncology. AST-OPC1 (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) is currently in a Phase 1/2a dose escalation clinical trial in spinal cord injury. AST-VAC2 (antigen-presenting allogeneic dendritic cells) represents a second generation, allogeneic cancer immunotherapy that also targets telomerase presenting tumor cells. The company's research partner, Cancer Research UK, plans to begin a first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial of AST-VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer. AST-VAC1 (antigen-presenting autologous dendritic cells) is an autologous cancer immunotherapy targeting telomerase presenting tumor cells, with promising efficacy and safety data from a Phase 2 study in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) which the company believes is proof of concept data for AST-VAC2.
