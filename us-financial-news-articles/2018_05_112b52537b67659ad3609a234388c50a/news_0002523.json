It then accelerated toward Turkish shores and did not respond to subsequent radio calls from the Greek gunboat, according to the statement.\nThe Greek navy said NATO authorities had been informed, adding that there were no injuries or any serious damage to the ship. Turkey’s transport ministry later confirmed that there were no casualties on either side following the collision.\nThe Greek island of Lesbos, which lies close to Turkey, was on the frontline of a migration influx in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflict found sanctuary there. The number of arrivals has since eased considerably after an agreement between the European Union and Turkey to allow migrants to be sent back.\nReporting by Michele Kambas; Additional reporting by Tulay Karadeniz in Ankara; Editing by Nick Macfie and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T09:23:48.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
