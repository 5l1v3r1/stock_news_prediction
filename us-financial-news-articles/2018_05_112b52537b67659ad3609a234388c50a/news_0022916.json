The retired general vowed to quit before Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen \"talked him off a ledge,\" according to an Axios report in early April.\nOne former administration official told the AP that Kelly privately called Trump \"an idiot\" last year, which Kelly denied as \"total BS.\"\nKelly told NPR on Thursday he has \"a close relationship\" with Trump, noting that he spends about eight hours a day with the president.\n\"My view is to speak truth to power. I always give my opinion on everything. He always listens,\" Kelly said.\nListen to the full interview from NPR here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:43:49.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
