Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 Spain's Garbine Muguruza celebrates winning her first round match against Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\nThe third seed Muguruza, who lifted the Suzanne Lenglen Cup in 2016, prevailed 7-6(0) 6-2 in a rain-disrupted match against the 2009 champion, a clay court expert very few would like to take on so early in the tournament.\nAlthough she has been struggling to return to top form after undergoing wrist surgery last year, world number 43 Kuznetsova remains a formidable opponent.\nMuguruza stayed focused throughout, however, and her power, speed and poise made the difference.

It was a very good first round, and the fact that I won, although it was a very difficult match, it was a match against an expert. The last matches I have played, the results were difficult.
