Major health care players like, UnitedHealth , Aetna and Kaiser Permanente, are increasingly using virtual care or telehealth for primary care appointments and follow-ups.\nAnother option is \"virtual visit\" via a smartphone app.\nAmong startups offering on-demand health care is 98point6, a Seattle-based app that connects you with a doctor through text messaging.\n\"We've attempted to solve the primary care crisis. By 2020, there will be a 20K physician shortage. That will rise to 30,000 by 2025,\" 98point6 CEO and co-founder Robbie Cape told CNBC's \"On the Money\" in a recent interview.\nCape explained that when you jump into their service, which costs $20 the first year for unlimited visits, patients immediately enter into conversation with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\"We actually have board-certified physicians that are behind all of the artificial intelligence that we're doing. We're using artificial intelligence not to replace the doctors, but to actually augment the doctors,\" Cape said.\nIn non-emergency situations, a \"virtual visit\" with a physician using text and video on a smartphone, tablet or computer can be faster and cheaper than an in-person doctor's appointment.\nThe average primary care visit costs $160 , while the cost of a virtual visit is between $50 and $75. However, 98point6 offers unlimited virtual visits for the first year for $20 , with the second year fee checking in at $120.\nSomething for 'everyone'\nA recent Accenture poll found that 70 percent of consumers say they're interested in virtual healthcare. So far, however, only 20 percent have tried it.\nSo who does 98point6 consider as its target patient? \"Absolutely everyone,\" Cape responded, when asked by CNBC.\n\"If you have health care, this is still a more economical way for you to see primary care because the cost for the first year is $20 which is as much as your co-pay, if you have insurance,\" Cape said. \"For people who don't have any insurance, this is a phenomenal option and then for the people on HAS (Health Savings Accounts) who are on a high deductible plan, this is also great.\"\nThe platform launched on May 1 st and is now available to patients in 11 states. California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington and New Jersey.\nCurrently all of 98point6's doctors are based in the Seattle headquarters, but he said each physician is licensed to practice medicine in all 11 states where they currently operate.\nWhile he expects to be available in all 50 states by the end of the year, he said the company can be profitable now.\n\"We are capable of making money even at the rates we're charging today, because of how efficient we can make doctors with the AI,\" Cape said. \"Our board-certified physicians can see large number of patients with all the assistance we give them with technology.\"\nOn the Money airs on CNBC Saturday at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.", "external_links": ["https://www.98point6.com/", "https://www.aafp.org/news/blogs/inthetrenches/entry/patients_on_high_deductible_plans.html", "https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/virtual-care-moves-toward-the-frontline-of-provider-patient-relationships/516025/", "https://www.merritthawkins.com/news-and-insights/thought-leadership/survey/survey-of-physician-appointment-wait-times/"], "published": "2018-05-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T17:01:05.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
