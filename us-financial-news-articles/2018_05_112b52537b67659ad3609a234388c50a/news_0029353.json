Lots and lots of tremors,” said Cindy Conda, whose house lies just east of Leilani Estates where 27 homes have been torched by lava in the last eight days and whose residents have all been evacuated.

Slideshow (6 Images)\nToxic, orange clouds of sulfur dioxide gas have hampered utility repair work, but water supplies have been restored to many homes, said Keith Okamoto, manager and chief engineer at Hawaii County Department of Water Supply.\nWhile locals contend with lava and gas on the ground, explosions at Kilauea’s summit, some 25 miles (40 km) to the west are dusting downwind communities with ash that is an irritant to eyes and breathing.\nThe Hawaii Volcanoes National Park around the summit was closed to visitors on Thursday, given risks of the first explosive eruptions in nearly a century, which could launch refrigerator-sized “ballistic blocks” over half a mile (0.8 km) and send ash columns tens of thousands of feet into the atmosphere.\nResidents of Kona on the west of the island have complained of volcanic smog, or vog, from the large amounts of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants spewing from Kilauea. Further afield, people said it was “very voggy” on the streets of state capital Honolulu, around 210 miles (340 km) northwest of Kilauea on the island of Oahu.\n(For a graphic on 'Scorched earth' click tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS )\n(For a graphic on 'Hawaii's Kilauea volcano' click tmsnrt.rs/2rmXdVZ ) Reporting by Karin Stanton; additional reporting by Terray Sylvester in Pahoa; writing by Andrew Hay in New Mexico; editing by Bill Tarrant and Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:53:00.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
