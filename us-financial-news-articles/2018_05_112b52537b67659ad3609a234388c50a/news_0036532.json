Damien said he was taken to a police station overnight and questioned.\nDamien said he was asked to sign a pledge promising to cancel upcoming events and in return he would be released.\nThe Interior Ministry said it was unable to provide immediate comment.\nDamien said he was told that if he refused to sign the pledge, he would be referred to the investigation judge for interrogation on the basis of articles pertaining to the incitement to immorality and to the breach of public morality for coordinating the activities.\nOn legal advice, Damien signed the pledge, he said in the statement.\nLebanon’s laws prohibit “unnatural” sex, without giving further definition, which has been used to criminalize gay sex. Last year a Lebanese judge said that same-sex relations do not contradict laws of nature, a move welcomed by rights activists.\nDamien said the public prosecution had received an Arabic version of the Beirut Pride program that was “completely distorted, making Beirut Pride appear like events of debauchery and disrespect of general law, while using derogatory terms to refer to LGBT individuals.\nGhenwa Samhat, executive director of Lebanese LGBT rights organization Helem, said that many rights organizations in Lebanon experience such pressures.\n“These things are not new to us,” Samhat said.\nBut in the 20 years since the LGBT rights movement began in Lebanon, progress has been made.\n“People can express themselves in public places, there are placers friendly to LGBTQ+, where they face no problems,” she said.\nPositive media coverage surrounding Beirut Pride and activities for the annual International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia on May 17 can also be counted as an achievement, Samhat said.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T12:09:04.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
