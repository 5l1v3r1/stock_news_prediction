(David Maialetti/The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP) Photo: Associated Press\nThis is a weekly commentary by external experts.\nA woman died aboard Southwest Airlines Co. Flight 1380 on April 17 after an engine broke apart while the aircraft was more than 30,000 feet in the air, forcing the jet to make an emergency landing. It was the first U.S. airline accident fatality since 2009.\nInvestigators are trying to figure out what made the CFM56-7B engine break apart . U.S. and European aviation regulators concurrently imposed emergency inspection requirements for the type of engine that broke apart. The engine’s manufacturer released its own updated inspection guidance .\nSouthwest issued four statements on the day of the incident. The first announced the plane was being diverted; the second acknowledged an accident occurred and a passenger died. “The entire Southwest Airlines family is devastated and extends its deepest, heartfelt sympathy to the customers, employees, family members and loved ones affected by this tragic incident,” said the airline.\nThe third statement said the company was speeding up inspections of CFM56 engines; the fourth was a statement from the aircraft’s captain and first officer. Southwest followed with statements on engine inspections and how inspections impacted flights , including a video from Chief Executive Gary Kelly. Mr. Kelly wrote to passengers on the flight, offering a $5,000 check and a $1,000 travel voucher as “a tangible gesture of our heartfelt sincerity,” WSJ reported.\nThree crisis-management professionals review Southwest’s public statements and communications.\nJudy Phair, president, PhairAdvantage Communications: “Southwest Airlines has one important advantage as it deals with the greatest crisis in its history: Its good reputation with its flying public has built a bank of trust, buying [the public's] initial willingness to listen to its story. Continuing to deliver on that trust is critical.\n“Southwest had a well-developed crisis plan that it implemented swiftly as an in-air engine rupture was occurring. With the confirmation of its first passenger fatality ever, Mr. Kelly’s video apology conveyed emotion and compassion. Proper procedures were followed, regular updates were released, passengers received practical and financial support and communications continued. Within a few days Southwest announced that it would check engines in all its Boeing 737 jets in the coming week, even though it would cause some daily flight cancellations.\n“That announcement could have come earlier but overall Southwest’s response has exemplified good, effective crisis communication. It’s accepting responsibility and acting aggressively. It’s avoiding a blame game. Now the most difficult part begins: the after-crisis period. How it handles itself and its communications in the long run will be the real test of its ability to recover.\nTadd Schwartz, president and chief executive, Schwartz Media Strategies: “Southwest Airlines did many things right in the minutes, hours and days following the tragedy that struck Flight 1380. The company’s public response was prompt, its executives were visible and their outreach to passengers was compassionate and substantive. In the end, consumer confidence reigns supreme and Southwest could have done more to calm concerns about the safety of its planes, evidenced by reports of lost bookings in the weeks following the incident.\n“Announcing an accelerated engine inspection schedule was a reasonable first step in the days following the mid-air explosion, but it didn’t go far enough. Southwest should have declared that every one of its aircraft would be temporarily taken out of service for a top-to-bottom safety check extending far beyond engines, even if it meant incurring more operational headaches over a longer period. Undertaking a comprehensive inch-by-inch inspection of its fleet would have alleviated lingering safety concerns and might have helped to mitigate the airline’s onslaught of cancelled bookings.”\nMike Paul, Reputation Doctor: “I give Southwest Airlines a ‘B+’ for its handling of Flight 1380’s CFM56-7B engine explosion. Southwest did not manufacture [the engine] itself but it took full responsibility as a global corporate brand.\n“What impressed me in all of Southwest’s crisis communications were three things: speed in executing its crisis plan, immediately taking responsibility for all and immediately seeking to best help customers, employees and regulators. Just as important, they did so as though all are family, with deep understanding of the powerful tool of emotional intelligence in proper customer and employee relations in a crisis, [and did not] lead by legal first.\n“The current solution includes clear best practices, understanding of crisis communications with heavy emotional intelligence. This winning strategy is led by the board, CEO and entire C-suite, which is crucial, and ripples down to all employees. This ‘do-the-right-thing’ strategy results in clear brand differentiation versus other airlines.”\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@wsj.com , and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.\nShare this: crisis of the week engine Flight 1380 Southwest Airlines Previous The Morning Risk Report: U.S. Considers More Limits on Chinese Tech Firms Next Corruption Currents: Trump Asserts 'Absolute Immunity' in Emoluments Lawsuit ", "external_links": ["https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-de080387b716f7f68a21d1f86491d2a4-initial-statement-southwest-airlines-flight-1380", "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/southwest-airlines-ceo-apologies-after-emergency-landing-kills-one-person-1213220419652?mod=article_inline", "https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-f21e121764b4d6bab45a23caf5030472-flight-operations-update-for-week-of-april-23-2018", "https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-de080387b716f7f68a21d1f86496b4a9-southwest-flight-1380-statement-3-issued820-pm-ct", "https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-de080387b716f7f68a21d1f864a80552-update-on-engine-fan-blade-inspections", "https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-de080387b716f7f68a21d1f8649f9e1f-southwest-flight-1380-statement-4-issued-845-pm-ct", "https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-de080387b716f7f68a21d1f864938d7a-southwest-airlines-confirms-accident-our-hearts-are-with-those-affected", "https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-de080387b716f7f68a21d1f864bf38df-information-regarding-flight-operations"], "published": "2018-05-03T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T18:15:51.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
