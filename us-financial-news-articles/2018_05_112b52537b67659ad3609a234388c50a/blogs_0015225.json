Copper smelting would need more in investments and time to restart, he added.\nThe town of La Oroya where the smelter is located in Peru's central Andes was once named one of the 10 most polluted places in the world by the Blacksmith Institute environmental group. Hundreds of children in La Oroya have been found to have dangerous levels of lead in their blood.\nFormer President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned amid corruption allegations last month, relaxed sulfur dioxide emission limits to cut the cost of investing in upgrades in smelters. But six attempts to sell La Oroya in an auction failed to draw any offers.\n(Reporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T00:31:33.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
