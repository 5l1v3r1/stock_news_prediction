REUTERS/Essam al-Sudani He said Iranian oil sales could plunge by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd in the next six weeks as well, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision this month to withdraw from an international nuclear deal with Iran and revive sanctions that could limit crude exports from OPEC’s third-largest producer.\nRecord domestic oil output and exports have capped the rally in the United States, and led to a rising premium for Brent above WTI, which traded at $8.20 a barrel on Thursday, the widest spread since April 2015. <0#WTCLc1-LCOc1>\nU.S. crude output has soared 27 percent in the last two years to a record 10.72 million barrels per day, putting it within reach of top producer Russia’s 11 million bpd.\nThat has not been enough to stop oil prices rallying, energy ministers of OPEC’s largest producer Saudi Arabia and its neighbor and fellow OPEC member United Arab Emirates to note that the market remains well supplied.\nThe two ministers, in a joint statement, blamed volatility in prices on international political tensions. They plan to meet their Russian counterpart in Saint Petersburg in a week to discuss the oil market.\nGlobal oil inventories were expected to drop further as the peak demand summer driving season nears, offsetting increases in U.S. shale output, Bernstein analysts said.\nSeveral banks have in recent days raised their oil price forecasts, citing tighter supplies and strong demand.\nFurther supporting prices, Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) said it was halting crude exports from a major Nigerian pipeline.\nOn the flip side, high oil prices would hurt consumption, the International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday as it lowered its global oil demand growth forecast for 2018 to 1.4 million bpd from 1.5 million bpd. [EIA/S]\nThe IEA said global oil demand would average 99.2 million bpd in 2018. U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said consumption would cross 100 million bpd during the peak summer period.\nAdditional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore and Ron Bousso in London; editing by Simon Webb and Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T04:21:30.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
