REUTERS/Hannah McKay “The reason why letters of credit have persisted is because of two real challenges — the absence of digital infrastructure and the challenge of coordinating multiple parties,” Vivek Ramachandran, global head of innovation and growth at HSBC’s commercial banking unit told Reuters.\n“This platform helps us overcome the first and I think the technology and everyone focussed on it gives us the impetus to go after the second now with hopefully much better results than we have seen in the past.”\nRamachandran said HSBC already had another client lined up for the next similar transaction.\nBanks have invested millions in developing blockchain applications in a bid to cut costs and simplify back office processes, such as the settlement of securities trades.\nBlockchain uses a distributed ledger maintained by a network of computers to verify transactions, rather than a centralized system. The blockchain application used in the Cargill transaction is supported by 12 banks, which could help bring the technology to the market more broadly.\nHSBC said the transaction was executed on a platform called Corda, which was developed by R3, a New York-based blockchain consortium whose members include more than 100 banks, regulators and trade associations.\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T04:18:46.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
