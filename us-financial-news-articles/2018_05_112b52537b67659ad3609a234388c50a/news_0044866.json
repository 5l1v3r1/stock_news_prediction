Reduce number of parliamentarians in the lower house to 400 lawmakers from 630, and in the upper house to 200 from 315. A ban on lawmakers from changing parliamentary groups once elected\n- An “ethical code” banning convicted criminals, even if their sentences are still under appeal, Freemasons, or those under investigation for serious crimes, including corruption, from entering government\n- Abolish National Council for Work and the Economy (CNEL)\n- Offer more autonomy and funding to the regions\nReporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:21:33.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
