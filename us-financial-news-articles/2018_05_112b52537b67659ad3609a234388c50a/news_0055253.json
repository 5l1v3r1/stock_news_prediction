Jerrold Nadler’s first battle with Donald Trump came in the 1990s, when the future president sought federal money for a project that would have benefited one of his developments on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Mr. Nadler, a New York Democrat, opposed the subsidies and had them stripped from congressional spending bills.\nThe feud soon degenerated into acrimony and name-calling. Mr. Trump called Mr. Nadler dumb and suggested he lose weight. A spokesman for Mr. Nadler fired back: “If Mr. Trump thinks Mr. Nadler is so dumb, we would ask why Nadler never went bankrupt and had to spend his father’s fortune to keep his family’s business afloat.”\nMessrs. Trump and Nadler may go a few more rounds. Though the election is more than five months away, many political analysts say Mr. Trump’s unpopularity and a surge of enthusiasm among Democrats give the Democrats a good chance at taking control of the House. That would place Mr. Nadler, a fixture of New York City politics since the late 1960s, in line to take the chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee.\nFrom that perch, the 70-year-old Democrat would conduct oversight over federal law enforcement and the U.S. Department of Justice and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. The Judiciary Committee also has the power to subpoena the Trump administration, including the White House, for documents and testimony.\nMr. Nadler has vowed that under his stewardship, the Judiciary Committee will protect the integrity of the special counsel inquiry that has already netted guilty pleas from a number of Mr. Trump’s associates on financial crimes and charges of lying to the FBI.\n\"I can promise you that if Democrats win and I’m the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, this is not an issue that we will ignore or hide away,” Mr. Nadler said at a recent town hall.\nThe White House didn’t respond to a request for comment on Mr. Nadler’s potential ascent to the Judiciary chairmanship.\nCapitol Hill Republicans warn a Democratic House majority would launch endless investigations into the Trump administration. After winning control of the House in 2010, Republicans began aggressive oversight investigations into the Obama administration and essentially ground President Barack Obama’s legislative agenda to a halt.\nRep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), a close ally of Mr. Trump, said that Congress has done its job of investigating the Trump administration as needed. But he believes Democrats would be “more aggressive as it relates to this president.”\nMany Republicans on Capitol Hill privately believe that Democrats will be under significant pressure from their supporters to initiate impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.\nA handful of Democrats in the House have already drafted articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, though Democratic leaders have warned candidates and lawmakers that talk of impeachment undermines the serious nature of the proceedings and only energizes Republican voters.\nMr. Trump has denied any cooperation with Moscow and called the continuing investigation a “witch hunt,” while the president’s Republican allies on Capitol Hill have conducted aggressive probes of law enforcement’s actions during the 2016 campaign.\nMr. Nadler has opposed calls for impeachment, voting against a procedural motion that would have opened an impeachment inquiry late last year. He had a front-row seat as a junior member of the committee during the 1998 Clinton impeachment.\n“I think the biggest lesson that he learned is that you don’t impeach a president unless there’s an actual crime,” said Brett Heimov, who served as Mr. Nadler’s chief of staff for 12 years. “You’ve got to take this very seriously. It can’t be a political exercise.”\nWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:49:18.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
