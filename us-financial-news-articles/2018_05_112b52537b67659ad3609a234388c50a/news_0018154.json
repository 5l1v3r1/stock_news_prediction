Charitable giving at the time of one's death can often be an intentional shaping of that story â€” a way for people to still tell their own narrative after they are gone and shape what is remembered by others as having been important to them.\nA bequest is a gift that is made through a person's will or living trust that takes effect on that person's death. This is the most common way that people make a gift to charity at the time of their death and has been the traditional way of making a legacy gift for many years. If your grandparents or parents made a large legacy gift to charity, it was probably done through a bequest.\nBequests are an important part of nonprofit fundraising and can serve the legacy planning purposes of the donor very well.

It allows a way for donors to communicate their ethics and values to their heirs, as well as leave them a community improved by philanthropy.\nMore from Fixed Income Strategies:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T15:40:52.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
