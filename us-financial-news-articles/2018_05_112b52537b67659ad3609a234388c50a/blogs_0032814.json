Photo: Reuters\nU.S. authorities and financial industry regulators penalized the New York-based brokerage unit of a large Chinese bank for failures in its anti-money laundering compliance program, imposing millions in fines.\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China Financial Services LLC, or ICBCFS, cleared and settled billions of penny-stock shares without a sufficient compliance program, according to findings from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the self-regulator Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The brokerage, a unit of China’s biggest lender, had cleared the transactions on behalf of Chardan Capital Markets LLC, which dealt directly with clients.\nNeither filed reports on potentially suspicious transactions despite red flags.\nFinra fined ICBCFS $5.3 million and ordered it to retain an independent compliance consultant. The brokerage also agreed to pay the SEC $860,000 without admitting or denying the commission’s findings.\nICBCFS had failed to make changes to its anti-money-laundering program despite a notice in June 2014 from the SEC about its customers engaging in risky penny-stock trading that it had failed to detect, Finra alleged.\nA representative of ICBCFS didn’t immediately return a request for comment. Its lawyer had no immediate comment.\nThe SEC also settled with Chardan Capital Markets, which agreed to pay a $1 million penalty. Chardan’s anti-money laundering officer, Jerard Basmagy, agreed to pay $15,000. Chardan’s attorney said the brokerage cooperated with the SEC’s investigation. “We’re certainly pleased to have successfully resolved this matter,” a lawyer for Mr. Basmagy said.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
