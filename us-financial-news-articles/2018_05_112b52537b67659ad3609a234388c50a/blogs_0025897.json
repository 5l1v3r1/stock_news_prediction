All those that started as a regional manufacturing base are now expanding even further to North Africa, Southeast Asia, East Africa and exporting out of Bahrain. It's great for us as it creates employment, it creates investment, it creates export value and it links us to our neighboring countries.\"\nBahrain is only a short journey away from most of the major capitals in the Gulf, Al Zayani noted. \"By air and by road we're only four hours away from Riyadh, four hours away from Kuwait and we have an excellent logistics network.\"\nSpeaking to CNBC from Bahrain's Gateway Gulf Investment Forum in Manama on Thursday, the minister said the inaugural event had been a success.\n\"We set out to launch Bahrain as an investment hub, and we've had an excellent presence from our neighboring countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait specifically, and huge interest from the rest of the world.
