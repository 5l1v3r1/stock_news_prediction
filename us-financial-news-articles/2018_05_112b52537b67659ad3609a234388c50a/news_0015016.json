Capacity growth would also now come in at 2.5-3.5 percent, versus previous plans for 3-4 percent growth.\n“What I regret is that the year started well in commercial terms, demand was there,” Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey told journalists.\n$1 = 0.8344 euros Reporting by Victoria Bryan and Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:06:52.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
