Both the police and prosecutors denied it.\nThe spokeswoman said video images showed someone had fired a shot into the ground just after 1700 CET (1500 GMT). The area was cordoned off and no one was injured.\nThe bullet shells have been recovered and sent to the lab for ballistic checks while the police are looking for the suspect, she said.
