NPEs include non-performing loans (NPLs) - credit past due for more than 90 days - plus restructured loans likely to turn non-performing again.\nCredit-loss provisions fell to 167 million euros from 206 million in the fourth quarter. Non-performing exposures dropped to 41.8 percent of its book from 42.5 percent at the end of 2017.\nThe bank’s net interest income fell 4.8 percent quarter-on-quarter to 355 million euros, while commission and fee income dropped 8.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.\nInternational operations remained profitable with net profit before discontinued operations rising to 33 million euros from 27 million euros in the same quarter a year earlier.\nEurobank has said it will maintain its Balkan footprint in Bulgaria, Serbia and Cyprus after pulling out of Romania.
