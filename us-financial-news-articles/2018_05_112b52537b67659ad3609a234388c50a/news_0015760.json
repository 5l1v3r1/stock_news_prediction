Football - Soccerex Global Convention - Manchester - 9/9/14 Shaun Harvey - CEO of the Football League speaks during the Soccerex Global Convention Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Andrew Boyers Livepic\nThe FA confirmed last month that negotiations were ongoing to sell the national stadium to U.S. billionaire Shahid Khan, with British media saying the deal could be worth up to 1 billion pounds.\nHarvey believes that the money from the potential sale would help boost clubs in the EFL, which governs the second-tier Championship and two lower tiers League One and League Two along with several cup competitions.\n“Under the current distribution mechanism the professional game is entitled to 50 percent of the proceeds after central costs have been met,” Harvey told the Times.\n“...

Also, it’s the home of England and those assurances are really important,” Khan told reporters on Tuesday.\n“My team will be asking the FA those sorts of questions...” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T08:12:24.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
