We can’t keep waiting. This is the last call,” Coparmex said in a statement.\nPena Nieto took office in December 2012 promising to get a grip on gang violence and lawlessness. After some initial progress, the situation deteriorated and killings hit their highest level on record last year.\nThe president’s office had no immediate response to a request for comment.\nPena Nieto is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election, and the prospects of his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) retaining power look grim. PRI candidate Jose Antonio Meade has been running third in nearly all opinion polls.\nThe principal beneficiary has been leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has built up a strong poll lead on the back of widespread disenchantment with the PRI over corruption and rising violence, as well as sluggish economic growth.\nBut Lopez Obrador has also faced criticism for floating a possible amnesty for criminals to restore order.\nIn a thinly veiled jab at Lopez Obrador, the CCE said: “While it is true that violence is not solved by violence, it is also true that crime is not ended by forgiveness or calls to Mass.” (Reporting by Anthony Esposito and Sharay Angulo; Additional reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; Editing by Dave Graham and Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:42:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
