REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman/File Photo Abbas’ surgery coincided with an escalation in Israeli-Palestinian tensions after Israeli troops shot dead dozens of Palestinian protesters on the Gaza border on Monday as the new U.S. Embassy opened in Jerusalem.\nAbbas waved to reporters and walked unaided to his car but did not speak. Palestine TV said the procedure was carried out on the Palestinian leader’s middle ear.\nIn February, Abbas was hospitalized in the United States for medical checks during a trip to address the U.N. Security Council in New York.\nIn October 2016, he was taken to hospital in the West Bank without prior public announcement for heart function tests which, a doctor said, showed normal results.\nAbbas became Palestinian president after the death in 2004 of Yasser Arafat. He pursued U.S.-led peace talks with Israel but the negotiations broke down in 2014.\nHe is also chairman of the Executive Committee of the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization, a position to which he was re-elected unopposed on May 4.\nReporting by Ali Sawafta; Writing by Maayan Lubell and Ori Lewis, Editing by Gareth Jones and Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:24:37.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
