They are going to want to be back in the market.”\n“Technology, industrials, energy, financials, consumer discretionary are going to benefit today. You may include areas of the market that are involved in trade with China, I think that’s what’s going to help.”\nThe cooling of tensions, though, elicited mixed reactions from U.S. business leaders, with some happy to see the trade spat easing while others said it would be difficult for Washington to rebuild momentum to address what they see as troubling Chinese policies.\nAt 8:46 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 216 points, or 0.87 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 15.25 points, or 0.56 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 51.5 points, or 0.75 percent.\nAll 29 of the 30 Dow components trading premarket were higher. Shares of Boeing, which sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers, were up 2.1 percent.\nHeavy equipment makers Caterpillar and Deere gained more than 2 percent.\nThe biggest Dow gainer was General Electric, which rose 2.9 percent after the company said it would merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec in a $11.1 billion deal.\nChipmakers, whose major clients include Chinese companies that often build the U.S. chips into devices sold back to Americans, also posted broad gains. Intel was up 1.2 percent and Micron surged 4.7 percent.\nShares of regional bank MB Financial jumped 14.5 percent after Fifth Third Bancorp said it would buy the smaller rival in a $4.7 billion deal. Shares of Fifth Third fell 5.7 percent.\nLaSalle Hotel Properties gained after PE firm Blackstone said it would buy the U.S. hotel owner for $3.7 billion.\nIn other deals, data firm HIS Markit said it would buy smaller rival Ipreo from funds of BlackStone and Goldman Sachs for $1.86 billion, while power company NextEra agreed to pay $5.08 billion for some Southern Co assets.
