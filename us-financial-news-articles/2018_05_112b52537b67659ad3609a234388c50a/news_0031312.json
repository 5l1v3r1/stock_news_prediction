REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe departures leave Ashok Vardhan as the unit’s sole chief. A source Goldman has no immediate plans to appoint new division heads.\nEalet joined the bank as a commodities trader in 1991. Salame joined in 1996 and became co-head of the securities group in 2008.\nEalet and Salame were occasionally touted as potential CEO candidates for the bank. But after a long-running succession race resulted in Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein highlighting David Solomon as his choice, their future appeared less certain.\nGoldman has been overhauling its trading business, which includes equities trading and fixed income, after one of its worst years on record.\nBlankfein as well as other top executives have told investors that the bank is looking to increase trading revenue by leveraging the relationships investment bankers already have with corporate clients.\nGoldman shares were up 1 percent at $245.50.
