Ireland CDS hit their highest in eight months at 33 bps.\nCDS of euro zone banks - which have major exposure to Italian sovereign holdings - also rose sharply. Readings on Italian banks UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo both hit 156 bps - rising 34 bps and 32 bps from Monday respectively - to their highest in more than a year.\nAccording to figures published by Citi on Monday, the top six Italian banks have a 166.6 billion euros exposure to Italian sovereign debt.\nMajor French banks’ BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale 5-year CDS also rose sharply, jumping 50 bps or more on the day. BNP Paribas hit 93 bps - its highest since April 2017.
