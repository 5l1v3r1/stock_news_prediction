Subsiding geopolitical tensions, including around a U.S.-China trade spat, have provided further dollar support.\n“The key U.S. dollar driver has been the divergence between economic data in the U.S. and the rest of the world, and U.S. data continues to look comparatively robust,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.\nWhile markets don’t expect a change in rates from the Fed at the conclusion of its meeting, investors will be watching for any change in language.\nBond markets are expecting roughly three rate hikes until the end of the year and the focus will be on whether the Fed drops any cautionary comments on the inflation outlook.\nWith the dollar rallying, there were several casualties on Tuesday. The Swedish crown fell more than 1.3 percent to 8.8575 crowns per dollar, a fresh one-year low, and lost 0.9 percent to hit 10.655 crowns versus the euro, its lowest since 2009.\nThe Swedish currency is one of the worst performing major currencies in 2018 as investors bet the Riksbank will be one of the last central banks to rein in its stimulus.\nSterling also skidded more than half a percent to below $1.37, although most of the move was down to more weaker-than-expected British economic news.\nThe dollar rose 0.3 percent to 109.70 yen, its highest since Feb 8.\nThe New Zealand and Australian dollars also dropped against the dollar, the Australian currency to $0.7505, its weakest since Dec. 11.\nEditing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-05-01T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T16:18:32.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
