SIMILAR COMPETITIONS\nEuropean soccer body UEFA and its counterpart for North and Central America and the Caribbean, CONCACAF, have already set up Nations League contests in their own continents.\nIn both cases, the competitions involve all the national teams in their respective regions who are divided into divisions based on their rankings.\nThere is promotion and relegation between the divisions, as in conventional domestic club leagues. UEFA’s inaugural competition will begin in September this year. Other continents would have to set up similar competitions for the tournament to be viable.\nInfantino suggested that similar intercontinental mini-tournaments to the Final 8 could also be organised for the top teams in the lower divisions.\nInfantino’s letter said that all revenue from the competition would be redistributed.\n“This means that FIFA as an organisation would not benefit financially from this competition,” he said.\n“We believe this offer is an excellent opportunity for the confederations and member associations as well as for football in general.”\nIn a separate proposal for Europe, the letter suggested that member associations could receive up to $50 million for taking part in a single UEFA Nations League campaign although this amount would only be for the top-five ranking federations.\nThe next biggest five European countries would receive $15 million to $20 million while the 33 lowest-ranked associations would receive a more modest $7 million.
