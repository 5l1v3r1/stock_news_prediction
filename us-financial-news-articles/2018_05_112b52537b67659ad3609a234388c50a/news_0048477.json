That said, in buy-to-let, it still boasts a notably robust pipeline,” Investec analysts said in a note.\n“However, with Paragon shares already at a 10-year high ... we think it may struggle to make any further material near-term progress from here,” said Investec, which rates the stock a ‘hold’.\nThe pipeline for new buy-to-let lending rose to 787.6 million pounds, up 6.1 percent from a year earlier.\nCommercial lending volume rose 49 percent in the first half to 269.3 million pounds, while mortgage lending increased nearly 23 percent to 721 million pounds.\nThe company raised its outlook for commercial lending for the full year to over 600 million pounds from a prior estimate of 500 million pounds on expectations of strong lending volumes throughout the year.\nMortgage volumes for the year are expected to be over 1.6 billion pounds, the company said.\nThe company’s pre-tax profit rose to 77.2 million pounds from 69.4 million pounds a year ago.\nParagon, founded in 1985 and with more than 12 billion pounds of assets under management, is one of a slew of new or niche banks that are bidding to poach market share from Lloyds , RBS, Barclays and HSBC which dominate British retail banking.
