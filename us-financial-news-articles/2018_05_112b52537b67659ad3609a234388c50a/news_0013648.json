There are also a number of long-standing borrowers that have kept up-to-date with their mortgage repayments but are unable to get a new deal; we want to explore ways that we, and the industry, can help them.”\nThe report found little evidence that current commercial arragements between firms in the market are harming customers.\nThe watchdog recommends making it easier for customers to identify the right mortgages and best brokers at an early stage.\nThe FCA intends to work with the sector to develop metrics to help consumers to compare brokers, the FCA said.
