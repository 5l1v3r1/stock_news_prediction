(\" Medicure \" or the \" Company \") (TSXV:MPH, OTC:MCUJF), a cardiovascular pharmaceutical company, is pleased to announce that the TSX Venture Exchange (\" TSXV \") has accepted the Company's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\" NCIB \").\nUnder the terms of the NCIB, Medicure may acquire up to an aggregate of 794,088 common shares. In the opinion of the Company, its common shares have been trading at prices that do not reflect its underlying value. Accordingly, Medicure believes that purchasing its common shares for cancellation, at present pricing, represents an opportunity to enhance value for its shareholders.\nAs of May 17, 2018, the Company had 15,881,760 common shares outstanding, of which 7,445,612 common shares represent the public float of Medicure. Under TSXV policies, Medicure is entitled to purchase up to the maximum of 794,088 common shares, representing 5% of the common shares outstanding, over the 12 month period that the NCIB is in place.\nThe NCIB will commence on May 28, 2018 and will end on May 27, 2019, or on such earlier date as Medicure may complete its maximum purchases under the NCIB. The actual number of common shares which will be purchased, if any, and the timing of such purchases will be determined by the Company. All common shares purchased by the Company will be purchased on the open market through the facilities of TSXV by PI Financial Corp. (\" PI \") acting on behalf of the Company in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and will be surrendered by the Company to its transfer agent for cancellation. The prices that the Company will pay for common shares purchased will be the market price of the shares at the time of purchase.\nThe Company also announces that it has entered into an automatic share purchase plan with PI (the \" Plan \") in order to facilitate repurchases of its common shares under the NCIB. Under the Plan, PI may purchase common shares under the NCIB at times when the Company would ordinarily not be permitted to do so, due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods.\nPurchases under the Plan will be made by PI based upon parameters prescribed by the TSXV, applicable Canadian securities laws and terms of the Plan.\nAbout Medicure\nMedicure is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for the U.S. cardiovascular market. The primary focus of the Company is the marketing and distribution of AGGRASTAT Â® (tirofiban hydrochloride) injection and ZYPITAMAG TM (pitavastatin) tablets in the United States, where they are sold through the Company's U.S. subsidiary, Medicure Pharma, Inc.
