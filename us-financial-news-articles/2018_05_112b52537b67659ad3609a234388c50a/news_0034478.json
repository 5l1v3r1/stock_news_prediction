There would be incremental restructuring costs of A$300 million ($226.4 million), at the top of the guidance.\nThe National Broadband Network was essentially a re-nationalisation of the fixed-access last mile of infrastructure from Telstra, CEO Andrew Penn said.\nThis had made Telstra a reseller of broadband services with the other operators.\n“In the last 12 months alone we have moved from three big players in mobile and fixed to a situation today where we face a 4th network operator entrant in mobile, an increasing number of mobile virtual-network operators and more than 170 resellers of fixed,” Penn said in a statement.\nThe National Broadband Network is usurping Telstra’s status as the country’s monopoly telecoms wholesaler, and will replace Telstra’s copper lines with fibre-optic by about 2021.
