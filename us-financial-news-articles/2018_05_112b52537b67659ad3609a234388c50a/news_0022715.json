Japan's Nikkei went the other way as a firmer yen trimmed 0.4 percent off the index.\nFriday's U.S. jobs report showed unemployment dropping to a new cycle low of 3.9 percent yet wages remained benign, suggesting the Federal Reserve would keep raising rates but at a gradual pace.\nThat outlook cheered Wall Street where the Dow ended Friday up 1.39 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 1.28 percent and the Nasdaq 1.71 percent.\nApple Inc hit a record high after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed that it had raised its stake in the iPhone maker.\nThe recent run of solid U.S. economic news contrasts with a softer turn in European data and lifted the dollar to its highest for the year so far against the euro.\nThe single currency was last at $1.1973, having been down as deep as $1.1911 on Friday. The dollar also reached its highest since December against a basket of currencies and was last trading at 92.463.\nIt had less luck against the Japanese yen, in part because strains in emerging market currencies were supporting safe havens such as the yen. The dollar eased off to 108.89 , having topped out around 110.05 last week.\n\"It's this recovery in the U.S. dollar one based on the data flow in the U.S. against the rest of the world which is catching many by surprise and causing ructions across emerging markets,\" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader.\nMarkets from Argentina to Turkey have been under intense pressure, in part because many of these countries have large amounts of U.S. dollar debt which gets more expensive to finance as the currency rises.\nA firming U.S. dollar has also been negative for some commodities, with gold falling for a third straight week before bouncing slightly on Monday to $1,318.16 an ounce.\n(Editing by Sam Holmes & Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T06:16:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
