Included in DAS revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was a one-time benefit of $4.3 million related to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the new revenue recognition standard.\nMilitary revenue of $15.9 million increased 26.4% compared to $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $(3.2) million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(6.9) million, or $(0.18) per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $21.9 million, an increase of 77.1% compared to $12.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined below and is reconciled to net loss attributable to common stockholders, the most comparable measure under GAAP, in the schedule entitled “Reconciliation of Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA.”\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $17.3 million, a decrease of 32.4% compared to $25.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFree cash flow was a negative $(3.8) million, compared to $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined below and is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable measure under GAAP, in the schedule entitled \"Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flows.\"\nBusiness Highlights\nThe Company entered into agreements with Tier 1 carriers representing 61 carrier contracts. The Company now has agreements with at least one Tier 1 carrier to be the anchor carrier customer at 53 of the 84 venues in backlog.\nThe Company added three new venue locations during the quarter.

The subscriber penetration rate improved from 39.4% at December 31, 2017 to 42.3%.\nManagement Commentary\n“After a record setting 2017, our strong results and momentum continued with our streak of double-digit revenue growth extending to 14 consecutive quarters,” commented David Hagan, Chief Executive Officer of Boingo Wireless. “Our first quarter revenue was up over 31% year-over-year to $58.2 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and was driven by ongoing strength in carrier offload, DAS, and military. In addition, adjusted EBITDA exceeded our guidance, growing 77% year-over-year to $21.9 million. The first quarter marked our 11 th consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion.”\nMr. Hagan continued, “Carrier sales took a major leap forward as we entered into agreements with multiple Tier 1 carriers representing 61 carrier contracts, which provide us with at least one Tier 1 carrier as the anchor customer at 53 of our 84 venues locations in backlog. In addition, we were pleased to have made additional traction with carrier offload with a record number of connects during the quarter fueled by the rollout of offload services to the majority of our domestic military bases and airport venue locations. The military vertical was also strong with the addition of 6,000 beds and 12,000 subscribers during the quarter driving record subscriber penetration of 42.3%.”\nBusiness Outlook\nBoingo Wireless is initiating guidance for the second quarter ending June 30, 2018 and is reiterating guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2018, as follows:\nSecond Quarter 2018\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $54.0 million to $58.0 million.

Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $17.5 million to $20.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined below and is reconciled to net loss attributable to common stockholders, the most comparable measure under GAAP, in the schedule entitled “Reconciliation of Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA – Guidance.”\nFull Year 2018\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $227.0 million to $234.0 million. Net loss attributable to common stockholders is expected to be in the range of $(20.0) million to $(15.0) million, or a net loss of $(0.48) to $(0.36) per diluted share.

The supplement and webcast will be archived online upon completion of the conference call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Boingo Wireless’ financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Boingo Wireless provides Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental measures of its performance.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, interest and other expense (income), net, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are nonrecurring, infrequent, or unusual. Boingo Wireless believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating its operating performance. Boingo's management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and other operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of the Company's performance for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies and to communicate with its board of directors concerning its financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative financial measure to net loss attributable to common stockholders, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. Boingo Wireless believes that free cash flow provides investors with additional useful information to measure operating liquidity because it reflects the amount of cash generated by the Company's operations after the purchases of property and equipment that can be used for strategic opportunities. Free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nRevenue Recognition Changes\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition . A reconciliation of the changes for the first quarter of 2018 is set forth in the schedule entitled “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.” The Company's second quarter and full year 2018 guidance is based on the new standard.\nAbout Boingo Wireless\nBoingo Wireless, Inc.

This measure is an indicator of the reach of the Company’s DAS network. This metric represents the number of DAS nodes under contract but not yet active as of the end of the period. This metric represents the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end. This metric shows how often individuals connect to the Company’s global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include retail and wholesale customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where Boingo is a paid service provider or receives revenue sponsorship or promotion fees.
