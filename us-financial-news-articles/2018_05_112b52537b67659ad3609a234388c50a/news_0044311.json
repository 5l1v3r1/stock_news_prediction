Microchip intends to use a combination of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and borrowings under a new term loan facility to fund the cash consideration and other amounts payable in respect of its previously announced acquisition of Microsemi Corporation (the “Microsemi Merger”). It is expected that the net proceeds of the offering will be deposited in escrow, with such net proceeds to be released to finance the consummation of the acquisition of Microsemi Corporation, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. There can be no assurance that the proposed offering of the Notes will be completed.\nThe Notes will be guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Company and its subsidiaries (including, following consummation of the Microsemi Merger, Microsemi Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries) that guarantee obligations under the Company’s revolving credit facility.\nThe Notes will be sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and outside the United States only to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
