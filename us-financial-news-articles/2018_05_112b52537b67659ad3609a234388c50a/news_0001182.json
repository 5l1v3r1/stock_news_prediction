Among its premium wine portfolio are well-established brands such as Nederburg.\nGlobal wine output fell to its lowest level in 60 years in 2017 due to poor weather conditions in the European Union that slashed production in the bloc, international wine organisation OIV said.\nSouth Africa, which is the eight largest wine producer in the world, was seen producing 10.8 million hectolitres in 2017, up three percent from the previous year, the OIV said in April.\n“What is evident is that South African wine grape growers and producers need to accelerate efforts to adapt to conditions of the drought. This is the new normal,” Groenewald said.
