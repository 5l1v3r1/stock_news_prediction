These items include a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment that increased pre-tax earnings by $103.8 million, a $71.7 million reduction to RINs costs as a result of our Cheyenne refinery's small refinery exemptions for the 2015 and 2017 calendar years and a charge of $3.6 million for integration costs related to our 2017 Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc. (\"PCLI\") acquisition.\nExcluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $137.3 million ($0.77 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $33.4 million ($(0.19) per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2017, which excludes an inventory valuation adjustment, PCLI acquisition and integration costs, incremental cost of products sold attributable to our PCLI inventory value step-up, a gain on foreign currency swap contracts that fixed the USD/CAD conversion rate on our PCLI purchase price and a loss on early extinguishment of debt. Collectively, these items decreased prior year earnings by $12.0 million. Adjusted for these items, net income increased $170.7 million compared to the same period of 2017 due to higher sales volumes and margins in our refining business as well as a full quarter contribution from our PCLI acquisition. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $320.3 million compared to $307.7 million for the first quarter of last year.\nHollyFrontier’s President & CEO, George Damiris, commented, “HollyFrontier's strong financial results reflect our ability to capitalize on the refining margins and crude spreads available during the first quarter. To date, crude spreads have been consistent, and we are optimistic about refining and lubricant margins going into the summer.”\nWithin the refining segment, crude oil charges averaged 415,260 barrels per day (“BPD”) for the current quarter compared to 371,070 BPD for the first quarter 2017. On a per barrel basis, consolidated refinery gross margin was $12.83 per produced barrel, a 70% increase compared to $7.54 for the first quarter of 2017.\nOur Lubes and Specialty Products segment reported EBITDA of $41.7 million, driven by strong Rack Forward sales volumes and margins. Rack Forward EBITDA was $56.0 million for the quarter and HollyFrontier continues to expect Rack Forward EBITDA in the $180.0 million to $200.0 million range for 2018.\nHolly Energy Partners, L.P. (\"HEP\") reported EBITDA of $88.5 million for the first quarter compared to $70.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. This growth was driven by the acquisition of the SLC and Frontier Pipelines as well as volume growth in HEP’s Permian crude gathering system. Distributable cash flow came in at $69.1 million, delivering a distribution coverage ratio of 1.04x.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net cash provided by operations totaled $333.8 million, an increase of $373.2 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. During the period, we declared and paid a dividend of $0.33 per share to shareholders totaling $58.9 million and spent $25.2 million in stock repurchases. At March 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $781.5 million, a $150.7 million increase over cash and cash equivalents of $630.8 million at December 31, 2017. Additionally, our consolidated debt was $2,382.9 million. Our debt, exclusive of HEP debt, which is nonrecourse to HollyFrontier, was $991.9 million at March 31, 2018.\nThe Company has scheduled a webcast conference call for today, May 2, 2018, at 8:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss first quarter financial results. This webcast may be accessed at: https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1188768&tp_key=8a9159666f .

Accordingly, our Tulsa refineries' lubricants operations, previously reported in the Refining segment, are now combined with the operations of our Petro-Canada Lubricants business (acquired February 1, 2017) and reported in the Lubricants and Specialty Products segment. Segment information for the three months ended March 31, 2017 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation.\nOur operations are organized into three reportable segments, Refining, Lubricants and Specialty Products and HEP. Our operations that are not included in the Refining, Lubricants and Specialty Products and HEP segments are included in Corporate and Other. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements and are included in Eliminations. Corporate and Other and Eliminations are aggregated and presented under Corporate, Other and Eliminations column. The Refining segment includes the operations of our El Dorado, Tulsa, Navajo, Cheyenne and Woods Cross refineries and HFC Asphalt (aggregated as a reportable segment). Refining activities involve the purchase and refining of crude oil and wholesale and branded marketing of refined products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. These petroleum products are primarily marketed in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. HFC Asphalt operates various terminals in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nThe Lubricants and Specialty Products segment involves PCLI's production operations, located in Mississauga, Ontario, that include lubricant products such as base oils, white oils, specialty products and finished lubricants and the operations of our Petro-Canada Lubricants business that includes the marketing of products to both retail and wholesale outlets through a global sales network with locations in Canada, the United States, Europe and China. Additionally, the Lubricants and Specialty Products segment includes specialty lubricant products produced at our Tulsa Refineries that are marketed throughout North America and are distributed in Central and South America.\nThe HEP segment involves all of the operations of HEP, a consolidated variable interest entity, which owns and operates logistics assets consisting of petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery process units in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. The HEP segment also includes a 75% interest in UNEV Pipeline, LLC (an HEP consolidated subsidiary), and a 50% ownership interest in each of Osage Pipeline Company, LLC and Cheyenne Pipeline LLC. Revenues from the HEP segment are earned through transactions with unaffiliated parties for pipeline transportation, rental and terminalling operations as well as revenues relating to pipeline transportation services provided for our refining operations. Due to certain basis differences, our reported amounts for the HEP segment may not agree to amounts reported in HEP's periodic public filings.\nRefining Lubricants\nand Specialty\nProducts\nHEP Corporate,\nOther and\nEliminations\nConsolidated\nTotal\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Sales and other revenues: Revenues from external customers $ 3,655,867 $ 444,840 $ 27,457 $ 263 $ 4,128,427 Intersegment revenues $ 93,318 $ — $ 101,427 $ (194,745 ) $ — $ 3,749,185 $ 444,840 $ 128,884 $ (194,482 ) $ 4,128,427 Cost of products sold (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory) $ 3,211,704 $ 307,531 $ — $ (172,110 ) $ 3,347,125 Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment $ (103,838 ) $ — $ — $ — $ (103,838 ) Operating expenses $ 238,484 $ 64,908 $ 36,203 $ (19,307 ) $ 320,288 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 26,371 $ 30,654 $ 3,122 $ 4,517 $ 64,664 Depreciation and amortization $ 67,175 $ 8,864 $ 25,141 $ 3,161 $ 104,341 Income (loss) from operations $ 309,289 $ 32,883 $ 64,418 $ (10,743 ) $ 395,847 Earnings of equity method investments $ — $ — $ 1,279 $ — $ 1,279 Capital expenditures $ 42,774 $ 8,538 $ 12,612 $ 5,615 $ 69,539 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Sales and other revenues: Revenues from external customers $ 2,742,747 $ 321,269 $ 16,609 $ (142 ) $ 3,080,483 Intersegment revenues $ 79,888 $ — $ 89,025 $ (168,913 ) $ — $ 2,822,635 $ 321,269 $ 105,634 $ (169,055 ) $ 3,080,483 Cost of products sold (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory) $ 2,559,155 $ 230,781 $ — $ (148,760 ) $ 2,641,176 Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment $ 11,531 $ 292 $ — $ — $ 11,823 Operating expenses $ 254,370 $ 39,319 $ 32,552 $ (18,516 ) $ 307,725 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 22,368 $ 13,320 $ 2,637 $ 18,930 $ 57,255 Depreciation and amortization $ 69,438 $ 5,304 $ 18,373 $ 2,925 $ 96,040 Income (loss) from operations $ (94,227 ) $ 32,253 $ 52,072 $ (23,634 ) $ (33,536 ) Earnings of equity method investments $ — $ — $ 1,840 $ — $ 1,840 Capital expenditures $ 47,434 $ 1,835 $ 8,265 $ 2,223 $ 59,757 March 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,703 $ 118,926 $ 8,565 $ 647,273 $ 781,467 Total assets $ 6,830,385 $ 1,445,978 $ 2,173,063 $ 462,648 $ 10,912,074 Long-term debt $ — $ — $ 1,390,952 $ 991,922 $ 2,382,874 December 31, 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,488 $ 41,756 $ 7,776 $ 573,737 $ 630,757 Total assets $ 6,474,666 $ 1,610,472 $ 2,191,984 $ 415,032 $ 10,692,154 Long-term debt $ — $ — $ 1,507,308 $ 991,685 $ 2,498,993 Refining Segment Operating Data\nThe following tables set forth information, including non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) performance measures about our refinery operations. Refinery gross and net operating margins do not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments and depreciation and amortization. Reconciliations to amounts reported under GAAP are provided under “Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” below.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we revised the following refining segment operating data computations: refinery gross margin; net operating margin; and operating expenses to better align with similar measurements provided by other companies in our industry and to facilitate comparison of our refining performance relative to our peers. Effective with this change, these measurements are now inclusive of all refining segment activities including HFC Asphalt operations and revenues and costs related to products purchased for resale and excess crude oil sales. Refining segment operating data for the three months ended March 31, 2017 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current presentation.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Mid-Continent Region (El Dorado and Tulsa Refineries) Crude charge (BPD) (1) 227,690 221,890 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 246,070 242,120 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 253,080 228,540 Refinery utilization (4) 87.6 % 85.3 % Average per produced barrel (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 10.65 $ 6.01 Refinery operating expenses (7) 5.14 6.17 Net operating margin $ 5.51 $ (0.16 ) Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 5.28 $ 5.82 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 43 % 58 % Sour crude oil 30 % 19 % Heavy sour crude oil 20 % 15 % Other feedstocks and blends 7 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 55 % 50 % Diesel fuels 30 % 30 % Jet fuels 5 % 9 % Fuel oil 1 % 1 % Asphalt 3 % 3 % Base oils 4 % 5 % LPG and other 2 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Southwest Region (Navajo Refinery) Crude charge (BPD) (1) 106,110 74,470 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 116,560 79,490 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 122,260 78,870 Refinery utilization (4) 106.1 % 74.5 % Average per produced barrel (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 9.85 $ 9.03 Refinery operating expenses (7) 4.00 7.41 Net operating margin $ 5.85 $ 1.62 Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 4.19 $ 7.36 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 31 % 18 % Sour crude oil 60 % 76 % Other feedstocks and blends 9 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 54 % 51 % Diesel fuels 38 % 38 % Fuel oil 2 % 4 % Asphalt 3 % 4 % LPG and other 3 % 3 % Total 100 % 100 % Rocky Mountain Region (Cheyenne and Woods Cross Refineries) Crude charge (BPD) (1) 81,460 74,710 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 89,420 83,750 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 90,180 81,030 Refinery utilization (4) 84.0 % 77.0 % Average per produced barrel (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 22.98 $ 10.40 Refinery operating expenses (7) 9.54 10.20 Net operating margin $ 13.44 $ 0.20 Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 9.62 $ 9.87 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 33 % 38 % Heavy sour crude oil 37 % 31 % Black wax crude oil 21 % 20 % Other feedstocks and blends 9 % 11 % Total 100 % 100 % Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 56 % 58 % Diesel fuels 34 % 33 % Fuel oil 3 % 2 % Asphalt 3 % 5 % LPG and other 4 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % Consolidated Crude charge (BPD) (1) 415,260 371,070 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 452,050 405,360 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 465,520 388,440 Refinery utilization (4) 90.9 % 81.2 % Average per produced barrel (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 12.83 $ 7.54 Refinery operating expenses (7) 5.69 7.28 Net operating margin $ 7.14 $ 0.26 Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 5.86 $ 6.97 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 38 % 46 % Sour crude oil 32 % 26 % Heavy sour crude oil 18 % 15 % Black wax crude oil 4 % 4 % Other feedstocks and blends 8 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % Consolidated Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 55 % 52 % Diesel fuels 33 % 32 % Jet fuels 3 % 5 % Fuel oil 1 % 2 % Asphalt 3 % 4 % Base oils 2 % 3 % LPG and other 3 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % (1) Crude charge represents the barrels per day of crude oil processed at our refineries.

Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\nReconciliations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA excluding special items (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in financial statements.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to as EBITDA, is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax provision, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus (i) lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments (ii) our RINs cost reduction related to our Cheyenne Refinery small refinery exemptions (iii) PCLI acquisition and integration costs (iv) loss on early extinguishment of debt (v) incremental cost of products sold attributable to our PCLI inventory value step-up and (vi) gain on foreign currency swap contracts.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculations provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; however, the amounts included in these calculations are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These are presented here because they are widely used financial indicators used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants.\nSet forth below is our calculation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders $ 268,091 $ (45,468 ) Add interest expense 32,723 27,158 Subtract interest income (2,590 ) (819 ) Add (subtract) income tax provision (benefit) 85,037 (16,789 ) Add depreciation and amortization 104,341 96,040 EBITDA $ 487,602 $ 60,122 Add (subtract) lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment (103,838 ) 11,823 Subtract RINs cost reduction (71,704 ) — Add PCLI acquisition and integration costs 3,595 15,597 Add loss on early extinguishment of debt — 12,225 Add incremental cost of products sold attributable to PCLI inventory value step-up — 10,238 Subtract gain on foreign currency swap contracts — (24,545 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 315,655 $ 85,460 EBITDA attributable to our Lubricants and Specialty Products segment is set forth below.\nRack Back Rack Forward Total Lubricants\nand Specialty\nProducts\n(In thousands) Three months ended March 31, 2018 Income (loss) from operations (1) $ (19,840 ) $ 52,723 $ 32,883 Add depreciation and amortization 5,628 3,236 8,864 EBITDA $ (14,212 ) $ 55,959 $ 41,747 Three months ended March 31, 2017 Income (loss) from operations (1) $ (9,646 ) $ 41,899 $ 32,253 Add depreciation and amortization 3,799 1,505 5,304 EBITDA $ (5,847 ) $ 43,404 $ 37,557 (1) Income (loss) from operations of our Lubricants and Specialty Products segment represents income (loss) plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income and (ii) income tax provision. Reconciliations of refinery operating information (non-GAAP performance measures) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements.\nRefinery gross margin and net operating margin are non-GAAP performance measures that are used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry. We believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis. Refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold is total refining segment revenues less total refining segment cost of products sold, exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, divided by sales volumes of produced refined products sold. Net operating margin per barrel sold is the difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per produced barrel sold. These two margins do not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments or depreciation and amortization. Each of these component performance measures can be reconciled directly to our consolidated statements of income. Other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same manner.\nBelow are reconciliations to our consolidated statements of income for refinery net operating and gross margin and operating expenses, in each case averaged per produced barrel sold. Due to rounding of reported numbers, some amounts may not calculate exactly.\nReconciliation of average refining segment net operating margin per produced barrel sold to refinery gross margin to total sales and other revenues\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands, except per barrel amounts) Consolidated Net operating margin per produced barrel sold $ 7.14 $ 0.26 Add average refinery operating expenses per produced barrel sold 5.69 7.28 Refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold 12.83 7.54 Times produced barrels sold (BPD) 465,520 388,440 Times number of days in period 90 90 Refining segment gross margin 537,536 263,595 Subtract rounding (55 ) (115 ) Total refining segment gross margin 537,481 263,480 Add refining segment cost of products sold 3,211,704 2,559,155 Refining segment sales and other revenues 3,749,185 2,822,635 Add lubricants and specialty products segment sales and other revenues 444,840 321,269 Add HEP segment sales and other revenues 128,884 105,634 Subtract corporate, other and eliminations (194,482 ) (169,055 ) Sales and other revenues $ 4,128,427 $ 3,080,483 Reconciliation of average refining segment operating expenses per produced barrel sold to total operating expenses\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands, except per barrel amounts) Consolidated Average operating expenses per produced barrel sold $ 5.69 $ 7.28 Times produced barrels sold (BPD) 465,520 388,440 Times number of days in period 90 90 Refining segment operating expenses 238,393 254,506 Add (subtract) rounding 91 (136 ) Total refining segment operating expenses 238,484 254,370 Add lubricants and specialty products segment operating expenses 64,908 39,319 Add HEP segment operating expenses 36,203 32,552 Subtract corporate, other and eliminations (19,307 ) (18,516 ) Operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 320,288 $ 307,725 Reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, RINs cost reductions, PCLI acquisition and integration costs, incremental costs of products sold due to PCLI inventory value step-up, gain of foreign currency swap contracts and loss on early extinguishment of debt.
