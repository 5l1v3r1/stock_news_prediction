His Sairoon electoral list captured 54 parliamentary seats, 12 more than Abadi’s.\n“Our door is open to anyone as long as they want to build the nation, and that it be an Iraqi decision,” Sadr said.\nIraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr (L) speaks during a news conference with Iraqi prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Baghdad, Iraq May 20, 2018. Iraqi Prime Minister Media Office/Handout via REUTERS A bloc led by Hadi al-Amiri, one of the most powerful figures in Iraq, came in second. Amiri, who leads an umbrella of paramilitary groups, has maintained close ties with Iran for decades.\nBefore the election, Tehran publicly stated it would not allow Sadr’s bloc to govern close ally Iraq, with which it shares a border. Iran has influenced the choice for prime minister in the past.\nWinning the largest number of seats does not automatically guarantee that Sadr will be able to hand-pick a prime minister.\nParties will have to align themselves to try and form a bloc large enough for the parliamentary majority necessary to nominate a candidate. The government should be formed within 90 days of the official results, but negotiations are expected to drag on for months.\nIraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr meets with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Baghdad, Iraq May 20, 2018. Iraqi Prime Minister Media Office/Handout via REUTERS The election dealt a blow to Abadi, but he could still emerge as a compromise candidate palatable to all sides because he has managed the competing interests of the United States and Iran - unwitting allies in the war against Islamic State - during his term in office.\nIn recent days, Sadr also met with Ammar al-Hakim, whose Hikma Movement trailed in seventh place, as well as with ambassadors from Iraq’s neighboring countries including Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s main rival in the Middle East.\nReporting by Raya Jalabi; Editing by Michael Georgy and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-20T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T10:58:53.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
