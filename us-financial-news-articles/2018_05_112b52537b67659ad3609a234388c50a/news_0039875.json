(NYSE: CHGG), a Smarter Way to Student, announced today that it has acquired WriteLab, Inc. (\"WriteLab\"), an AI-enhanced writing platform that teaches students grammar, sentence structure, writing style, and offers instant feedback to help students revise, edit, and improve their written work. This acquisition will strengthen Chegg's existing writing service, with the addition of new tools, features, and functionality.\n\"Nearly 75% of high school seniors are deficient in writing competencies i ,\" said Nathan Schultz, Chief Learning Officer at Chegg. \"Developing strong writing skills is essential for students while in school, and as they move into the workforce. WriteLab's technology will enrich our existing writing service and their team brings deep linguistic expertise to Chegg.\"\nChegg acquired WriteLab for approximately $15 million, in an all cash transaction. An additional payment of $5 million may be paid to key employees over the next three years, in cash or stock at Chegg's sole discretion, contingent upon the continued employment of such key employees.\nWriting deficiencies continue to be a challenge at all levels of education, impacting people well in to their careers.\n40% of high school students who took the ACT writing exam in 2016 lacked the reading and writing skills necessary to successfully complete a college-level English composition class. ii In a recent analysis, which analyzed millions of job postings, writing was the third overall most important baseline skill across all job occupations, behind organizational and communication skills. iii A recent survey by the AACU showed that only 27% of employers think that recent college graduates are well prepared in the area of written communication. iv\nWriteLab analyzes writers' drafts and not only offers revisions and edits, but also poses questions and suggestions, encouraging students to learn by making decisions about what they want to say and how they want to say it.\n\"We created WriteLab to empower students to write with confidence,\" said Matthew Ramirez, CEO and Co-Founder of WriteLab. \"By becoming a part of the Chegg family, who shares our student-first mission, we will reach more students and accelerate our work to support learners all around the world.\"\nAs a result of this acquisition, Chegg does not expect any material effect on operations, Q2 guidance, or full year 2018 guidance issued on April 26, 2018.\nAbout Chegg\nChegg puts students first. As the leading student-first connected learning platform, Chegg strives to improve the overall return on investment in education by helping students learn more in less time and at a lower cost.
