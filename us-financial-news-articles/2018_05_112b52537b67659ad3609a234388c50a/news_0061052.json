Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\nIt’s the Capitals’ first time in the finals in two decades.\nLeonsis surprised employees of his company, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, based on their ties to the team and their seniority, sending an email with a subject line “Let’s go to Vegas,” according to The Washington Post.\nHe also arranged for the selected employees to be housed at the Excalibur hotel and casino.\n“It’s truly amazing and out of this world,” one employee, Omar Castro, a guest relations manager, told the Post.\n“I never expected an owner of the company to do this. We get to share in this with them. ... He’s thinking of us as part of a family, as part of the experience. There’s no reason for him to do it. All I can say is a big thanks to Ted and his family for the opportunity, and for truly making this into something memorable for all of us here in the company.”\nThe employees who were on hand for Game 1 left disappointed, as the Capitals fell 6-4.\nGame 2 is Wednesday night.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T23:28:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
