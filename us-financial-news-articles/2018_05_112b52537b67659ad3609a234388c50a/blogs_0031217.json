Of course, they're spending a lot of cash. They're building factories.\"\n\"You have to expect when you're doing something entirely different than what anyone has done before\" not everything is going to happen on time, added Baron.\nTesla represented 1.62 percent of Baron Capital's assets under management as of March 31. Tesla, with a market value of nearly $52 billion, has seen its shares fall more than 6 percent during the past three months.\nInvestors have been concerned in part over the company's ability to ramp up production of the Model 3. Investors were also puzzled by Tesla chief Elon Musk performance during the company's first-quarter earnings call earlier this month. Musk cut off questioners on the call, and at one point dismissed what he called a \"boring, bonehead\" question from a key analyst.\nMusk has acknowledged that it was \"foolish\" of him to snub analysts.\nAlthough Musk has insisted the company neither needs nor wants new funding, many believe Tesla will seek to raise more capital this year.\nBaron said he doesn't expect Musk will come back to the market for more money unless \"he wants to grow as fast as he hopes.\"\n\"The capital he's going to need to produce new vehicles is much less than other companies are going to be spending and they'll be using less labor,\" he added.\nBaron, who has been investing in Tesla since 2014, said many investors buy and sell stocks on the basis of news. But Baron said his firm has made billions of dollars by doing extensive research, buying shares of what he feels are undervalued companies.\nIf an investor waits until something is successful then, \"it's too late. Then you're going to pay a high price,\" said Baron, whose firm has more than $27 billion assets under management. \"What we try to do is buy when that development is taking place.\"\nâ€”Reuters contributed to this report.
