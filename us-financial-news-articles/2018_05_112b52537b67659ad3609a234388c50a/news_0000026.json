First quarter 2018 revenues included $6.4 million of incremental revenues due to the full quarter impact of Huron's acquisition of Innosight, which was completed in March 2017, as well as revenues from the company's acquisition of the international assets of ADI Strategies, which was completed in April 2017 and has since been fully integrated into the Business Advisory segment.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income from continuing operations of $5.2 million for the same period last year.

Adjusted net income from continuing operations (5) was $4.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $11.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nThe average number of full-time billable consultants (1) increased 8.2% to 2,126 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 1,965 in the same quarter last year. Full-time billable consultant utilization rate (2) was 73.7% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 73.9% during the same period last year. Average billing rate per hour for full-time billable consultants (3) was $198 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $216 for the first quarter of 2017. The average number of full-time equivalent professionals (4) was 264 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 276 for the same period in 2017.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nHuron’s results reflect a portfolio of service offerings focused on helping clients address complex business challenges.\nThe company’s first quarter 2018 revenues by operating segment as a percentage of total company revenues are as follows: Healthcare (46%); Business Advisory (29%); and Education (25%). Financial results by segment are included in the attached schedules and in Huron's forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOUTLOOK FOR 2018 (6)\nBased on currently available information, the company affirmed guidance for full year 2018 revenues before reimbursable expenses in a range of $720.0 million to $760.0 million. The company also anticipates net income in a range of $23.0 million to $29.5 million, and both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $86.5 million to $98.5 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected in a range of $1.05 to $1.35, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected in a range of $2.10 to $2.40.\nManagement will provide a more detailed discussion of its outlook during the company’s earnings conference call webcast.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 WEBCAST\nThe company will host a webcast to discuss its financial results today, May 1, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (4:00 p.m. Central Time). The conference call is being webcast by NASDAQ and can be accessed at Huron's website at http://ir.huronconsultinggroup.com . A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the webcast and for 90 days thereafter.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (5)\nIn evaluating the company’s financial performance and outlook, management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are non-GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing their business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nABOUT HURON\nHuron is a global consultancy that helps its clients drive growth, enhance performance and sustain leadership in the markets they serve.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing the company's business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results.

These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. (6) As the company reported a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding equals the basic weighted average shares outstanding for that period. The non-GAAP adjustments described above resulted in adjusted net income from continuing operations for those periods. Therefore, dilutive common stock equivalents have been included in the calculation of adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding. HURON CONSULTING GROUP INC.
