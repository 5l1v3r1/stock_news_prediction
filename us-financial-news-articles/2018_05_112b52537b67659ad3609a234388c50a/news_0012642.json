(NYSE:LSI) a leading national owner and operator of self storage facilities, reported operating results for the 2018.\nThe Company achieved net income attributable to common shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 of $33.9 million or $0.73 per fully diluted common share. This compares to net income attributable to common shareholders of $20.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, or $0.44 per fully diluted common share.\nFunds from operations (“FFO”) (1) for the quarter were $1.27 per fully diluted common share compared to $1.26 for the same period last year. Absent $1.1 million of costs related to changes to the Company’s Board of Directors and other proxy matters in the first quarter of 2018, adjusted FFO per fully diluted common share was $1.30 and $1.26 for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\"We're pleased with the first quarter in that we achieved better than expected results in most of our markets, and, with record high occupancies and solid demand, are well positioned as we enter the upcoming busy season,\" commented CEO David Rogers. \"We're also encouraged with the continued ramp up of Life Storage Solutions, our third-party management division, as we grow our client base and expand our brand.\"\nHighlights for the 1 st Quarter Included:\nIncreased same store revenue by 2.5% and same store net operating income (\"NOI\") (2) by 2.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Grew same store average occupancy for the quarter by 150 basis points to 91.1% compared to the same period in 2017. The Company ended the quarter at 91.2% occupied, an all-time high for the first quarter, and 110 basis points higher than the same period in 2017. Reduced internet marketing expense 18% by leveraging improved search engine visibility. Added 105 mature stores owned since December 31, 2016 to its same store pool, including all stabilized facilities acquired during the 2016 LifeStorage acquisition. Added 10 stores to its third-party management platform; the Company now manages a total of 145 properties through its joint venture and third-party management agreements. Achieved adjusted funds from operations per fully diluted common share of $1.30, a 3.2% increase over the same period last year. Increased management fee income by 31.7% over that of the first quarter of 2017. Paid a quarterly dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock.\nOPERATIONS:\nTotal revenues increased 3.7% over first quarter 2017 while operating costs increased 3.7%, resulting in an NOI increase of 3.7%.\nRevenues for the 535 stabilized stores wholly owned by the Company since December 31, 2016 increased 2.5% from those of the first quarter of 2017, the result of a 150 basis point increase in average occupancy and a 6% increase in revenues related to tenant insurance.\nSame store operating expenses increased 2.6% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period. Increased real estate taxes, payroll and benefits, and utilities were partially offset by an 18% decrease in internet marketing costs. Consequently, same store NOI for the period increased 2.5% over the first quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.6 million over the same period in 2017. Absent $1.1 million of expenses associated with changes to the Company’s Board of Directors and other proxy-related matters in 2018, and $0.7 million incurred for the Company’s change of name in 2017, general and administrative costs would have been essentially flat year over year.\nThe Company achieved same store revenue growth in 25 of the 33 major markets in its same store pool, with 27 markets maintaining an average quarterly occupancy greater than 90%. Markets with the strongest positive revenue impact included Las Vegas, NV; Houston/Beaumont, TX; California (Northern and Southern); Buffalo-Upstate New York; and Boston, MA.\nPROPERTIES:\nDuring the quarter, the Company added 10 properties to its third-party management platform. It now manages a total of 145 properties through its joint venture and third-party management agreements. It has an additional 26 properties under contract to manage commencing in 2018 and 2019, three of which opened subsequent to quarter end. Twenty-one of the remaining 23 contracts are new developments.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had no properties under contract to purchase for its own portfolio or that of its joint ventures but expects to contribute up to $50 million to new or existing joint ventures during 2018.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY:\nIllustrated below are key financial ratios at March 31, 2018:\nDebt to Enterprise Value (at $83.52/share) 31.2% Debt to Book Cost of Storage Facilities 40.8% Debt to Recurring Annualized EBITDA 5.7x Debt Service Coverage 4.6x\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $7.8 million of cash on hand, and $370 million available on its line of credit.\nCOMMON STOCK DIVIDEND:\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.00 per share or $4.00 annualized.\nYEAR 2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE:\nThe following assumptions covering operations have been utilized in formulating guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018:\nSame Store\nProjected Increases Over 2017\n2Q 2018\nFY 2018\nRevenue 2.25 – 3.25% 1.75 – 2.75% Operating Costs (excluding property taxes) 1.25 – 2.25% 1.00 – 2.00% Property Taxes 5.50 – 6.50%\n5.50 – 6.50%\nTotal Operating Expenses 2.75 – 3.75% 2.50 – 3.50% Net Operating Income 2.00 – 3.00% 1.25 – 2.25% The Company’s 2018 same store pool consists of the 535 stabilized stores owned since December 31, 2016, which includes the stabilized legacy LifeStorage locations. The stores purchased between 2015 and 2017 at certificate of occupancy or that were in the early stages of lease-up are not included, regardless of their current occupancies. The Company believes that occupancy levels achieved during the lease-up period, using discounted rates, are not truly indicative of a new store’s performance, and therefore do not result in a meaningful year-over-year comparison in future years. The Company will include such stores in its same store pool in the first year after the stores achieve 80% sustained occupancy using market rates and incentives. Accordingly, three certificate of occupancy facilities constructed in 2014 that have achieved stabilized occupancy and rates have been added to the 2018 same store pool.\nThe Company plans to complete $50 – $55 million of expansions in 2018. It also has budgeted $20 - $23 million to provide for recurring capitalized expenditures including roofing, paving, and office renovations.\nThe Company has not included any acquisition activity for 2018. Should any acquisitions or joint venture investments occur, they are expected to be funded by free cash flow and draws on its line of credit which carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.10%.\nIn 2018, the Company anticipates entering into additional joint ventures, or adding to its existing agreements, contributing up to $50 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company operated 22 self storage facilities that it acquired between 2015 - 2017 upon issuance of certificate of occupancy or in the early stages of lease-up. These properties are expected to contribute above average revenue growth in 2018.\nAnnual general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $44 – $45 million.\nAs a result of the above assumptions, management expects adjusted funds from operations for the full year 2018 to be approximately $5.36 to $5.43 per share, and between $1.32 and $1.36 per share for the second quarter of 2018.\nReconciliation of Guidance 2Q 2018\nRange or Value\nFY 2018\nRange or Value\nEarnings per share attributable to\ncommon shareholders - diluted\n$ 0.77 - $ 0.81\n$ 3.12 - $ 3.19\nPlus: real estate depreciation and\namortization\n0.55 - 0.55\n2.24 - 2.24\nFFO per share $ 1.32 - $ 1.36 $ 5.36 - $ 5.43\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nWhen used within this news release, the words “intends,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify “forward looking statements” within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Company’s ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Company’s existing business and operations; the Company’s ability to enter new markets where it has little or no operational experience; the Company’s existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Company’s outstanding floating rate debt; the Company’s ability to comply with debt covenants; the future ratings on the Company’s debt instruments; the regional concentration of the Company’s business may subject it to economic downturns in the states of Florida and Texas; the Company’s ability to effectively compete in the industries in which it does business; the Company’s reliance on its call center; the Company’s cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes which may change the taxability of future income.\nCONFERENCE CALL:\nLife Storage will hold its First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018.

FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. Funds from operations is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus impairment of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. (2) Net operating income or \"NOI\" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that we define as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income: interest expense, impairment and casualty losses, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition related costs, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income: income from discontinued operations, interest income, gain on sale of real estate, and equity in income of joint ventures. We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure to investors in evaluating our operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. Additionally, NOI is widely used in the real estate industry and the self storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending on accounting methods and book value of assets. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net income. (3) Includes the stores owned and/or managed by the Company for the entire periods presented that are consolidated in our financial statements. Does not include unconsolidated joint ventures or other stores managed by the Company. (4) Does not include unconsolidated joint venture stores or other stores managed by the Company. (5) Other administrative expenses include office rent, travel expense, investor relations and miscellaneous other expenses.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006558/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nLife Storage, Inc.\nDiane Piegza, 716-633-1850\ndpiegza@lifestorage.com\nSource: Life Storage, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifestorage.com%2F&esheet=51799840&newsitemid=20180502006558&lan=en-US&anchor=Life+Storage%2C+Inc.&index=3&md5=c485d5389359755ae0729e971f2a3177", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fservices.incommconferencing.com%2FDiamondPassRegistration%2Fregister%3FconfirmationNumber%3D13678755%26linkSecurityString%3D3610d3b8f&esheet=51799840&newsitemid=20180502006558&lan=en-US&anchor=this+link&index=1&md5=0cd18d19812a159f98e4fb965e40cfc7", "http://invest.lifestorage.com/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvest.lifestorage.com%2F&esheet=51799840&newsitemid=20180502006558&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvest.lifestorage.com%2F&index=4&md5=8ee743bab821ea32380b03c55cd61c0b", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifestorage.com%2F&esheet=51799840&newsitemid=20180502006558&lan=en-US&anchor=lifestorage.com&index=2&md5=e979ac97536145bb56f71d5c5f2a19ec", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006558/en/"], "published": "2018-05-03T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T02:36:44.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
