(NYSE: MRC), the largest global distributor, based on sales, of pipe, valves and fittings and related products and services to the energy industry, today announced first quarter 2018 results.\nThe company's sales were $1.010 billion for 2018, which were 17% higher than 2017 and 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. All end-markets experienced growth in both comparative periods.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for 2018 was $12 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $0 million, or $0.00 per diluted share for 2017.\nAndrew R. Lane, MRC Global's president and chief executive officer stated, \"The year has started strong with revenue of $1.01 billion in the first quarter resulting in growth of 17% over the first quarter last year and 12% growth over the fourth quarter of 2017. This is the first quarter in the past ten that revenue has been over $1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was also strong at $59 million, or 5.8% of sales, in the first quarter. With the macroeconomic conditions across all our end-markets improving, our solid customer contract position and the first‑class execution our team delivers, we expect our performance to show continued strength in 2018.\"\n\"We continued to take advantage of the markets to return cash to shareholders by repurchasing $30 million of our stock in the first quarter and an additional $20 million in April to complete our $100 million authorization,\" Mr. Lane added.\nMRC Global's first quarter 2018 gross profit was $169 million, or 16.7% of sales, an increase from first quarter 2017 gross profit of $140 million, or 16.2% of sales. Gross profit for 2018 and 2017 reflect an expense of $7 million and $1 million, respectively, in cost of sales relating to the use of the last-in, first out (LIFO) method of inventory cost accounting.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $138 million, or 13.7% of sales, for 2018 compared to $126 million, or 14.6% of sales, for the same period of 2017. While total SG&A costs increased due to higher wages and benefits, increased activity levels and foreign exchange rate movements, SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined due to continued growth in the business.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $59 million in 2018 compared to $36 million for the same period in 2017. Please refer to the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) to net income (a GAAP measure) in this release.\nThe effective tax rate in 2018 and 2017 was 28% and 14%, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 relative to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% is primarily a result of pre-tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions with no corresponding tax benefit. The effective tax rate in 2017 relative to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% was driven by a discrete tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard.\nSales by Segment\nU.S. sales in 2018 were $806 million, up $140 million, or 21%, from the same quarter in 2017. All end-markets experienced strong growth with downstream leading, primarily driven by deliveries related to a large ongoing project in Pennsylvania, followed by midstream, driven by an increase in gathering line work, multiple transmission projects and gas utility activity, and finally, upstream, where higher well completion counts, and customer activity drove the increase.\nCanadian sales in 2018 were $78 million, up $1 million, or 1%, from the same quarter in 2017 as improvements in the midstream and downstream businesses were partially offset by lower upstream revenue driven by a lower rig count. A stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of approximately $3 million.\nInternational sales in 2018 were $126 million, up $7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to upstream project activity in Kazakhstan partially offset by non-recurring midstream pipeline project sales in Australia. Stronger foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of approximately $11 million.\nSales by Sector\nUpstream sales in 2018 increased 23% over 2017 to $302 million, or 30% of total sales. The increase in upstream sales was primarily in our U.S. segment as a result of increased customer activity and in our international segment as a result of project work.\nMidstream sales in 2018 increased 11% from 2017 to $410 million, or 41% of total sales. Sales to gas utility customers were up by 14% while sales to transmission and gathering customers were up 7% over the same quarter in 2017.\nDownstream sales in 2018 increased 21% from 2017 to $298 million, or 29% of total sales. The U.S. downstream sector increased by $55 million, or 31%, primarily due to deliveries on a large U.S. project as well as spring turnarounds and growth from new contracts.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash balances were $45 million. Debt, net of cash, was $594 million and availability under our asset based lending facility was $409 million. During 2018, the company used $74 million of cash from operations to build working capital in anticipation of higher sales volume in 2018 and in advance of inflationary price increases.\nIn 2018, we entered into a 5-year interest rate swap on a portion of our LIBOR-based Term Loan B. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the rate on $250 million notional amount at 6.21%, consisting of a swap rate of 2.71% plus a margin of 3.50%.\nShare Repurchase Program Update\nIn October 2017, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for common stock of up to $100 million. During 2018, the company repurchased $30 million of its common stock at an average price of $17.39 per share. Subsequent to the first quarter, in April 2018, the company acquired $20 million of its common shares, also at an average price of $17.39, completing the current authorization. Under this program, the company has repurchased 6.1 million shares at an average price of $16.43.\nIn total, including both the 2017 and the prior 2015 share repurchase authorizations, the company has purchased 14.6 million shares at an average price of $15.38 per share. The outstanding share count as of April 27, 2018 is 89.7 million shares.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time) on May 3, 2018.

The company presents Adjusted EBITDA because the company believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful indicator of the company's operating performance. Among other things, Adjusted EBITDA measures the company's operating performance without regard to certain non-recurring, non-cash or transaction-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA, however, does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for certain expenses, its utility as a measure of the company's operating performance has material limitations. Because of these limitations, the company does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a primary performance measure and also uses other measures, such as net income and sales, to measure operating performance. See the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for a more thorough discussion of the use of Adjusted EBITDA.\nMRC Global Inc.\nSupplemental Information (Unaudited)\nReconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP measure) to Gross Profit\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\nof Revenue\n2017\nof Revenue\nGross profit, as reported\n$\n169\n16.7%\n$\n140\n16.2%\nDepreciation and amortization\n6\n0.6%\n5\n0.6%\nAmortization of intangibles\n11\n1.1%\n11\n1.3%\nIncrease in LIFO reserve\n7\n0.7%\n1\n0.1%\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$\n193\n19.1%\n$\n157\n18.2%\nThe company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of its LIFO inventory costing methodology. The company presents Adjusted Gross Profit because the company believes it is a useful indicator of the company's operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions of which they have been involved. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. The company uses Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing its business. The company believes that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nMRC Global Inc.\nSupplemental Sales Information (Unaudited)\n(in millions)\nSales by Segment\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nU.S.\n$\n806\n$\n666\nCanada\n78\n77\nInternational\n126\n119\n$\n1,010\n$\n862\nSales by Product Line\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nType\n2018\n2017 (1)\nLine pipe\n$\n158\n$\n146\nCarbon steel fittings and flanges\n171\n123\nTotal carbon steel pipe, fittings and flanges\n329\n269\nValves, automation, measurement and instrumentation\n378\n322\nGas products\n124\n116\nStainless steel and alloy pipe and fittings\n53\n41\nGeneral oilfield products\n126\n114\n$\n1,010\n$\n862\nNotes to above:\n(1)\n$18 million of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 have been reclassified from gas products to general oilfield products to conform with current year presentation.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mrc-global-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-300641418.html\nSOURCE MRC Global Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.sec.gov/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mrc-global-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-300641418.html", "http://www.mrcglobal.com/"], "published": "2018-05-03T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T02:59:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
