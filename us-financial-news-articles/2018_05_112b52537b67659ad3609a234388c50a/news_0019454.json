(Nasdaq: CGEN), a clinical-stage cancer immunotherapy company and a leader in predictive target discovery, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"Key developments in the first quarter of 2018 support Compugen's position as a leader in predictive discovery of new drug targets, and as an emerging clinical-stage immuno-oncology therapeutics company,\" said Anat Cohen-Dayag, Ph.D., President and CEO of Compugen. \"In late March, we filed an IND application for COM701, our leading first-in-class immuno-oncology therapeutic program targeting PVRIG. The FDA informed us that the IND application review can be completed once we provide additional information regarding COM701's assay method at a lower recommended starting dose. We have already initiated activities to provide the information to the Agency, and do not anticipate that this will impact our timelines and overall clinical plans.\"\n\"Preclinical data suggest that our PVRIG inhibitor may trigger an anti-tumor immune response alone and in combination with TIGIT and/or PD-1 inhibitors in many cancers. As COM701 is the first clinical antibody candidate targeting PVRIG to be available for testing dual and triple combinations with TIGIT and PD-1 inhibitors, we believe it places Compugen in a unique position and gives us a competitive edge in the immuno-oncology space.\"\n\"In the first quarter of the year, we also entered into a license agreement with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca. With this agreement we monetized one of our pipeline assets, in applications where we do not have existing development plans, to provide capital to support our ongoing development programs.\"\n\"In light of Bayer's announcement that they plan to begin first-in-human trials for their ILDR2 antibody, we expect that two first-in-class immuno-oncology programs based on our discoveries will be in the clinic in 2018. Advancing a program from computer prediction to IND filing is a tremendous achievement, and we are excited about the potential for these programs to provide meaningful benefit to cancer patients in need,\" concluded Dr. Cohen-Dayag.\nRecent highlights:\nSubmitted IND application for COM701, a novel first-in-class therapeutic antibody targeting PVRIG. Bayer presented preclinical data on BAY 1905254, its therapeutic antibody targeting ILDR2, at the annual meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research held in April 2018 and announced its plans to advance the program to clinical trial in 2018. Entered into a license agreement with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca, to enable the development of bi-specific and multi-specific immuno-oncology antibody products based on one of Compugen's pipeline programs.\nFinancial Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $10 million, compared with $0 in the comparable period of 2017. The revenues for the quarter reflect the upfront payment of $10 million from the license agreement with MedImmune.\nR&D expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $7.1 million, compared with $6.7 million for the comparable period in 2017. The increase in R&D expenses continues to reflect preclinical development activities, including those supporting the IND filing for COM701, as well as expenses associated with clinical-related activities in preparation for the Phase 1 trial expected to begin later in 2018.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.1 million, or $0 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $8.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the comparable period of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash, cash related accounts, short-term and long-term bank deposits totaled $20.5 million, not including the $10 million payment from MedImmune received after the quarter end, compared with $30.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Company has no debt.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCompugen will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results today, May 9, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET.
