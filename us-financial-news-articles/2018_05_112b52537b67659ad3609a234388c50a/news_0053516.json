Portola received $50 million at closing, with an additional $100 million payment contingent upon the FDA approval of Andexxa. The agreement is subject to a maximum total royalty payment of 195 percent of the $150 million funded by HCR, at which time the royalty obligation will expire.\n“Our partnership with HCR provides us with non-dilutive capital to fund the further development and commercialization of Andexxa,” said Bill Lis, chief executive officer of Portola. “We appreciate HCR’s support during this pivotal time in the Company’s evolution and their recognition of the life-saving potential of Andexxa as a reversal agent for Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeding.”\n“We are pleased to support the Company’s ongoing efforts to bring novel medicines like Andexxa to physicians and patients,” said Clarke Futch, managing partner and chairman of HCR’s Investment Committee.\nAbout HealthCare Royalty Partners\nHCR is a private investment firm that purchases royalties and uses debt-like structures to invest in commercial or near-commercial stage life science assets.
