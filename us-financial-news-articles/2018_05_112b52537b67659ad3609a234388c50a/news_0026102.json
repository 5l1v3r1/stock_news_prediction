REUTERS/Phelan Ebenhack\nTed Yoho, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, said on Thursday a “Cambodia Democracy Act of 2018” aimed to impose financial sanctions, in addition to visa restrictions that Washington placed last year, on Cambodian officials for “undermining democracy” with a crackdown on critics ahead of a July general election.\nCambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said the proposal “offended” Cambodia and was “bad” U.S. foreign policy.\n“He drafted the bill in his office from the other side of the world ... it destroys America’s credibility,” the spokesman, Phay Siphan, told Reuters.\nRelations between Cambodia and the United States have been strained recently over U.S. criticism of the government crackdown on dissent, and Prime Minister Hun Sen’s anger over what he says have been U.S. efforts to undermine his rule.\nThe United States has denied interfering in Cambodian politics.\nIn December, the United States said it would restrict entry to people involved in Cambodian action to undermine democracy, including the dissolution of the main opposition party and imprisonment of its leader.
