Both drivers finished where they started.\nFERRARI (Sebastian Vettel 2, Kimi Raikkonen 4)\nNo change from the grid position but Vettel clawed back three points from Hamilton and is now only 14 behind the Briton. Ferrari also reduced the gap to Mercedes in the constructors’ championship to 22 points.\nRED BULL (Daniel Ricciardo 1, Max Verstappen 9)\nRicciardo won from pole after setting the fastest time in every practice session and all stages of qualifying. It was his second win of the season, first from pole and seventh of his career and came despite power unit problems. Verstappen went from last to ninth and set the fastest lap. The race was Red Bull’s 250th start.\nRENAULT (Nico Hulkenberg 8, Carlos Sainz 10)\nBoth Renault drivers ended up in the points to pull further away from McLaren. Hulkenberg started 11th, Sainz eighth.\nMCLAREN (Stoffel Vandoorne 14, Fernando Alonso retired)\nAlonso retired at Sainte Devote on lap 53 after a transmission failure.

Vandoorne dropped two places from 12th at the start.\nFORCE INDIA (Esteban Ocon 6, Sergio Perez 12)\nOcon enjoyed his best result of the season so far in front of what is virtually a home crowd.
