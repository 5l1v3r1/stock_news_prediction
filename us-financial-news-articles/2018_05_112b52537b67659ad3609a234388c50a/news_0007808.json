It's all about inflation and Trump wrecking the economy with tariffs and earnings sucking and business bad and inflation raging. Good things do occur. They actually do\n@Jimcramer: Has anyone read even one word about how the Chinese might blink instead of the perceived wisdom that we have become a pitiful helpless giant that can't do a thing but make noise and then lose?\nCramer said Wall Street is going to need much more than \"a fast-food chain\" to move the market higher, referring to Dow component McDonald's reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Monday, sending its shares soaring.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
