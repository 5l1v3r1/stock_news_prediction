(“iPic” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IPIC), America’s premier luxury restaurant-and-theater brand, today reported financial results for the The Company also reiterated its full year 2018 outlook, including expectations for annual comparable-store sales growth of 0% to +5%, reiterated its four key strategic initiatives to create long-term value for stockholders, and announced that it expects to open its first theater in Saudi Arabia by year-end 2018.\nHamid Hashemi, Founder & Chief Executive Officer of iPic® Entertainment, commented, “We are in the very early stage of our growth story and are committed to taking advantage of the significant global opportunities ahead. We believe there is tremendous growth potential for the iPic brand to expand internationally while continuing to open new units domestically.”\nHashemi continued, “We remain laser focused on executing our four key strategic initiatives to meaningfully improve our top and bottom-line performance and create long-term value for our stockholders over time. We are on track to achieve our annual outlook, including comparable-store sales growth of 0% to +5%, and have already remodeled two of the up to five legacy locations to our Generation III design that we intend to complete this year. We are excited for more guests to experience the world-class hospitality provided at these enhanced theaters and the potential that our remodeled locations will have on our financial performance.”\nFinancial Results\nThe Company reported first quarter results, ended March 31, 2018, including:\nTotal revenue of $37.3 million. Comparable-store sales decrease of 5.1%, including 2.5% of lost capacity as a result of closed auditoriums from the Company’s two remodels that were completed in April. Net loss of $(21.8) million, inclusive of $8.6 million in stock-based compensation. Store-level EBITDA* of $3.3 million. EBITDA* loss of $(12.3) million. Adjusted EBITDA* loss of $(1.2) million.\n* Store-level EBITDA, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of store-level EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nFull Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the Company continues to expect the following:\nTotal revenue growth of +3% to +7%. Comparable-store sales growth of 0% to +5%. Store-level EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $17.0 million to $18.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, loss of $(1.5) million to $(0.5) million, reflecting a substantial improvement from full year 2017. Up to five remodels of existing locations with Generation I auditoriums, of which two have been completed to date. Capital expenditures of $20 million to $25 million, net of tenant improvement dollars.\nKey Strategic Initiatives\niPic is executing four key strategic initiatives in order to meaningfully improve its top and bottom-line results over time and create long-term value for stockholders.\n1. Improving Profitability from Existing Locations :\nA key revenue driver going forward will be the remodeling of the Company’s Generation I legacy locations into Generation III designs that, among other things, will include the installation of predominately Premium-Plus seating, including iPic’s latest Patented Pod Seats and Chaise Lounges. Premium-Plus seating currently comprises approximately 35% of seating in our Generation I auditoriums. The future remodeled Generation III designs will contain significantly more Premium-Plus seating, which generate higher revenue per screen than our Generation I locations. iPic expects to complete up to five remodels in 2018 starting with Scottsdale, AZ and Pasadena, CA that were completed in April, followed by Fairview, TX; Austin, TX; and Redmond, WA.\n2. Opening New iPic Locations Domestically :\nThe Company currently operates 115 screens at 15 locations in nine states with the ultimate long-term goal of reaching 200 locations across the US. iPic recently signed a lease in Atlanta, GA and has a robust pipeline of additional sites in lease negotiations. The Company plans to open at least four new domestic locations per year starting in 2019.\n3. Pursuing International Growth Opportunities :\nThe Company is actively exploring the potential to expand the iPic brand internationally through licensed and/or asset-light partnerships. In March, iPic announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with BAS Global Investments to develop its one-of-a-kind, world-class luxurious restaurant-and-theater iPic locations throughout The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Company expects to receive its license to operate theaters in Saudi Arabia and if so, to open its first iPic location by year-end 2018. iPic believes there is the potential for 25 to 30 iPic locations in Saudi Arabia within the next ten years and expects to expand in all parts of the country starting in Riyadh and Jeddah.\n4. Increasing Digital Growth Options (Membership and Sponsorship) :\nThe Company plans to leverage its growing membership network as the brand expands and increases its market presence. In 2017, iPic’s active users that have visited a location over the past year accounted for approximately 47% of revenue. In 2017, the Company earned $1.8 million from corporate sponsorships and believes that it has the opportunity to significantly grow its local and national sponsorship revenue. During the first quarter, other revenue grew 72% to $1.0 million compared to $0.6 million in the year-ago period. The Company expects other revenue to grow at a faster pace than food-and-beverage and theater revenues for the foreseeable future.\nConference Call\niPic today at 5:00 p.m. EDT.

The success of our new iPic locations is indicative of our brand appeal and the efficacy of our site selection and operating models.\nComparable-store sales – Comparable-store sales are a year-over-year comparison of sales at iPic locations open at the end of the period which have been open for at least 12 months prior to the start of such quarterly period. It is a key performance indicator used within the industry and is indicative of acceptance of our initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Our comparable iPics consisted of 13 and 14 iPics as of the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 2018, respectively. From period to period, comparable-store sales are generally impacted by attendance and average spend per person. Spend per person is, in turn, composed of pricing and sales-mix changes.\nStore-level EBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, store-level EBITDA consists of total revenues less store-level expenses that include food-and beverage cost-of-goods sold, box-office-and-other-income costs-of-goods-sold, labor costs, occupancy expenses and other-operating expenses.\nEBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and which also excludes equity-based compensation expense, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations.\nAbout iPic® Entertainment Inc.\nEstablished in 2010 and headquartered in Boca Raton, FL, iPic® Entertainment is America’s premier luxury restaurant-and-theater brand.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, equity-based compensation expense, pre-opening expenses, other income and loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property and equipment as well as certain non-recurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to our ongoing business performance. “Store-Level EBITDA” is a supplemental measure of our performance which we believe provides management and investors with additional information to measure the performance of our locations, individually and as an entirety. Store-Level EBITDA is defined by us as EBITDA adjusted for pre-opening expenses, other income, loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property and equipment, non-recurring charges, and general and administrative expense. We use Store-Level EBITDA to measure operating performance and returns from opening new stores. We believe that Store-Level EBITDA is another useful measure in evaluating our operating performance because it removes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at the store level, and the costs of opening new stores, which are non-recurring at the store-level, and thereby enables the comparability of the operating performance of our stores for the periods presented. We also believe that Store-Level EBITDA is a useful measure in evaluating our operating performance within the entertainment and dining industry because it permits the evaluation of store-level productivity, efficiency and performance, and we use Store-Level EBITDA as a means of evaluating store financial performance compared with our competitors.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate the adjustments we have made to GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur income and expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments used to calculate the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this press release because they are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Store-Level EBITDA is utilized to measure the performance of our locations, both individually and in entirety.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA are not GAAP measures of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not reflect tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, iPic openings and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future, including, among other things, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures $ Thousands Three Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss $ (21,761 ) $ (9,828 ) Plus: Interest expense 4,614 3,771 Income tax expense 22 22 Depreciation and amortization expense 4,840 4,718 EBITDA (12,285 ) (1,317 ) Plus: Pre-opening expenses - 632 Equity-based compensation 8,568 - Loss on abandonment of lease 1,839 - Non-recurring charges 652 726 Adjusted EBITDA (1,226 ) 41 Plus: General and administrative expense 4,547 3,912 Store-Level EBITDA 3,321 3,953\nInvestor Relations:\nICR\nMelissa Calandruccio, CFA\niPicIR@icrinc.com\n646-277-1273\nMedia Relations:\nThe Gab Group for iPic® Entertainment Corporate\nMichelle Soudry\nmsoudry@thegabgroup.com\n561-750-3500\nJonesworks\nStephanie Jones/Michelle Bower\nipic@jonesworks.com\n212-839-0111\nSource: iPicEntertainment Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pk7J5JDTLUursfNOuDmSZ9fg7zr6fftmExEHwRXrurkCWHvCEA19mbgL0PtHfTcmANKoONzPXTVcrFODauZmJA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SublV-rUn35vOTpAkBBv8n6DV5fFSrfKUnDYcMNNsUshQsUI2j0SGh2hQg-intxc", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FvHRhBrGQJj-5ykNJc75O-FnArPK88F3t1Cs_zfhMEV1R-d6Kzy4a9PevGzyXGAdCs2dIscti0PtLphLh7W-xQEYZOqWWA4xUNaShCZku9wEkdqdAnlGPu4PaFs5b7EV", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8e72d776-38d9-4014-ae7b-5e311f61265f", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mty_csAJbhZXEfrzL2UYXspiFxmqcxS0djuxhDAO0ImfvVHEyxTvzm_QLvABEVGeVOLb9IIYthdyRNheIkr2W_aCbAfXCWzVh-75Z0nYin0=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JSRKz_y01WGSWYXQmnCsAOGOXkJ_WVtHBJUKiLW1Y9EL-AwO2-biYISuCh3uIG6dlUlPzPwWp92d0M-PIXtdOSe4M0yP67oo-1ZhwAJ2oGo=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=62kVs0PAg5pwU71sJ3HnkKjch3wv3V9xrAZ1VgfAJLqTQUfyrOq5WHQMtRhMedgULopvpJd08x2g1xlyY7-KTM71awvLDmzB2D-p8MubI12Ne5qqTmNjvpqwclRn10tPgKB-FpeQY1BlxL8jZTxhL6WHiKhH6UqI7J5G-ED8a2CgJTutnGODPFQbx7-tR22xZ5xaA4xGIaM2Er9nEN0pYse34K80natgkKyNSN5en0wIio5iCQ5k27J8P9hWyMP0KUpMAHWDwIL2lg6de-Ej7jv-83paeHKwahPfnxai_QueRnSVHBQJ2KFbJRQ7HvHYt6M7POVIyQFCvIhPzS-Sgz1sPaORPrtcNY9LwW5odUZ18TDosuNXvX1Sa6nllRIUSld2IYG5w6hDrMFtkt5bTw=="], "published": "2018-05-16T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T02:53:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
