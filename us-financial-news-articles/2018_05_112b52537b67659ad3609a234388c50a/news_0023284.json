According to a 2015 article in The New York Times , \"In most cases … women still do the majority of the child care and housework — particularly managing the mental checklists of children's schedules and needs — even when both parents work full time.\"\nWorking moms also face the stigma that they're less productive at work and less committed to their job, despite the fact research shows they are just as productive as working fathers.\nAdd to that the fact that the average woman makes only 78 cents for every dollar earned by the average man , and you paint a pretty depressing picture for moms who hold another full-time job.

They are, in descending order, Vermont, Minnesota, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia and Connecticut.

Connecticut made up for a low number of professional opportunities with high ratings in 'child care' and 'work-life balance'.\nThe five worst states are South Carolina, Nevada, Alabama, Louisiana and Idaho, respectively. Alabama, Louisiana and Idaho ranked near or at the bottom in 'child care' and 'professional opportunities', while Alabama didn't rank above number 42 in any category.\nStates that voted Democratic in the 2016 presidential election are significantly friendlier toward working mothers, based on their average rank.\nSo if you're looking for the best place to live as a working mom, go northeast, young mother!\nMore from Payscale:\nHow to negotiate a new job offer\n3 ways to answer 'what are your salary expectations?'\nSalary raises: understanding cost of living vs. merit pay increases\nWATCH: The challenges facing working moms show chapters Mulcahy on Challenges Facing Working Moms 7:21 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2012", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2016/12/12/moms-have-it-tougher-than-dads-what-we-found-in-thousands-of-working-parent-surveys/", "https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2014/02/3-ways-to-answer-what-are-your-salary-expectations", "https://www.payscale.com/salary-negotiation-guide/im-negotiating-new-job-offer", "https://wallethub.com/edu/best-states-for-working-moms/3565/", "https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap", "https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2010/04/raises-cost-of-living-vs-merit-pay-increases", "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/upshot/stressed-tired-rushed-a-portrait-of-the-modern-family.html?_r=0", "https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2016/12/surprise-life-still-harder-working-moms"], "published": "2018-05-11T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T01:09:55.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
