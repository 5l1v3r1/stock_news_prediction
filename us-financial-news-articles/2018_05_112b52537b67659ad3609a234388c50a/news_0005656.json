MyoKardia’s initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle contraction. MyoKardia has used its precision medicine platform to generate a pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of two of the most prevalent forms of heritable cardiomyopathy – hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MyoKardia’s most advanced product candidate is mavacamten (formerly MYK-461), a novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin intended to reduce hypercontractility. Mavacamten is advancing into a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, known as EXPLORER-HCM in patients with symptomatic, obstructive HCM. MyoKardia is also developing mavacamten in a second indication, non-obstructive HCM, in the Phase 2 MAVERICK clinical trial. MYK-491, MyoKardia’s second product candidate, is designed to increase cardiac output in DCM patients by increasing the overall extent of the heart’s contraction cardiac contractility. MyoKardia is currently evaluating MYK-491 in a Phase 1b study in DCM patients. A cornerstone of the MyoKardia platform is the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on individuals and families with genetic heart disease, which MyoKardia helped form in 2014. MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for patients with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.\nContacts:\nMichelle Corral\nCorporate Communications & Investor Relations\nMyoKardia, Inc.\n650-351-4690\nmcorral@myokardia.com\nBeth DelGiacco (Investors)\nStern Investor Relations, Inc.\n212-362-1200\nbeth@sternir.com\nSource:MyoKardia, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/69c7a27b-1b77-4717-878b-d2ff10d08588", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H1DQboq7caHTyUBqn8dwDWvZ_Pu7sN3-DgIfJhQY_frvLq-SmN1Hm4MlUznc_-jRayvds9zbqcnFjjy1thBcyjpU3O-QfoAkXyQMYrX-qXfi-qGQQXWJvMzbEIhT-uVn"], "published": "2018-05-04T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T01:29:38.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
