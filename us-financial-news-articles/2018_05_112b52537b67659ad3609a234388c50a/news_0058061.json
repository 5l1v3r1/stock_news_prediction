REUTERS/Stringer\nChina’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said on Tuesday that the heavily populated industrial provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang and Sichuan were among the regions committing themselves to new measures, as well as Xinjiang and Tibet in the remote northwest. [nL2N1T0063]\nAs part of efforts to crack down on persistent polluters and negligent local administrations, Beijing launched a nationwide audit at the end of 2015 into the environmental records of 31 provinces and regions.\nTeams led by retired ministers were granted powers to make unannounced spot checks at factories and summon local bureaucrats to explain their actions. The inspections, completed last year, have already had a big impact.\n“There are definitely a lot of issues that might not have come to light without central government inspections, such as steel plants failing to retire capacity as ordered or building new capacity without a permit,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, clean air campaigner with environment group Greenpeace.\nIn a statement published by the MEE, Shandong on China’s eastern coast vowed to “unswervingly” implement government policies and restructure its heavy industrial economy.\nIt pledged to cut concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 by half compared to 2013, though Myllyvirta said the target of 49 micrograms per cubic meter was not especially ambitious.\n“Local officials are being incentivised very strongly to meet air quality targets so they shouldn’t be the ones setting them,” he said.

Most received an official reprimand and 22 face criminal charges.\nState-owned China Minmetals Group was also accused by inspectors of being a “big corporate bully” after failing to rectify violations.

[nL3N1SQ04P]\nMeanwhile the government is planning to launch a second round of regional inspections early next year, the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily reported last week.\n“It shows how resolute the Center is on this issue and how it is determined to keep up the pressure on the provinces,” said Peter Corne, managing partner at legal firm Dorsey & Whitney in Shanghai, who follows China’s environmental policies.\n“They have nowhere to hide,” he added.
