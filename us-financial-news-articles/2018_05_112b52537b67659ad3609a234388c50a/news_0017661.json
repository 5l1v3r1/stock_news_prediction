Secretary Elaine Chao will make the winners public on Wednesday. The governments in turn have partnered with companies who will play a role in the tests.\nAt least 200 companies applied as partners in the program, a U.S. official said.\nCompanies including Apple Inc, Boeing Co and Ford Motor Co have also expressed interest in the program, the sources said, though it was unclear whether they all had joined applications and what they would be testing.\nQualcomm confirmed it is on at least three applications, and Intel said it hopes to participate in the program. The other companies did not immediately answer requests for comment.\nChanges to U.S. policy that result from the tests are not expected for some time. Package delivery, which can be particularly complex, might not take place until later on during the program.\nEarl Lawrence, who directs the U.S. Federal Aviation Administrations unmanned aircraft systems integration office, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that many of the other projects \"could go forward under the FAAs existing rules, including with waivers where appropriate.\"\nHe said after \"the 10 selections for the pilot program are announced, the FAA will be reaching out to other applicants, as well as interested state and local authorities, to provide additional information on how to operationalize their proposed projects.\"\nThe FAA is also working on proposed regulations to ensure the safety of drones and their integration into U.S. airspace.\nThe initiative is significant for the United States, which has lagged other countries in drone operations for fear of air crashes. That had pushed companies like Amazon to experiment overseas.\nIn the United Kingdom, the world's largest online retailer already sends some packages by drone. It completed its first such mission in late 2016, taking 13 minutes from click to delivery.
