Select “Investors” then “Presentations.”\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by UHS as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), and excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, management, board and other non-recurring gain, expenses, or loss, which may not be calculated consistently among other companies applying similar reporting measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent an alternative to operating income or cash flows from operating, financing or investing activities (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)) as a measure of performance and are not representative of funds available for discretionary use due to UHS' financing obligations. EBITDA is included because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and financial analysts to assess and compare companies and is an integral part of UHS’ debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA is included because UHS’ financial guidance and certain compensation plans are based upon this measure. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an important perspective on the company's ability to service its long-term obligations, the company’s ability to fund continuing growth, and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. A reconciliation of consolidated net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included below.\n(In millions) 1st Quarter LTM 2018\n2017\n2018\nNet income (loss) attributable to UHS $ 4.7 $ (2.0 ) $ 15.4 Interest expense 13.5 13.5 53.8 Provision for income taxes 0.3 0.2 (17.1 ) 19.0 20.9 78.4 EBITDA 37.5 32.6 130.5 Management, board & other 1.7 1.4 9.4 Stock expense 0.7 0.8 3.0 Adjusted EBITDA $ 39.9 $ 34.8 $ 142.9 About Universal Hospital Services, Inc.\nUniversal Hospital Services, Inc. is a leading nationwide provider of health care technology management and service solutions to the health care industry.
