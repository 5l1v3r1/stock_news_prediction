Making an effort to connect with people face-to-face, be it at an event or through a mutual friend, can easily put your resume at the top of the pile and into the right hiring manger's hands.\nPhoto courtesy of Korn Ferry Korn Ferry CEO Gary Burnison \"You have to be proactive in that,\" he says. \"If you are just blindly sending out resumes then you might as well just go down to 7-Eleven and buy a lottery ticket.\"\nMatt Youngquist, career coach and president of Career Horizons tells NPR that \"at least 70 percent, if not 80 percent, of jobs are not published.\" Yet, he says, most people spend a majority of their time surfing the web for their next opportunity when they should be out networking.\nRather than getting in the habit of sending out endless resumes in hopes that you'll catch the attention of at least one employer, you should first take a step back and really assess the type of job you want.\n\"Start with purpose and happiness and an honest assessment of your strengths and weaknesses,\" says Burnison. \"Then target the cities and industries that you want to work in, and then do the networking.\"\nLike this story?
