Vice President Mike Pence staunchly opposes abortion rights.\nThe Trump administration reinstated a global gag rule that bans U.S.-funded groups around the world from discussing abortion and supports stripping federal funding from women’s health care clinics that offer abortions.\nMost recently on the state level, Iowa just outlawed abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which often occurs at six weeks and before a woman realizes she is pregnant.\nAmong its findings, the NAF said nationwide, the number of clinic blockades grew to 104 from 51.\nRepresentatives of Operation Save America, which staged a highly publicized blockade at a Louisville, Kentucky clinic last May, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nA spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which runs a National Task Force On Violence Against Health Care Providers to address abortion-related violence, declined to comment.\nThe NAF also said at clinics nationwide, incidents of obstruction aiming to disrupt services or intimidate patients rose to more than 1,700 from 580 in 2016, NAF said.\nThe number of threats of danger or death rose to 62 from 33, and more than 78,000 incidents of protests and picketing at clinics were reported as well.\nAnti-abortion violence has grown in America in the years since the Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade in 1973 made abortion legal.\nThe last deadly incident occurred at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in 2015 when a gunman killed three people and wounded nine others.\nReporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
