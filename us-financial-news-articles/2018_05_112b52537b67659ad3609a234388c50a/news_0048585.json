Geologists say the current cycle of eruption is among the worst events in a century from one of the world’s most active volcanoes.

REUTERS/Terray Sylvester While Kilauea’s lava flows are in a small, roughly 10-square-mile rural area in the southeast Puna district, the volcano is having an impact on tourism across the Big Island, home to 200,000 people.\nBeverly Oka’s family-run Uncle Billy’s Kona Bay Hotel is 120 miles (193 km) west of the lava flows, but bookings through the summer months are down around 40 percent.\n“We are not affected. We have some vog, but not more than usual,” said Oka of the volcanic smog that routinely blows from Kilauea, which has been in a near constant state of eruption since 1983. Her hotel is offering a 30 percent discount to try to lure customers.\nNorwegian Cruise Line canceled stops on the Big Island for its cruise ships due to “adverse conditions.” Royal Caribbean Cruises nixed a port call in Hilo, the island’s largest city, which is about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of the volcano.\nRob Guzman and his husband Bob Kirk fled their guest-house rental business just 6 miles (10 km) from the lava flows, unnerved by near constant tremors, clouds of toxic sulfur dioxide gas and risks highway escape routes would be cut off.\n“We’ve lost more than half of our household income and many other people will be in the same situation indefinitely,” said Guzman, a resident of Kalapana Seaview Estates, who is staying with friends north of Hilo.\nReporting by Jolyn Rosa; Writing by Andrew Hay in Taos, New Mexico; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://bit.ly/1NoB40V"], "published": "2018-05-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T04:32:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
