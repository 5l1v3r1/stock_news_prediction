The cash dividend will be paid on July 2, 2018, to shareholders of record on June 8, 2018. Kent A. Steinwert, Chairman, President and CEO noted, “The Board is pleased with the Company’s record first quarter 2018 financial results and unanimously approved the cash dividend. The Board believes our strong earnings performance allows for increasing the cash dividend while still providing a level of capital retention that supports the Company’s expansion plans. This year marks the 83 rd consecutive year that Farmers & Merchants Bancorp has paid cash dividends and the 53 rd consecutive year we have increased dividends. As a result of the reliability of our cash dividends over many decades, we remain a member of a select group of only 25 publicly traded companies referred to as 'Dividend Kings.'”\nFor the quarter ending March 31, 2018, Farmers & Merchants Bancorp reported net income of $9.9 million, or $12.24 per share, a 27.1% increase from net income of $7.8 million earned in the first quarter of 2017.
