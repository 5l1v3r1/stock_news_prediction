Statscan revised February’s decline to 0.4 percent from an initial drop of 0.8 percent.\nSales though only rose in Ontario - the most populous of Canada’s 10 provinces - and Saskatchewan in the west. Wholesale trade grew in four out of seven sectors in March, accounting for 49 percent of wholesale trade.\nRemoving the effects of price changes, sales volumes rose 0.8 percent from February.\nAfter three consecutive monthly falls, the motor vehicles and parts subsector posted a 5.0 percent gain on the back of motor vehicles sales, which rose to a near record high.\nSales in the building materials and supplies subsector increased by 3.4 percent to a record high while the food, beverage and tobacco subsector saw trade drop by 1.4 percent, the second consecutive dip.\nReporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:58:37.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
