Revenue fell 17 percent to $17.6 million.\nThe company, a licensor of signal processing platforms and artificial intelligence processors, was forecast to earn 11 cents a share on revenue of $18.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nCeva said it signed 14 licensing agreements in the quarter including two customers for its new NeuPro AI processor used in autonomous driving systems.\n“In our royalty business, the market experienced excess channel inventory in the low tier smartphone and feature phone markets, which resulted in weaker than expected baseband shipments in the first quarter,” CEO Gideon Wertheizer said.
