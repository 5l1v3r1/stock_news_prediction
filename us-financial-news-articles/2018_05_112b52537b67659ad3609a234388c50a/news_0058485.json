Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann has consistently criticized the slow normalization of asset purchases and interest rates in the region.\nLuxembourg-born Mersch was giving a speech in order to outline why the ECB needs new policy tools if it is to supervise firms that clear financial transactions denominated in euros.\nDANIEL ROLAND | AFP | Getty Images Most of those transactions are cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) currently based in the United Kingdom. This poses a potential oversight problem once Britain exits the European Union in March 2019.\nMersch said CCPs are crucial to a financial system's liquidity and any failure on their part could lead to contagion and bank failures.\nThe ECB currently does not have the power to regulate the activity of securities clearing systems, including CCPs. To address that problem, it is now looking to amend Article 22 of the \"Statute of the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank.\"\nMersch warned that any changes to Article 22 should not result in a list prescribing what the ECB can and cannot do to tackle its main target of price stability.\n\"We cannot open a Pandora's box and end up in a situation where monetary policy is no longer shielded against political influence,\" Mersch said.\nThe ECB member would not be drawn on which country in the future will host the majority of the euro-denominated clearing business. He said \"the market will take care of that\" while it was the ECB's job to provide clear laws.\nshow chapters ECB's Mersch: Have a mandate to safeguard integrity of the euro 7 Hours Ago | 01:36", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:52:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
