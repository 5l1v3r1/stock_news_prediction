The U.S. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give!”\nU.S. lawmakers on Tuesday rejected any plan by Trump to ease restrictions on ZTE, calling the telecommunications firm a security threat and vowing not to abandon legislation clamping down on the company.\n“There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings haven’t even started yet!” Trump said in tweets on Wednesday.
