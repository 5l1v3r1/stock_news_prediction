FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - FA Cup Semi Final - Chelsea v Southampton - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - April 22, 2018 Southampton's Oriol Romeu in action with Chelsea's Willian REUTERS/Darren Staples\nAfter a run of four straight defeats plunged Southampton deep into relegation trouble, Mark Hughes’ side have taken four points from their last two games following a 0-0 draw at Leicester City and a 2-1 win over Bournemouth.\nSouthampton are a point from safety with games against Everton, Swansea City and Manchester City rounding out the season.\n“You were going home after losing or drawing a game and thinking, ‘What do we have to do and when will we win a game?’ It was never our day,” Romeu told Daily Echo.\n“We are going to feel relaxed but we need to prepare for the next game because it does not give you too long to rest. The next one will be as important as this one so we have to go again.”\nRomeu said six points might be enough to guarantee survival.\n“It is difficult to tell. Hopefully two wins will do,” the 26-year-old Spaniard added. “The other opponents have difficult games coming and it is not going to be easy for them.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T10:30:41.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
