The decree requires sellers and operators of such assets to register with the SEC within 90 days.\nThe public hearing will take a 2-3 weeks because investments in digital tokens are complicated and carry high risks, Rapee said.\nThe finance ministry will impose a 15-percent withholding tax on gains from digital tokens and cryptocurrency trade, Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong said in March.\nThere will also be a 7-percent value-added tax, but general investors will be exempted, he said.\nThe Bank of Thailand will wait for the SEC - the primary regulator - to announce other regulations before taking action, according to Assistant BOT Governor Chantavarn Sucharitakul.\nIn February, the central bank asked financial institutions not to get involved in cryptocurrency transactions for fear of possible problems.
