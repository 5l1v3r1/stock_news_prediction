Hungary put up a razor wire fence on its borders with Serbia and Croatia during the crisis in 2015, when more than a million migrants came to Europe.\nReporting by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T13:36:02.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
