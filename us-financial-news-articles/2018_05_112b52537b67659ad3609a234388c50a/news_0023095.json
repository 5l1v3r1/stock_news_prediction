All dollar amounts are stated in US funds.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS:\nRevenue and net operating income (“ NOI ”) were up 15.6% and 14.7% over the same period last year Funds from operations (“ FFO ”) and adjusted funds from operations (“ AFFO ”) were up 13.5% and 11.7%, respectively, over the same period last year Net income and comprehensive income, excluding all fair value adjustments, was up 21.8% over the same period last year Same properties NOI was up 3.1% over the first quarter in 2017 Occupancy remains strong at 98.1% at March 31, 2018 100% of leases expiring in 2018 were renewed Approximately 865,000 square feet of leases expiring after March 31, 2018 were renewed, including the REIT’s tenth largest tenant, Honeywell International, Inc.\n“Our first quarter results reflect the benefits of our 2017 acquisitions, development and expansion activity as well our proactive asset management programs,” commented Scott Frederiksen, Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to evaluate a number of potential acquisition and development opportunities, focusing on properties and markets that will enhance the scale and diversity of the REIT’s portfolio.”\nSOLID OPERATING PERFORMANCE\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, investment properties revenue was $22.5 million compared to $19.5 million in the same period last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to the contribution from our 2017 acquisitions, development and expansion activity, an increase in base rent in existing properties and higher recoveries of operating expenses, partially offset by the sale of a non-core property in August 2017. Net income and comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $7.8 million ($0.161 per trust unit and class B partnership unit (collectively, “Unit”) compared to $18.9 million ($0.458 per Unit) in the same period last year. The decrease in net income is mainly due to fair value adjustments. Excluding all fair value adjustments, net income was $10.1 million compared to $8.3 million in the same period last year.\nNOI for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $16.4 million compared to $14.3 million in the same period last year. Same property NOI increased 3.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increases in contractual base rent, higher recoveries of operating expenses, and a slight increase in occupancy.\nAFFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $9.5 million ($0.197 per Unit) compared to $8.5 million ($0.205 per Unit) in the same period last year.\nCash flow from operations and adjusted cash flow from operations (“ACFO”) were $15.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively, compared to $14.4 million and $9.0 million in the same period last year. The REIT’s ACFO payout ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 91.5% compared to 87.2% in the same period last year.\nSTRONG FINANCIAL & LIQUIDITY POSITION\nAs at March 31, 2018, the REIT’s debt-to-gross-book-value ratio was 42.1% with an interest coverage ratio of 3.8 times, a debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings before fair value adjustments to investment properties, interest (inclusive of finance costs), taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of 7.1 times, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.2 times, all consistent with or improved from last year. The weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding debt was 3.7% at March 31, 2018, consistent with the prior year.
