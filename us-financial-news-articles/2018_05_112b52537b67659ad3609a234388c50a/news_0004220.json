You can identify these statements by our use of the words “assumes,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “guidance,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. All statements other than statements of historical fact are You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Company’s control and could materially affect actual results, performance, or achievements. Important risk factors that may affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial position are detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this press release. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release presents Funds From Operations (“FFO”), FFO per diluted share, Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”), AFFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures (i) do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO, FFO per diluted share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs. In addition, these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to make interest payments on our indebtedness. We believe FFO, FFO per diluted share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business.\nFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. Consistent with the definition used by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), we define FFO as net income (or loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property plus real estate depreciation. AFFO is a non-GAAP measure that is used as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. We calculate AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO direct financing lease adjustments, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, other non-cash interest expense, non-real estate depreciation (which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations), impairment charges on non-real estate assets, amortization of capitalized leasing costs and debt extinguishment gains and losses.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income as adjusted for gains (or losses) from sales of property, real estate depreciation, direct financing lease adjustments, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, other non-cash interest expense, non-real estate depreciation (which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations), impairment charges on non-real estate assets, amortization of capitalized leasing costs, debt extinguishment gains and losses, provision for income taxes and interest expense, net.\nIn our calculation of AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA, while we do not label transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments as non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual, management believes that it is helpful to adjust for these expenses when they do occur to allow for comparability of results between periods because each acquisition is (and will be) of varying size and complexity and may involve different types of expenses depending on the type of property being acquired and from whom.\nBecause not all companies calculate FFO, FFO per diluted share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA in the same way we do and other companies may not perform such calculations, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way we calculate such measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliations of net income to FFO, FFO per diluted share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this release.\nVICI Properties Inc.
