The benchmark government yield reached a high of 3.058 percent, blowing through the key psychological level of 3 percent it hit in late April for the first time in four years. The move came in the wake of a 0.3 percent rise in U.S. retail sales last month, which although small suggested consumer spending is on track to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter. Along with accelerating inflation and a widening fiscal deficit, that increased bets that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates by more than expected, something that has driven a global emerging market selloff in recent weeks. \"It looks like there's no limit to how high the dollar can go. The market has been in panic mode in the last few weeks and the only thing we can do is sit and watch,\" a portfolio manager at a Rio de Janeiro-based asset management firm said. The Brazilian real weakened 1.2 percent to its lowest in two years, while the Mexican peso touched a one-year low. Both currencies were also pressured by local issues, with Brazil headed to its hardest-to-predict elections in decades and Mexico struggling to close a deal with the United States and Canada to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement. But the Argentine peso, which has been by far the biggest loser in the region this year, traded flat after the country's central bank offered to sell up to $5 billion in a bid to stop the currency's slide. Argentina requested a \"high access stand-by arrangement\" from the International Monetary Fund last week after the peso depreciated rapidly, prompting the central bank to start selling reserves and hike interest rates.
