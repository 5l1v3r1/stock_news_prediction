Daimler declined to comment in detail about the Spiegel report.\nThe Transport Ministry said it has asked the KBA to pursue any further leads related to emissions at Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz premium brand. The KBA declined comment.\nThe Spiegel report comes a day after the KBA ordered Daimler to recall the Mercedes Vito van model fitted with 1.6 litre Diesel Euro-6 engines because of engine control features to reduce exhaust emissions which KBA said breached regulations. Daimler said it is appealing the KBA findings and will go to court if necessary. (Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Markus Wacket in Berlin and Ilona Wissenbach in Frankfurt.
