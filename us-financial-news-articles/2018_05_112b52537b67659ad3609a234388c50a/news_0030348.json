Democrats need a net total of 23 to assume the House majority, which would likely derail Republican President Donald Trump’s policy agenda.\nPennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when the state Supreme Court found that the current congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans. The redrawn map has made some districts more competitive.\nIn addition, six incumbent House Republicans are not running for re-election, further scrambling the races and requiring voters to become familiar with a raft of first-time candidates.\nSome 81 candidates are running for 18 congressional seats, including 10 Democrats in a single race.\nDemocrats feel confident they can ultimately win three districts in suburban Philadelphia regardless of which candidates win their primaries on Tuesday because of the liberal tilt of those areas.\nA more interesting contest comes in the northeastern district being vacated by retiring Representative Charlie Dent, one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the House.\nThe largest city in the district, Allentown, sustained huge job losses with the 1995 closing of the Bethlehem Steel plant, once been a pillar of the region’s economy.\n(L-R) U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Democrat Greg Edwards, Pennsylvania's 7th District Congressional candidate, wave to supporters during a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S. May 5, 2018.

In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton edged Trump in the district by a single percentage point in the presidential election, he noted.\nDemocrats are also hoping to pick up a seat held by first-term Republican Brian Fitzpatrick in another district outside of Philadelphia. Attorney Scott Wallace faces Navy veteran Rachel Reddick in the Democratic primary there.\nMadonna said he expected Pennsylvania to see the same surge in Democratic turnout that marked recent special elections. Typically, about 20 percent of Democrats vote in midterm elections. This time, it could be closer to 30 percent, he said.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Nebraska will also hold a primary on Tuesday that could affect the balance of power in the House.
