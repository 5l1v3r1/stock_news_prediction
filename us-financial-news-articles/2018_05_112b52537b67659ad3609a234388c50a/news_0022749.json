It said a ban could be enforced only in individual cases of “sufficiently specific danger.”\nReporting by Laura Dubois; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:40:09.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
