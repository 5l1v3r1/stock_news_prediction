The stock's median price target is $33. It fell to around $30 in premarket on Friday, from a close of $32.95 before the results numbers on Thursday.\n\"Old Navy had been firing on all cylinders but the performance in 1Q was not enough to drive margin improvement at the company level despite representing just under half the business,\" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Pamela Quintiliano.\n\"We have little to hang our hat on as of yet.\" (Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T23:02:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
