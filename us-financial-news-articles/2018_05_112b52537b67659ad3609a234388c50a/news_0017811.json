Transactions are stalling,” he said. “Previously it used to take about three weeks (to transfer a title) but now it takes a month or more.”\nKenya is also exploring ways of moving its land registry on to a blockchain platform, which is a ledger of digital transactions that make records secure and easily verifiable, Karoney said.\nRwanda is one of the few African nations that have managed to move all their land records online and is considering introducing blockchain.\nReporting by Kevin Mwanza; Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, resilience and climate change.
