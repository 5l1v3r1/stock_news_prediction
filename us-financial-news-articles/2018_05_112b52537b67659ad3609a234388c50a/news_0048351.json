Olsen denies any wrongdoing in the matter, which is being investigated by the authorities in France.\nThe company’s results have also been disappointing so far, triggering a revamp of its strategy under new Chief Executive Jan Jenisch, focusing more on growth and concentrating on fewer markets.\nThe group in March announced a 400 million Swiss franc ($404 million) cost-cutting programme, saying it would be closing its Singapore and Miami offices by the middle of this year.\n$1 = 0.9909 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill and Oliver Hirt; Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:15:31.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
