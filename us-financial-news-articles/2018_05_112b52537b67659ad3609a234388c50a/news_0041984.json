The prosecutor did not identify the banned group, Hanafi said.\nA judicial source confirmed Mohamadeen’s detention but gave no further comment.\nMohamedeen had been detained at least twice in the past, once in 2013 on accusations of belonging to a secret organisation and spreading lies about the military, and again in 2016 for calling for protests against the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia.\nHis detention follows those of other prominent activists.\nState security prosecutors this week ordered Shady Ghazaly Harb, a leading opposition figure during the 2011 “Arab Spring” uprising that toppled Resident Hosni Mubarak, held for 15 days for investigation over accusations including joining a terrorist organization, according to state news agency MENA.\nLast week, authorities detained Amal Fathy for 15 days for investigation on charges of insulting the state after she posted a video on social media criticizing the government for failing to protect women against sexual harassment.\nCampaigners say Egypt’s human and civil rights record has deteriorated sharply under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi’s supporters say his tough security policy is needed to ensure stability as Egypt recovers from years of political chaos and tackles economic challenges and an Islamist insurgency.\nSisi this week pardoned more than 330 people, many of them young people jailed for demonstrating in recent years.
