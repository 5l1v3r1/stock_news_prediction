DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS/MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES (MSF)/via REUTERS\nThe WHO’s deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response Peter Salama told Reuters several staff had already signed up for immunization with the VSV-EBOV vaccine. The shot, developed by Merck, has not yet been fully licensed but has proven safe and effective in trials.\n“For the first time, we are offering vaccination to all international responders - and we’ll be doing that in Geneva and in Kinshasa,” Salama said on Thursday in a telephone interview.\nHe said the first shots would be given in Geneva on Friday.\n“I haven’t got the latest on how many people have signed up yet, but I anticipate that a lot of people will get vaccinated.”\nWHO figures show there have already been 44 suspected, probable or confirmed cases of Ebola in this outbreak, and 23 people have died.\nPotentially most worrying is a confirmed case in the city of Mbandaka, which has a population of about a million.\nSalama, who traveled to the affected areas of Congo last weekend, said he would “certainly” be getting the vaccine before going for his next visit.\nThe first batch of around 4,000 Ebola vaccines was sent by the WHO to the DRC capital Kinshasa on Wednesday.\nThe health ministry has said vaccinations for local health workers and come contacts of people who have had Ebola can start by early next week.
