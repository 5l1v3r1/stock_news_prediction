Hearings are scheduled for June 21.\nThe petrochemcial products trader said it is seeking legal advice on the proceedings and the impact on its financial position would become clearer after the hearings.\nReporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:16:40.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
