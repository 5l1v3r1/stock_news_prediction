Kinerja Indonesia.\nThe rapid expansion of KinerjaPay has enabled the Company to have the ability to consolidate its IP technology and data center assets. When KinerjaPay was set up several years ago, the company contracted with the private PT. Kinerja Indonesia company to provide Data Center & Business Services. KinerjaPay's rapid growth has resulted in its becoming the largest full-time customer at PT. Kinerja Indonesia. The two-year Service Agreement has come to its conclusion and KinerjaPay has decided to merge with this business. This consolidation will enable KinerjaPay to report all the sales running through the KinerjaPay network under GAPP rules. In addition, it will now own its cloud network and IP technology.\nThe acquisition positions the company to launch its services into Vietnam and Thailand. Owning the cloud-based technology will enable the company to offer its customers the ability to expand beyond Indonesia. Similar to Amazon and Alibaba, KinerjaPay will now be able to enter the cloud computing services business, called KinerjaCloud.\nThe merger with PT. Kinerja Indonesia will take approximately three months to complete. The company will issue 1,333,333 restricted common shares to acquire PT. Kinerja Indonesia.\nAbout KinerjaPay\nKinerjaPay enables consumers to \"Pay, Play and Buy\" through its secure web portal and mobile applications.
