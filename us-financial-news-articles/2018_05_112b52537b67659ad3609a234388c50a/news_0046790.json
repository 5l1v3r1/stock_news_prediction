The conflict has also left a quarter of the country’s population of 12 million either internally displaced or as refugees in neighboring countries.\nIGAD’s statement did not mention on which issues the two sides had failed to reach agreement but encouraged them to consider the group’s proposals, which “reflect a considered effort to identify common ground between the different negotiating positions.” Reporting by Aaron Maasho; additional reporting by Denis Dumo; writing by Elias Biryabarema; editing by Susan Fenton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T23:22:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
