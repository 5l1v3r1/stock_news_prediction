Photo: Bloomberg News\nGerman pharmaceuticals group Merck KGaA for the first time drilled down on the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on its results in more detailed guidance, said the company’s finance chief.\nCurrency fluctuations are expected to reduce sales by 4% to 6% this year, Chief Financial Officer Marcus Kuhnert told CFO Journal on Tuesday. The company expects to book sales of between €15.0 billion ($17.8 billion) and €15.5 billion during the 2018 financial year, compared to sales of €15.3 billion in 2017. Organic growth is expected to boost sales by 3% to 5%.\nShifts in the foreign exchange markets are expected to weigh down earnings, Mr. Kuhnert said. Merck’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization are forecast to come in between €3.9 billion and €4.1 billion, with currency fluctuations taking away 5% to 7%.\nThis is the first time that Merck provides this level of detail, said Mr. Kuhnert. “We have to become more transparent,” he added.\nThe company reported a €305 million-currency hit on its revenue in the first quarter, mainly on the back of a stronger euro. The common European currency has appreciated more than 15% year-over-year against the U.S. dollar. It has also risen against other currencies.\nMerck generated roughly a quarter of the €3.7 billion first-quarter sales in North America, a large part of that in the U.S. The company hedges against swings in the value of the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Korean won, Taiwan dollar and Swiss Francs. Between 30% to 70% of Merck’s exposure to these currencies are hedged at any given time, said Mr. Kuhnert. At the moment, the company has protected more than 50% of its currency exposure, he added. Merck hedges around 12 months in advance, according to the finance chief.\nOther pharmaceuticals companies on average hedge around 75% of their currency exposure, said Wimal Kapadia, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The more detailed guidance provided by Merck is helpful, he added. “We can now see what the [currency] impacts will be,” said Mr. Kapadia.\nMr. Kuhnert expects only a marginal impact, should import tariffs proposed by the U.S. and the Chinese government go ahead. Such levies would mainly affect the company’s life sciences division and cost a single-digit euro million amount, he said. “The effect will be very limited,” said Mr. Kuhnert.\nMerck remains committed to reducing its debt load, he said. A large chunk of the proceeds of the sale of its consumer health-business to Procter & Gamble Co. for €3.4 billion will be spent on debt reduction, said Mr. Kuhnert. Net debt was €9.9 billion as of March 31, 2018.\nShare this: CUURENCY HEDGING Previous The Morning Ledger: Automation Frees Up Workers For More Creative Tasks Next Home Depot Shrugs Off Winter Blues ", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-10565/c", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10723/c"], "published": "2018-05-16T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T01:23:41.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
