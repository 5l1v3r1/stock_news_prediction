(NASDAQ:RELV), a maker of nutritional supplements that promote optimal health, today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst-Quarter Results\nReliv reported net sales of $10.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with net sales of $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the United States decreased to $7.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, which represented a 25.2 percent decline in net sales when compared to the prior-year quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, Reliv launched the Fit3 line of products in the United States. Net sales in Reliv’s foreign markets decreased 7.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the prior-year first quarter. Net sales in Europe and Asia decreased by 3.0 and 7.8 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018, along with decreases in other regions.\nReliv reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2018 of $238,000 (loss per diluted share of $0.13) compared to net income of $524,000 (income per diluted share of $0.28) in the first quarter of 2017. The loss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $224,000 compared to income from operations of $517,000 in the same period in 2017. Results from operations were primarily impacted by the decline in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses in the quarter. SGA expenses decreased from $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.\n“Our sales comparisons for the first quarter of 2018 were a challenge compared to the prior year that included the launch of the Fit3 line,” said Ryan A. Montgomery, President. “Clearly, we have work to do in revitalizing the sales in the United States and in other markets around the Reliv world. That work has been underway, highlighted by some key announcements at our Reliv Live event in Anaheim.”\nAt its regional spring distributor conference in Anaheim, Reliv unveiled its newest technology and tools designed to give Reliv independent distributors an edge. First, the company launched the Reliv Mobile App, which gives distributors a fast and easy way to recruit and run their business on the go. A whole host of new video content is featured in the app to assist distributors in sharing the Reliv product line and business opportunity. In addition, the company revealed its newest business opportunity presentation – a more engaging, concise and video-centric model designed to give distributors an easier way to present the Reliv opportunity and product line.\nAlso, Reliv formally introduced its newest core nutrition product – Reliv Now ® with Whey. Formulated using the same optimal blend of vitamins, minerals and herbs of Reliv Now ® with Soy, this newest product gives consumers an additional protein source to make Reliv more competitive with its offerings in the marketplace. Distributors now have a simplified approach to product positioning with Step 1: Core Nutrition and Step 2: Customizing nutrition with Targeted Solutions.\nReliv is continuing additional distributor/customer recruitment programs such as free ground shipping for new distributors reaching the Quick Start and Master Affiliate business levels, a 20 percent discount on autoship orders placed by Preferred Customers, and its product credit incentive, “3 & Free”, to distributors for having three new Preferred Customers with a minimum order amount.\n“These initiatives, along with other coming programs and promotions, will be the springboard of our growth strategy for 2018,” commented Montgomery.\nReliv had cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $3.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Net cash generated from operating activities was $500,000 in the first quarter of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Reliv had 32,100 distributors and preferred customers – a decrease of 13.9 percent from March 31, 2017 – of which 3,140 are Master Affiliate level and above. The number of Master Affiliates decreased by 12.5 percent compared to the year-ago total. Master Affiliate is the level at which distributors are eligible to earn generation royalties.\nAbout Reliv International, Inc.\nReliv International, based in Chesterfield, MO, produces nutritional supplements that promote optimal nutrition.
