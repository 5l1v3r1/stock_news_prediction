Since the Malaysian general election on May 9, they have shed about 20 percent, giving AirAsia a market value of roughly $2.5 billion.\nBy 0806 GMT, AirAsia shares were down about 8 percent, while the broader Malaysian market was down nearly 3 percent.\nAirAsia India, a venture with India's Tata Sons conglomerate, said in a statement on Tuesday it refuted any allegations of wrongdoing and was co-operating with all regulators and agencies \"to present the correct facts\".\nAirAsia on Wednesday referred requests for comment to AirAsia India.\nOn Twitter, Fernandes did not directly address the accusations but complained about media who reported without fact-checking. A majority shareholder in British soccer team Queens Park Rangers, he also tweeted video of himself playing a virtual reality soccer game. He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nINDIA PLANS\nThe flamboyant CEO, who co-founded AirAsia in 2001 with two aircraft, announced plans for an IPO for the India unit in January, part of a series of strategic moves to monetise assets.\nAirAsia India had 14 planes at end-2017, and has plans to expand its fleet to 60 over the next five years. Under Indian rules, it can launch international flights once it has 20 planes.\nPng said AirAsia India's expansion had been too aggressive, resulting in losses doubling in the quarter ended March 31.\n\"This raises the possibility that AirAsia Group will need to inject more capital into AirAsia India, which may not sit well with AirAsia Group's investors,\" she said.\nAirAsia last week reported a record quarterly profit of 1.14 billion ringgit ($286 million), due in large part to the sale of a ground handling services unit.\nSince the election, Fernandes has apologised for endorsing former prime minister Najib Razak in the election, saying he buckled under government pressure.\nMalaysian police are investigating Fernandes at the request of regulatory body, the Malaysian Aviation Committee, which has denied Fernandes' accusations that it ordered the airline to cancel 120 flights during the election period.\nFewer flights would have made it more difficult for Malaysians abroad to fly home to vote.
