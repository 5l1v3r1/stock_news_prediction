His case is still pending.\nAlthough the law banning homosexuality is rarely enforced in India, it is used to intimidate, harass, blackmail and extort money from gay people, activists say.\nAll forms of non-penile vaginal sex are also criminalized under Section 377. Gay sex is punishable by up to 10 years jail under the law.\nThere is no official data on the LGBT population in India, but the government estimates there are 2.5 million gay people, reflecting those who have declared their sexuality to the health ministry.\nCampaigners say real numbers are far higher, as many conceal their identities fearing discrimination in a country where most marriages still take place within the boundaries of caste and religion.\nReporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Jared Ferrie.
