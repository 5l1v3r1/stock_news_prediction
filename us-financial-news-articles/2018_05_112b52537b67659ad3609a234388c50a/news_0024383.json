(Nasdaq: PCTI), a leader in P erformance C ritical TEL ecom solutions, announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights from Continuing Operations\nRevenue of $21.7 million in the quarter , in line with guidance, down 5% from the first quarter last year. Connected Solutions segment revenue was up 3%. RF Solutions segment revenue was down 30%, due to deferred carrier capital budget deployment in North America. Gross profit margin of 36.2% in the quarter, down 500 basis points compared to last year. The primary reason for the decrease is lower revenue in the RF Solutions segment which has higher margin from its scanner products compared to antenna products. Price erosion in the small cell antenna market also contributed to the decline. Net loss per diluted share of $0.05 in the quarter, compared to net income of $0.01 last year. Non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA are measures the Company uses to reflect the results of its core earnings. A reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to our financial statements is provided later in the press release. Non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.01, compared to Non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.05 in the first quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percent of revenue of 2% in the quarter, compared to 7% last year. $34.7 million of cash and short-term investments and no debt at March 31, 2018.\n“The Company saw revenue growth for its Connected Solutions products in the enterprise Wi-Fi market during the quarter. RF Solutions revenue was down in the North American market, due to the slow release of capital budget by several U.S. carriers,” said David Neumann, PCTEL’s CEO. “PCTEL is well positioned to take advantage of the long-term growth opportunities in Industrial IoT and 5G, which require both performance critical antenna solutions across multiple vertical markets and RF test equipment.”\nCONFERENCE CALL / WEBCAST\nPCTEL’s management team will discuss the Company’s results today at 4:30 p.m. ET.
