The shadows of workers are seen in the City of London financial district, London, Britain, January 25, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nThe Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said employers on average planned to raise basic pay for staff by 2.1 percent at their next annual pay settlement, compared with 1.8 percent three months ago.\nThe CIPD data fit with a broad pattern of labour shortages and gradually rising pay shown in other surveys and official data, which lie behind the Bank of England’s view that it will need to gradually raise interest rates over the coming years.\nThis positive employment picture contrasts with the economy as a whole in the first three months of 2018, which grew at its weakest annual rate in five years, prompting the BoE to defer a previously widely expected rate rise in May.\nGerwyn Davies, senior labour market analyst for the CIPD, said employer optimism about job prospects meant that those weak provisional GDP figures should not be put under “too pessimistic interpretation”.\nDemand for labour continued to grow in the second quarter of 2018, and was not matched by supply, Davies added.\n“This may explain why wage pressures are starting to increase following a prolonged period of relatively subdued pay growth. It could well be that employers are using higher starting salaries to attract the talent they need,” he said.\nMedian pay awards over the past 12 months were 2 percent, according to the CIPD’s data.\nLast month pay data company XpertHR said average pay settlements in the first three months of 2018 rose to 2.5 percent, their joint highest since 2008.\nPay growth according to the CIPD’s measure - which covers existing staff, and does not capture the effect of promotions or staff moving to better paid jobs - is lower than official data that shows average weekly earnings rose by 2.8 percent year-on-year in the three months to February.\nThe unemployment rate fell to its lowest since 1975 over the same period, dropping to 4.2 percent.\nAlmost one in three employers surveyed by the CIPD said they were raising wages to tackle their recruitment struggles, and the proportion of public-sector employers expecting to raise pay by 2 percent or more rose to almost two in five.\nIn March, trade unions and public-sector employers agreed a 6.5 percent pay rise over three years for more than a million nurses and hospital staff.\nThe CIPD data was based on a survey of several hundred employers between March 9 and March 30.
