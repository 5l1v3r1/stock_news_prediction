Indeed, in March, Prince Harry and Markle sampled each of the dishes (made from scratch) at tasting trials held in the Windsor Castle kitchen.\nMost of the produce for the menu will be sourced from the U.K., some from Her Majesty's Estates at Windso r , and other from places like Kent, which has been dubbed as the \"garden\" of England and Norfolk for its fertile farmland and fruit-filled orchards .\nThings like asparagus and elderflower are in season there in May, according to a Kent farmer's market website . And behind-the-scenes photos of royal chef Flanagan and his team in the Windsor Castle Kitchen feature fresh asparagus, artichokes, peas and tomatoes. TWEET\nAnd Kensington Palace has announced that Prince Harry and Markle have selected pastry chef Claire Ptak, owner of the East London-based bakery Violet Cakes, to create their wedding confection.\n\"Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have asked Claire to create a lemon elderflower cake that will incorporate the bright flavours of spring,\" the Kensington Palace said. \"It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.\"\nTraditionally, royals have fruit cake when they tie the knot; Prince William and Kate Middleton served up slices of the dessert, as did Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip and Prince Charles and Princess Diana, among others . So Prince Harry's and Markle's choice of cake, which will reportedly be made with organic Amalfi lemons and English elderflower, is a more modern choice.\nCalifornia-raised Ptak, who Markle previously interviewed for her now defunct lifestyle website, The Tig, is known for using seasonal and organic ingredients. She has given her social media followers a glimpse inside her cake-making process in the days leading up to the nuptials.\n\"And so it begins\" she captioned an Instagram photo featuring crates of lemons.\nPhotos on Violet Cakes' Instagram account show beautiful pastries adorned with flowers and fresh fruit. On its website, Violet Cakes has wedding cakes that serve 150 people priced at $1,059. Meanwhile, there will be up to 600 guests attending the royal wedding reception.\nIn the past, slices of royal wedding cake have been auctioned off , sometimes fetching up to $7,500.\nThere will also likely be chocolate truffles, which the Buckingham Palace says is a, \"favorite dessert served at receptions throughout the year at Windsor Castle.\"\n\"You approach every Royal event with the same care and attention to detail,\" says pastry chef Selwyn Stoby, who will be working on the day of the wedding. \"But you don't get many opportunities to do a Royal Wedding in your lifetime, so this is very special.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/995952864106373120", "http://home.bt.com/news/royal-chef-excited-about-the-royal-wedding-day-91364271488778", "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-wedding-menu.html", "https://www.royal.uk/inside-royal-kitchens-windsor-castle", "http://www.violetcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Violet-Wedding-Cake-Menu.pdf", "https://www.vogue.com/article/british-royal-wedding-fruitcake", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/16/time-prince-harry-meghan-markle-getting-married-full-royal-wedding/", "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/951772/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-prince-harry-food-vans-news-latest-exclusive", "https://www.travelaboutbritain.com/information/garden-of-england.php", "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding-cake-breaks-with-centuries-of-royal-tradition", "http://www.kfma.org.uk/whats_in_season"], "published": "2018-05-17T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:09:39.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
