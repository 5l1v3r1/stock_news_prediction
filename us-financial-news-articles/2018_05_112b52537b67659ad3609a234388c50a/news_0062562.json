(TSX VENTURE:BMR.H) (“Bradmer” or the “Company”) today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFinancial Results\nAmounts in US dollars, unless specified otherwise, and results prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net loss of $273,000 or $0.014 per common share based on the weighted average outstanding shares of 19,659,726 during the three month period, compared to a net loss of $33,000 or $0.002 per common share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 based on the weighted average outstanding shares of 19,659,726.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $280,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $28,000 in the same quarter of the prior year. Major expenses in 2018 consisted of legal fees of $253,000, consulting fees of $14,200, filing fees of $6,300, audit fees of $2,900 and directors and officers’ liability insurance premiums of $2,500. In 2017 major expenses consisted of consulting fees of $13,600, legal fees of $6,000, audit fees of $2,800 and directors and officers’ liability insurance premiums of $2,400.\nThe main reason for the increased net loss in 2018 is the $247,000 increase in legal fees related to the ongoing work on the reverse takeover transaction.\nCash financed Bradmer’s operational activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $56,000, compared to working capital of $218,000 at December 31, 2017. Bradmer had available cash of $266,000 (CDN $344,000) as at March 31, 2018, compared to cash of $319,000 (CDN $400,000) as at December 31, 2017. The $53,000 decrease in cash was due to the $273,000 net loss partially offset by the $222,000 decrease in non-cash working capital.\nAs at May 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had 19,659,726 common shares and options to purchase 1,950,000 common shares outstanding.\nBradmer Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nPaul Van Damme\nChief Financial Officer\npvandamme@wdcapital.ca\n1.416.847.6905\nAdditional information about Bradmer, including the MD&A and financial results may be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nNEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nBradmer's common shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") or any state regulatory agency in the United States.
