Nash, left, talks with Leanne Kemp, CEO of Everledger, a startup that uses blockchain ledgers and smart contracts to track diamonds from mined rocks to finished jewelry. Photo: Laura Sim / The Wall Street Journal\nIn the latest episode of WSJ’s Future of Everything Podcast , a team of WSJ journalists including CIO Journal’s Kim Nash explores how blockchain technology can preserve or, in some cases, restore the concept of truth in business.\nBlockchain may best be known for enabling bitcoin but companies are testing it to track all kinds of assets, including pharmaceuticals, transoceanic shipments and food.\nOn the podcast, Leanne Kemp, founder and CEO of blockchain startup Everledger, tells of her travels in Mumbai and Seurat, where diamonds are often a family business. Ms. Kemp sees blockchain as an ideal technology to track the stones from rough rocks to finished jewelry so that cutters, polishers and buyers can trust that their pieces have no provenance in illicit activities.\nMIT’s Michael Casey and the WSJ’s Paul Vigna trace bookkeeping from days of usury in Europe’s Middle Ages to Medici bankers in the 15th century to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. a decade ago. Their theory: Blockchain can provide a truth check for companies tempted to cook books – and it’s possible that the technology can eliminate skyscrapers full of accountants.\nTake a listen to the episode that considers blockchain’s potential as a “truth machine” to keep corporations honest.\nShare this: BLOCKCHAIN EVERLEDGER Previous The Morning Download: Facebook Aims for Tighter Integration with the Enterprise Next Companies Grapple With AI's Opaque Decision-Making Process", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T04:42:24.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
