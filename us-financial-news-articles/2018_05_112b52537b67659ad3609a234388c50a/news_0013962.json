But with the latest stake purchase, it has grown to a massive 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion.\nIn February, Berkshire said its Apple stake grew by about 23 percent since the end of September to roughly 165.3 million shares.\nRecently, Berkshire almost sold out its entire investment in IBM Corp and at the same time bought more Apple shares.\n\"They are two different types of decisions. And I was wrong on the first one (IBM), and we'll find out whether I'm right or wrong on the second (Apple),\" Buffett had said a year ago.\nThere may also be another reason for the investment: Berkshire's cash pile of $116 billion.\nThe investment company has not made a major acquisition for more than two years and Buffett had said in his latest annual letter that he wanted to acquire one or more \"huge\" non-insurance companies to reduce Berkshire's cash and equivalents.\nBuying Apple shares partly accomplishes that, even though Buffett would prefer to buy whole companies.\nBerkshire typically discloses its largest common stock holdings and percentage stakes in its quarterly and annual reports.\nThe report for the first quarter is set for release on Saturday morning, just before Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett's hometown.\nUp to Friday's close, Apple stock had risen 9.8 percent since Berkshire disclosed on Feb.14 that it had raised its stake in the company. The shares closed up 3.9 percent at $183.83 on Friday.
