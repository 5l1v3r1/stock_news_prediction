But taken together, financial stability concerns may have increased somewhat,” Handelsbanken wrote in a note to clients.\n“We stick to our conclusion that the key interest rate will be lifted in September, by 25 basis points,” it said, in line with a view expressed by the central bank.\nUnadjusted prices rose by 1.8 percent in April from March. The housing data was compiled by Real Estate Norway, FINN and Eiendomsverdi.
