No new safety signals emerged in the trial.\nRoche has eight Phase III lung cancer studies underway evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other medicines. This was the third positive Phase III study evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination to demonstrate an overall survival benefit for people with NSCLC, it said.\nRoche’s hopes of Tecentriq catching up with rival medicines from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb were dealt a blow earlier this month, however, when it failed a key combination trial in colorectal cancer.
