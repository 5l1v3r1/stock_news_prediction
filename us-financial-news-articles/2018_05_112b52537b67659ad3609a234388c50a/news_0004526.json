(NYSE: ESS) (the “Company”) announced today its first quarter 2018 earnings results and related business activities.\nNet Income and Funds from Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 are detailed below. Core FFO excludes acquisition and investment related costs and certain non-routine items.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n% 2018 2017 Change Per Diluted Share Net Income $1.38 $2.72 -49.3% Total FFO $3.35 $2.95 13.6% Core FFO $3.09 $2.94 5.1% First Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nReported Net Income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 of $1.38, compared to $2.72 in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, a gain on remeasurement of co-investment of $86.5 million was recognized. No such gain was recognized in the first quarter of 2018. Grew Core FFO per diluted share by 5.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017, achieving the high-end of the guidance range. Achieved same-property gross revenue and net operating income (“NOI”) growth of 3.3% and 3.6%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Realized a sequential quarterly increase in same-property revenue growth of 0.7%. Increased the dividend by 6.3% to an annual distribution of $7.44 per common share. Raised the midpoint of guidance for same-property revenue growth for the full-year by 15 basis points to 2.7% and NOI growth by 20 basis points to 2.7%. Revised full-year Net Income per diluted share guidance range to $4.66 to $5.00. Provided Net Income guidance range for the second quarter of $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share. Revised full-year Total FFO per diluted share guidance range to $12.54 to $12.88, raising the midpoint by $0.28 per share, primarily attributable to promote income from co-investments. Provided Total FFO guidance range for the second quarter of $3.00 to $3.10 per diluted share. Increased full-year Core FFO per diluted share guidance by $0.02 per share at the midpoint to a range of $12.28 to $12.64. Provided Core FFO guidance range for the second quarter of $3.00 to $3.10 per diluted share.\n“We have experienced healthy momentum in the early part of 2018, leading to improving revenues driven by occupancy rates across our portfolio. As a result, we performed ahead of the midpoint of initial guidance for Core FFO and same-property revenue growth. Positive job growth in the coastal markets of California and Washington is generating strong demand for housing, demonstrated by extraordinary increases in for-sale housing values and steady rent growth for apartments. Consistent with our first quarter results, we anticipate periodic disruption in apartment pricing power during 2018 from deliveries of new apartment communities offering large lease concessions in certain urban submarkets. We are well-positioned as we enter peak leasing season and remain on track to achieve our 2018 operating plan,” commented Michael Schall, President and CEO of the Company.\nSAME-PROPERTY OPERATIONS\nSame-property operating results exclude any properties that are not comparable for the periods presented.

Generally, FFO adjusts the net income of equity REITs for non-cash charges such as of rental properties, impairment charges, gains on sales of real estate and extraordinary items. Management considers FFO and FFO which excludes merger, integration and acquisition costs and items that are not routine or not related to the Company’s core business activities, which is referred to as “Core FFO”, to be useful financial performance measures of an equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, FFO and Core FFO provide investors with additional bases to evaluate the operating performance and ability of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and the ability to pay dividends.\nFFO and Core FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the REIT's operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Core FFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or financing activities as defined under GAAP. Management has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented. However, there is judgment involved and other REITs’ calculation of FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosures of FFO may not be comparable to the Company’s calculation.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s calculation of diluted FFO and Core FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nFunds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders 2018 2017 Net income available to common stockholders $ 90,918 $ 178,964 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 119,105 115,503 Gains not included in FFO - (112,656 ) Depreciation and amortization add back from unconsolidated co-investments 15,859 12,854 Noncontrolling interest related to Operating Partnership units 3,132 6,146 Depreciation attributable to third party ownership and other (232 ) (25 ) Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders $ 228,782 $ 200,786 FFO per share – diluted $ 3.35 $ 2.95 Expensed acquisition and investment related costs $ 57 $ 556 Gain on sale of marketable securities (680 ) (1,605 ) Unrealized losses on marketable securities 876 - Interest rate hedge ineffectiveness (1) 56 (6 ) Co-investment promote income (20,541 ) - Income from early redemption of preferred equity investments (24 ) - Insurance reimbursements, legal settlements, and other, net 2,433 (25 ) Core Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders $ 210,959 $ 199,706 Core FFO per share – diluted $ 3.09 $ 2.94 Weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted (2) 68,318,012 67,974,466 (1) Interest rate swaps are generally adjusted to fair value through other comprehensive income (loss). However, because certain of our interest rate swaps do not have a 0% LIBOR floor, while related hedged debt in these cases is subject to a 0% LIBOR floor, the portion of the change in fair value of these interest rate swaps attributable to this mismatch is recorded as noncash interest rate hedge ineffectiveness through interest expense. (2) Assumes conversion of all outstanding limited partnership units in Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) into shares of the Company’s common stock and excludes all DownREIT limited partnership units for which the Operating Partnership has the ability and intention to redeem the units for cash and does not consider them to be common stock equivalents. NET OPERATING INCOME (“NOI”) AND SAME-PROPERTY NOI RECONCILIATIONS\nNOI and Same-Property NOI are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. The presentation of same-property NOI assists with the presentation of the Company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. The Company defines same-property NOI as same-property revenue less same-property operating expenses, including property taxes. Please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to NOI and same-property NOI, which in the table below is the NOI for stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Earnings from operations $ 110,547 $ 109,231 Adjustments: Corporate-level property management expenses 7,770 7,509 Depreciation and amortization 119,105 115,503 Management and other fees from affiliates (2,308 ) (2,236 ) General and administrative 14,813 10,601 Expensed acquisition and investment related costs 57 556 NOI 249,984 241,164 Less: Non-same property NOI (17,255 ) (16,596 ) Same-Property NOI $ 232,729 $ 224,568 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995:\nThis press release includes “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
