Photo: Bloomberg News.\nStefan Asenkerschbaumer, the finance chief of German engineering group Robert Bosch GmbH, makes do with a smaller tool kit than his peers.\nBosch relies primarily on its free cash flow to finance growth and acquisitions. The technology group can only access debt and capital markets on rare occasions. The limitation was imposed by company founder Robert Bosch in his testament in 1938 that stated Bosch must remain financially independent. He also stipulated that all company funds have to be spent on the “vigorous advancement” of the Stuttgart, Germany-based firm majority-owned by the Bosch family foundation.\n“Our access to capital markets is limited, compared to other companies,” said Mr. Asenkerschbaumer in a CFO Journal interview last month. “Our priorities are slightly different, because of that.”\nThe capital challenge is well-known to small and medium-size German firms, but rarely to industrial heavyweights like Bosch, with over 400,000 employees.\nMr. Asenkerschbaumer, who became CFO in 2010, has put emphasis on increasing Bosch’s free cash flow and keeps a tight rein on the company’s spending. The finance chief who also heads information technology, accounting and controlling at the company plans ahead for a wide range of scenarios and financial needs.\nSimilar to its competitors Continental AG, Denso Corp. and Magna International Inc., Bosch faces challenges amid technological changes and new market entrants. The company serves as a supplier to global auto makers, including Volkswagen AG. It also manufactures home appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers and stovetops.\nThe company has a long list of capital-intensive projects including a new diesel-exhaust system and spending toward becoming an internet-of-things company offering connectivity to vehicles, homes and factories, Mr. Asenkerschbaumer said.\nThe company is willing to take risks, but only in limited doses, the finance chief said. Between 9% and 10% of the company’s revenues are spent on research and development, amounting to €7.3 billion ($8.7 billion) in 2017. The company on average files 23 patents a day and operates 125 R&D facilities around the world.\n“Closely held companies like Bosch invest more and for the long term,” said Zacharias Sautner, professor for finance at Frankfurt School of Finance & Management in Germany. Nevertheless, the founder’s testament and the focus on financial independence limit the pace of growth at Bosch, he said.\nBosch on April 25 reported profit of €3.2 billion on revenue of €78.1 billion for 2017, up from €2.3 billion on revenue of €73.1 billion in 2016. Free cash flow was €8.4 billion, while Bosch’s liquidity stood at €16.5 billion. Bosch focuses on long-term investments that yield returns of roughly 7% or more a year, Mr. Asenkerschbaumer said.\nThe financial mandate hasn’t curbed the company’s growth prospects, the finance chief said. Bosch currently is building a semiconductor factory in Dresden, Germany, for roughly €1 billion. It has spent around €5 billion on mergers and acquisitions during the past four years.\nStill, the company has had to resort to tapping capital markets though its debt levels are limited. Net debt was €5.7 billion at the end of 2017, €1.3 billion lower than at the end of 2016.\nThe company issues commercial paper as needed, but doesn’t have bank loans, the CFO said. Bosch last raised debt in 2014 when it issued €250 million in eurobonds with a coupon of 2.95%.\n“At the moment, we don’t plan to issue new bonds,” Mr. Asenkerschbaumer said.\nShare this: ROBERT BOSCH GMBH Previous CFO Moves: MetLife, Honeywell International, Lloyd's of London Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Talent Shortages Create Risk of Missed Opportunities: CFO Signals Anticipating higher investment post tax reform, North American CFOs voiced very strong internal concerns about driving initiatives and securing the talent they need, according to Deloitte’s first-quarter 2018 CFO Signals™ survey. Talent concerns have topped CFOs’ list of internal risks for many quarters, and their focus on talent acquisition, quality, and retention seems to have intensified. Despite talent constraints, 69% of the 155 CFOs responding to the survey say now is a good time to be taking greater risk—up from 63% in Q4 2017, and a new survey high.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
