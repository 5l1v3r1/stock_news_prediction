The replay dial-in numbers are (877) 344-7529 from the U.S., (855)-669-9658 from Canada and (412) 317-0088 for international callers. Replay listeners must provide the passcode 10120055.\nN on-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in this release: revenue growth rate at constant currency, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted income from operations and adjusted operating margin, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS). The Company provides revenue growth rates in constant currency to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. To calculate revenue growth rates in constant currency, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: acquisition costs related to the Company’s acquisitions of Atoll GmbH, TangenX Technology Corporation, and Spectrum Lifesciences, LLC (formerly known as Spectrum, Inc., inventory step-up charges related to the acquisition of Spectrum, intangible amortization costs, non-cash interest expense, and in the case of EBITDA, cash interest expense related to the Company’s May 2016 convertible debt issuance. Also excluded are tax benefits associated with valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, the impact on tax of intangible amortization, tax benefits associated with variable integration expenses and tax benefits associated with tax reform. These costs are excluded because management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financial measures is included as an attachment to this press release. When analyzing the Company’s operating performance and guidance investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as substitutable for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Repligen Corporation\nRepligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) is a global bioprocessing company that develops and commercializes highly innovative products that deliver cost and process efficiencies to biological drug manufacturers worldwide.
