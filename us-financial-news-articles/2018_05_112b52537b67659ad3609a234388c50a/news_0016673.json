Japanese markets were closed from Wednesday through Friday.\nLiquid stocks such as Monex Group attracted buying by retail investors, surging 5.2 percent and was the most traded stock by turnover.\nDefensive stocks which include utilities also gained, with Tokyo Electric Power Co up 4.6 percent and Chubu Electric Power 2.7 percent higher.\nOn the other hand, financial firms, which hunt for higher-yielding products such as foreign bonds, stumbled after U.S. Treasury yields dropped to multiweek lows on Friday, before ending flat.\nThe securities sector fell 1.3 percent and was the worst performer on the board, while insurers dropped 0.9 percent. Nomura Holdings slumped 2.2 percent and T&D Holdings declined 2.5 percent.\nMining shares outperformed, with Inpex rising 0.9 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration gaining 1.2 percent after oil prices surged as a deepening economic crisis in Venezuela threatened the country’s already tumbling oil supply.
