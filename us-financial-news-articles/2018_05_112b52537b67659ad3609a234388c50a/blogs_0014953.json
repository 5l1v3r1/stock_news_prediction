To change the perception, they're looking to raise the bar on what he calls a lack of quality research on the short-side.\nAmong the companies he's short is Tootsie Roll Industries, which represents a \"classic short\" with declining sales and earnings, and rising business costs.\n\"It's a product that resonated with our grandparents and not with the current generation,\" Axler said. \"Candy has come under fire for being unhealthy, dentists don't recommend it, there's no analysts that cover it.\"\nTootsie Roll did not immediately return a call for comment.\nAlthough he's not short Tesla , he would consider it in the future and it fits the mold for an investor base that \"might not be seeing the economic realities.\"\n\"Tesla investors that have bought into the dream, are seeing that sometimes managers are unable to fulfill the dream, and sometimes stocks do go down,\" he said.\nThe company reported a narrower-than-expected loss on Wednesday, and the electric car maker has been burning through cash to make gains in Model 3 production.\n", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/search?q=tesla+earnings+cnbc&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS764US764&oq=tesla+earnings+cnbc&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j69i60.2639j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"], "published": "2018-05-03T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T00:56:57.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
