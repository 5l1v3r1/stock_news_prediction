It was not possible to verify the authenticity of the recordings.\nEven small protests have been rare in Egypt since the army ousted President Mohamed Mursi, an Islamist, in 2013 following protests against his rule. A law passed in 2013 forbids demonstrations not approved by the Interior Ministry.\nThe fare rises came as Egypt pushes ahead with tough reforms tied to a $12 billion International Monetary Fund agreement that have included energy subsidy cuts and tax hikes and are aimed at boosting growth.\nThe metro system has accumulated losses of 618 million pounds ($34 million), state news agency MENA reported.\nThe government angered Cairo residents, already hit by a sharp rise in living costs, when it doubled the price of metro tickets last year for millions of commuters.
