In-play, King says, could open the door to a lot more profit, especially in sports, like tennis where there are more opportunities to bet.\n\"If you think about the traditional sports book experience, a lot of it is pre-play, or betting on it before it happens,\" King said.\n\"The innovation that is going to come into the U.S., we think, will be around in-play or cash-out functionality over time,\" he added.\nThese capabilities already exist in Europe, where tennis is wildly popular.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled that states can legalize sports betting , breaking up Nevada's monopoly on the practice.\nFanDuel, which operates a web-based fantasy sports game with more than 6 million registered users, is gearing up for when the legal sports betting industry comes online.\n\"We are working with the regulators on what state regulation will look like. Suffice to say, we have the product design, we have our tech team working — we will be ready to go,\" King said.\nDisclosure: CNBC parent Comcast and NBC Sports are investors in FanDuel.
