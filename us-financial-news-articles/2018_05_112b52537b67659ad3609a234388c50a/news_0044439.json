Higher carbon tax rates in Alberta and France also contributed to the growth in value, the report said.\nHowever, carbon prices are generally still way below the $40-80 per ton range thought to be necessary in 2020 to help meet a goal to limit the global average temperature rise.\nCurrently, around half of the emissions covered by carbon pricing initiatives are priced at less than $10 a ton, the report said.\n“Looking ahead, this trend is set to continue, as indicated by some of the jurisdictions which are planning carbon price increases,” the World Bank said.\n“This includes emerging carbon pricing initiatives, which are launching at relatively low price levels, with the intention of scaling up over time,” it added.\nGovernments raised around $33 billion in carbon pricing revenues in 2017, compared with $22 billion the previous year, the report said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:29:22.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
