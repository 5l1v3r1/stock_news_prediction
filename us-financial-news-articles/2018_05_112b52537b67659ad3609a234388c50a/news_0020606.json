Exposure to very high levels of the gas, which causes acid rain, can be life-threatening, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.\nEmergency teams donned gas masks and went door-to-door evacuating residents who returned to the Laipuna Gardens neighborhood east of Kilauea after the initial eruption to care for homes, pets and livestock.

He was asleep on the couch in his home when a fissure opened up 2,000 feet (610 meters) away, spewing out lava and gas.\n“It sounded like 10 or 20 jet engines,” said Nail, 57, who had recently retired to the area from Orange County, California.\nNail said he had seen drone footage showing lava flowing up his driveway, causing two propane tanks to explode. The blast left his house standing, but Nail said he did not know if it had been gutted by fire.\nHe tried to reach his house on Tuesday, but he and neighbors were stopped by a 20-foot (6-meter) tall pile of lava.\n“All we could do was sit there and cry,” he said.\nFourteen fissures have opened since Kilauea started spraying fountains of lava up to 300 feet (90 meters) from the vents. Slideshow (3 Images)\nAbout 104 acres (42 hectares) of land have been covered with lava since Thursday.\nKilauea has been in a state of nearly constant eruption since 1983.
