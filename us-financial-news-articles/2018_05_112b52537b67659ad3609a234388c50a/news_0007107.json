Kinder Morgan Canada has stopped non-essential work on its Trans Mountain expansion in face of opposition from the province of British Columbia, while Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 replacement is facing new hurdles in Minnesota.\nWilliams said he had spoken with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the importance of getting those pipeline built and was confident that two projects, along with others moving crude south, will move ahead.\n“I don’t think in the last five years I’ve had a higher degree of confidence that these lines are going to be built,” he said. “So I’m greatly encouraged.”\nSuncor shares were up 0.5 percent at C$49.10 on Wednesday morning.
