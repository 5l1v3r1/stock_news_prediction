Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a research note.\nBioMarin said Palynziq is the first approved enzyme substitution therapy to target the underlying cause of phenylketonuria, or PKU, by helping the body to break down phenylalanine, an amino acid found in protein-rich foods such as meat, dairy and eggs.\nThe FDA approved Palynziq for adults who have unontrolled concentrations of phenylalanine above a specific threshold despite other treatments. The drug can cause a severe allergic reaction, the company said.\nAbout 11,000 people are living with PKU in the United States, according to BioMarin. Infants are screened at birth for the condition to make sure they are diagnosed and treated early.\nIf left untreated, the inherited disease can cause brain damage, leading to seizures, mental disorders and other neurological complications. Patients are treated throughout their lives, including a restricted diet.\nWall Street analysts, on average, expected sales of Palynziq to reach $620 million a year by 2024, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAn older BioMarin drug for PKU, Kuvan, works by increasing activity of an enzyme that helps to reduce levels of phenylalanine in the blood.
