(NYSE: DSW), a leading branded footwear and accessories retailer, announced financial results for the three months ended May 5, 2018, compared to the three months ended April 29, 2017.\nRoger Rawlins, Chief Executive Officer stated, \"We are pleased this quarter to report our second consecutive positive comp for DSW Inc. and the fourth positive footwear comp in the DSW brand. With our solid first quarter results, we have delivered a 4% revenue increase and a 16% earnings increase over the last twelve months, marking an exciting return to growth for the DSW brand.\"\n\"Furthermore, we launched a new integrated and cross-channel loyalty program a few weeks ago, reaching an important milestone in DSW's history. We are pleased with the customer response to DSW VIP, which delivers a simpler points system and new benefits like shoe donations, free shipping and points gifting. We remain committed to innovating our customer experience with initiatives that will elevate Designer Shoe Warehouse and drive customer acquisition and loyalty for years to come,\" Mr. Rawlins added.\nFirst Quarter Operating Results\nTotal revenue increased by 2.9% to $712 million, including $5.6 million from residual Ebuys operations. Comparable sales for operations for the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018 increased 2.2% over the same 13-week period ended May 6, 2017. Reported gross profit, as a percentage of sales, increased by 40 bps due to the wind down of Ebuys. Reported operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased by 100 bps, driven by marketing investments, Ebuys exit costs and transaction expenses with the acquisition of Town Shoes. Reported net income was $24.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, including net after-tax charges totaling $7.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, related to the exit of Ebuys, foreign exchange losses and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Town Shoes. Adjusted net income was $31.5 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, including a loss of $0.04 per share from residual Ebuys operations, which the Company exited at the end of the first quarter.\nCompleted the Acquisition of Town Shoes\nOn May 10, 2018, the Company completed the purchase of its remaining stake in Town Shoes of Canada for CAD 44.7 million (USD $35 million). The Company appointed William Jordan, Chief Administrative Officer of DSW Inc., as President of Town Shoes. The Company is in the process of conducting a comprehensive review of the Town Shoes business and will provide future expectations for this business on its Second Quarter Earnings Conference.\nFirst Quarter Balance Sheet Highlights\nCash and investments totaled $269 million compared to $254 million in the first quarter last year. Inventories were $540 million compared to $575 million last year and decreased slightly on a cost per square foot basis.\nImplementation of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nStarting with the first quarter of 2018, the Company implemented the new revenue recognition standard, which primarily affects the timing of the recording of gift card breakage and deferred revenue from the Company's loyalty program, as well as changes within the reclassification of these items on the Company's financial statements. Prior year's results have been retroactively restated in this press release to ensure the comparability of results, with additional details to be provided in the Company's quarterly 10-Q filing. The adoption of this new standard had an immaterial impact on the Company's results for the first quarter of 2017 and the fiscal year 2017.\nRegular Dividend\nDSW Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend will be paid on July 5, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 21, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Annual Outlook\nThe Company maintained its full year outlook for adjusted earnings in the range of $1.52 to $1.67 per diluted share.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nThe Company is hosting a conference call today at 8:30 am Eastern Time.

The unaudited reconciliation of adjusted results should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that this non-GAAP information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate the Company's operating performance, when reviewed in conjunction with the Company's GAAP statements. These amounts are not determined in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be used exclusively in evaluating the Company's business and operations.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dsw-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300656097.html\nSOURCE DSW Inc.", "external_links": ["http://m.dsw.com/", "http://www.dswinc.com/", "http://dswinc.investorroom.com/", "http://twitter.com/DSWShoeLovers", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dsw-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300656097.html", "http://www.facebook.com/DSW", "http://www.dsw.com/"], "published": "2018-05-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T18:14:25.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
