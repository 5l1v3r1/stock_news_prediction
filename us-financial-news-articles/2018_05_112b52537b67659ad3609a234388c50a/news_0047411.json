On the other hand, the working group has not identified issues allowing it to conclude at present that introducing a CBDC can be ruled out,” Norges Bank added.\nAn underlying premise for its work is that the existence and scope of a CBDC must not impair the ability of banks and other financial institutions to provide credit, the central bank said.\nThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in March warned central banks to think hard about potential risks and spillovers before issuing their own cryptocurrencies.
