May 20, 2018; Cincinnati, OH, USA; Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Yu Darvish throws against the Cincinnati Reds during the first inning at Great American Ball Park. Mandatory Credit: David Kohl-USA TODAY Sports\nThe move is retroactive to May 23. Left-hander Randy Rosario was recalled from Triple-A Iowa in a corresponding move. Tyler Chatwood will move up a day to take Darvish’s scheduled turn in the rotation Sunday, with Monday’s starter in Pittsburgh to be determined.\nDarvish was placed on the DL on May 7 due to a bout with the flu. He returned May 15 to pitch four innings against the Atlanta Braves before allowing just one run in six innings and picking up his first win of the season against the Cincinnati Reds last Sunday.\nDarvish, 31, has mostly struggled this season after signing a six-year, $126 million deal with the Cubs late in the offseason. He has a 1-3 record and a 4.95 ERA in eight starts.\n—The St. Louis Cardinals placed relief pitcher Greg Holland on the 10-day disabled list with right hip impingement in the midst of the three-time All-Star’s career-worst season.\nHolland, 32, is 0-2 with a 9.45 ERA in 18 appearances a season removed from finishing 2017 tied for a National League-best 41 saves while with the Colorado Rockies. The right-hander, who saved 40 or more games three times in his past four seasons entering this year, has seen his ERA nearly double by allowing two runs in each of his last four outings.\nThe eight-year veteran signed a one-year, $14 million deal this offseason to join the Cardinals after spending an All-Star season with the Rockies in 2017.\nTo take Holland’s place on the roster, the Cardinals reinstated left-hander Tyler Lyons from the DL. The team also reinstated catcher Carson Kelly (hamstring) from the DL on Saturday and sent Steven Baron to Triple-A Memphis in a corresponding move. —\nCleveland Indians left-handed reliever Andrew Miller, suffering from inflammation in his right knee, was placed on the 10-day disabled list.\nThe two-time All-Star Miller, who turned 33 on Monday, was placed on the DL twice last season because of patellar tendinitis in that same knee. To fill Miller’s spot, Cleveland recalled right-hander Evan Marshall from Triple-A Columbus.\nPer MLB.com, Indians manager Terry Francona told reporters that Miller’s knee has given the lefty trouble “the entire time” this season. The 13-year veteran has not been himself in 2018, with an ERA almost three runs higher (4.40) than his 2016 (1.45) and 2017 (1.44) campaigns, which both earned Miller All-Star recognition.\n—The Miami Marlins placed veteran third baseman Martin Prado on the 10-day disabled list with a strained left hamstring, the team announced.\nThe 34-year-old Prado suffered the injury on Friday while running out a grounder against the Washington Nationals. The injury comes after Prado missed the first four weeks of the season due to a knee injury. He is batting just .194 in 24 games. Miami manager Don Mattingly suggested that Prado could be sidelined for an extended period.\nThe Marlins recalled infielder J.T. Riddle from Triple-A New Orleans to fill the roster spot.\n—The Colorado Rockies recalled infielder Ryan McMahon, who batting seventh and started at second base against the Cincinnati Reds.\nMcMahon, 23, is back with the Rockies after making the team’s Opening Day roster. He struggled to begin the season, hitting .180 in his first 50 at-bats before being optioned to Albuquerque at the start of this month. With Albuquerque, McMahon, who is regarded as one of the team’s top prospects, hit .253 with three home runs and 16 RBIs.\nTo make room for McMahon on the roster, infielder Pat Valaika was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque. The Rockies’ everyday second baseman, DJ LeMahieu, is on the disabled list with a left thumb sprain.\n—The Oakland Athletics placed right-handed reliever Santiago Casilla on the 10-day disabled list with a strained right shoulder, the team announced.\nCasilla left Friday’s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks with a trainer after recording two outs in the eighth inning. He told reporters through an interpreter that his shoulder had been “a little bit tight” as he was getting loose, and that it feels similar to something that bothered him during spring training.\nCasilla, 37, has posted a 3.32 ERA through 21 2/3 innings of work this season, allowing 11 hits and 14 walks while striking out 14. The A’s also optioned right-handed pitcher Josh Lucas to Triple-A Nashville and recalled right-handers Chris Bassitt and Carlos Ramirez from the same affiliate.\n—The Pittsburgh Pirates activated center fielder Starling Marte from the disabled list prior to the game against the St. Louis Cardinals.\nMarte has been sidelined since suffering an oblique strain on May 15. Instead of optioning prized outfield prospect Austin Meadows back to the minors, Pittsburgh instead demoted first baseman Jose Osuna. Meadows entered the day batting .448 with three homers and five RBIs in 29 at-bats during his initial big league stint. He was recalled when Marte went on the DL.\nPirates manager Clint Hurdle told reporters that Meadows will be the team’s fourth outfielder and will see time at all three positions. Meadows didn’t start against the Cardinals. He was the ninth overall pick in the 2013 draft.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T06:48:01.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
