(OTC PINK: SDVI) today announced that its revenues increased to around $75k in Q1 2018, which is a 50% increase in revenues vs Q4 of 2017. The company also announced that it reached near break even for the quarter in net revenue.\nInnovo Technology’s second year as a public company is off to a great start without even going into full production of its flagship Morpheus Pro product line or the full launch of the innovative Knoton.\nThe company spent 2017 focusing on further developing the award-winning Morpheus products that generated a net positive income in Q3 2017, while hitting $140k total revenue in 2017. The company has already generated 50% of total revenue of 2017 in Q1 of 2018 and has lots of big plans for the rest of the year. “Innovo Technologies is a start-up in every sense and because we are public, our value isn’t nearly where it should be. Private companies in our space see valuations 20-30 times where we are currently. However, we are uniquely positioned for explosive growth once we secure the necessary resources for the planned expansion” said Inas Azzam, CEO of Signature Devices.\nMost recently, Innovo announced the launch of a kickstarter campaign focused on its most innovative product to date, the Knoton; a highly customizable IoT device focused on school safety, personal security and blockchain-based secure transactions.\nThe full report will be filed on 5/15/2018 and will be available at https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SDVI/disclosure\nYou can also follow the company on Twitter for small updates and announcements, https://twitter.com/SignatureDevice\nAbout Innovo Technology, Inc.\nBased in Irvine, California, Innovo Technology combines the best of the technologies underpinning the popular Morpheus media server, Tazerwear's AI Software, Truck IT's beacon platform with Knoton's hardware, infrastructure and software. The result is a company that blends custom software and powerful hardware IoT-interconnected devices.
