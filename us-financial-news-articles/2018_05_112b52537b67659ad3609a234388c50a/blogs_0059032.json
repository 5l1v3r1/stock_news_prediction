AT&T is fighting the suit and has resisted suggestions that it sell off some units to win regulatory approval. President Trump has lobbied against AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, which owns CNN, a frequent target of his attacks. tweet\nStephenson said he was pursuing the tie-up because AT&T believes that vertically integrated companies, which own both the content and the pipes through which the content flows, are the only way to win against tech giants like Amazon and Apple .\nMedia companies who distribute their content through multiple channels, like Time Warner does today, lack a \"direct relationship with the customer,\" which makes it harder for them to sell premium content and the targeted advertising that marketers have grown to expect from online players.\nStephenson said that by combining distribution and content, a company like AT&T should be able to offer more effective ads, and thereby lower the number of ads it has to show, leading to a better experience for consumers. show chapters 1:58 PM ET Mon, 30 April 2018 | 03:16\n\"The model has to change,\" he said. \"Premium content consumption is going up, and advertisers love the premium content platforms, they just want it to be more targeted and more effective.\"\nStephenson declined to address whether the company has a plan B if the Time Warner deal is blocked. A judge will decide whether to approve it next month.
