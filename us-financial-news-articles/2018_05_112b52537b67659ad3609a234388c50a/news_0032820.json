Manafort chaired the Trump campaign for three months before resigning in August 2016.\nBoth Trump and Russia have denied allegations they colluded to help Republican Trump win the election.\nHilary Potashner, a public defender who is representing Yohai, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nManafort’s spokesman, Jason Maloni, declined to comment.\nAndrew Brown, a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, had been overseeing an investigation into Yohai’s real estate and bank dealings in California and New York several months before Mueller was appointed to his post in May 2017.\nYohai’s agreement, which was concluded early this year, included him pleading guilty to misusing construction loan funds and to a count related to a bank account overdraft.\nWhile the deal was cut with Brown’s office, the federal government “can ask for help at any time,” said one of the people familiar with the matter.\nA spokesman for Brown did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\nMANAFORT TRIAL PENDING Manafort is to go on trial later this year to fight the two indictments. The charges against him range from failing to disclose lobbying work for a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party to bank fraud.\nAs a close business partner, Yohai was privy to many of Manafort’s financial dealings, according to the two people familiar with the matter and court filings in the bankruptcies of four Los Angeles properties in 2016. In addition to co-investing in California real estate, the two cooperated in getting loans for property deals in New York, Manafort’s indictments show.\nMueller sent a team of prosecutors to interview Yohai last June, asking him about Manafort’s relationship with Trump, his ties to Russian oligarchs, and his borrowing of tens of millions of dollars against properties in New York, Reuters reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort departs U.S. District Court after a motions hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., May 4, 2018.
