But Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, had threatened to hold up the process, citing the debts that Eletrobras’ distribution subsidiaries, particularly its distribution unit in Amazonas state, owed to the oil company.\n“The contractual instruments in this process will be signed by the parties today,” Petrobras said in a statement, without elaborating on the terms of the deal.\nThe company added in the statement that it will offer more information about the agreement at a later time.
