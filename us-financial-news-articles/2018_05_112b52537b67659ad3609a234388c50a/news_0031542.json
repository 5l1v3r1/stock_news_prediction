Soccer Football - Premier League - Swansea City vs Stoke City - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - May 13, 2018 Swansea City's Ki Sung Yueng REUTERS/Rebecca Naden\nSwansea were relegated to the Championship (second-tier) after a 2-1 defeat by Stoke City on Sunday, bringing an end to their seven-season stay in the English top-flight.\n“It was a great privilege to play for Swansea for five years,” Ki said in a post on Instagram. “(I) Just want to say thanks to all Swansea fans who always gave passionate support to us every single game.”\nThe 29-year-old apologised to the club’s fans for the team’s inconsistent performances over the past two seasons, and backed Swansea to “come back stronger” from being relegated.\nKi joined Swansea from Scottish side Celtic in 2012, making 160 appearances for the club in all competitions and scoring 12 goals.\nHis exit follows those of midfielder Leon Britton and defender Angel Rangel, who both announced they would leave the club earlier this month.
