Werner Baumann, CEO of German pharmaceutical and chemical maker Bayer AG, attends the annual general shareholders meeting in Bonn, Germany, May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\nBayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann again threw his weight behind the deal, despite higher antitrust hurdles and delays in the regulatory reviews, speaking to shareholders at the annual general meeting on Friday.
