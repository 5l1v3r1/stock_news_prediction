It came in way under projections, opening with $84.7 million over three days, and just $148 million globally.\n\"Solo\" represents the lowest opening for a \"Star Wars\" film since Disney took over the franchise starting with 2015's \"The Force Awakens.\" As the first film in the sequel trilogy, \"The Force Awakens\" launched with a massive $248 million three-day total. A year later, \"Rogue One\" debuted with $155 million, while the most recent installment prior to \"Solo\" -- \"The Last Jedi\" -- bowed just five months ago in December 2017 with $220 million.\n\"Solo\" did help land the best domestic Memorial Day weekend since 2014 when \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" was the top film. However, it wasn't enough to land the highest Memorial Day opening. That title still belongs to \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\" which debuted with $139.8 million in 2007.\nThe second standalone \"Star Wars\" anthology film has received mixed reviews. It currently holds an A- CinemaScore, along with a 71% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\"Solo\" was the only wide release this weekend, meaning the rest of the North American box office consists of a series of holdovers.\n\"Deadpool 2\" slid to No. 2, where it made $55 million from 4,349 screens over four-days. That brings its domestic total up to $219 million.\nIn third is another heroic blockbuster, \"Avengers: Infinity War.\" The Marvel and Disney title's scored $21.2 million in 3,768 locations. In five weeks, its domestic tally has topped $626 million, while globally it has made $1.9 billion.\n\"Book Club\" landed in fourth during its sophomore outing. Paramount's latest comedy took in $9.5 million for the three days on 2,810 screens. Its domestic total now reads $34.2 million after earning $12.5 million for the four-day weekend.\nThat leaves Warner Bros.' \"Life of the Party\" at No. 5, with $6.9 million from 2,937 locations for the four days. Its three-day total was $5 million, while its three-week domestic grosses lands at $40.9 million.\nAlso in the top 10 is the little documentary that could-- \"RBG.\" The title centered on the life and career of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made $1.5 million on just 415 screens over the four-day weekend. In four weeks, the Magnolia and Participant Media film has grossed an impressive $6 million.\n\"Solo\" still boosts the domestic box office 23.1% compared to Memorial Day weekend in 2017, according to comScore.
