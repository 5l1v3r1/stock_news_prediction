(Nasdaq:CTMX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing investigational Probody™ therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, plans to report first quarter 2018 financial results on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, after the NASDAQ market close.\nThe company will not be conducting a conference call in connection with this financial results press release.\nAbout CytomX Therapeutics\nCytomX Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a deep and differentiated oncology pipeline of investigational Probody™ therapeutics. Probody therapeutics are designed to exploit unique conditions of the tumor microenvironment to more effectively localize antibody binding and activity while limiting activity in healthy tissues. The Company’s pipeline includes cancer immunotherapies against clinically-validated targets, such as CX-072, a PD-L1-targeting Probody therapeutic, BMS-986249, a CTLA-4-targeting Probody therapeutic, CX-188, a PD-1-targeting Probody therapeutic, and first-in-class Probody drug conjugates against highly attractive targets, such as CX-2009, a CD166-targeting Probody drug conjugate and CX-2029, a CD71-targeting Probody drug conjugate, which are considered to be inaccessible to conventional antibody drug conjugates due to their presence on healthy tissue. In addition to its wholly owned programs, CytomX has strategic collaborations with AbbVie, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer and ImmunoGen, Inc.
