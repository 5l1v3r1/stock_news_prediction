Yesterday the latest EU inflation numbers saw an unexpected decline in inflation on both the headline rate as well as on core prices,” said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, in a note.\nOn Friday solid updates lifted shares in German specialty chemicals firm Lanxess ( LXSG.DE ), British Airways owner IAG ( ICAG.L ) and Swiss drug ingredients maker Lonza ( LONN.S ) to the top of the STOXX, while banking stocks were broadly lower.\nSports car maker Ferrari ( RACE.MI ) rose to a fresh record, up 5.6 percent, as brokers welcomed its better-than-expected quarterly update, providing more fuel to its stock price rally.\nSlideshow (2 Images) HSBC declined 3.2 percent after it reported an unexpected 4 percent drop in first-quarter pre-tax profit due to a surge in investments, although its new CEO sought to cheer investors with a share buyback of up to $2 billion.\nBNP Paribas and Societe Generale fell sharply, down 2.4 and 5.9 percent respectively, as traders and analysts expressed disappointment with a weak-looking set of first-quarter results from the French banks.\nTheir declines kept the French blue chip CAC .FCHI down 0.2 percent.\nStill among financials, however, insurers Swiss Re ( SRENH.S ) Generali ( GASI.MI ) were supported by better than expected quarterly updates, while AXA ( AXAF.PA ) fell 0.3 percent after first-quarter revenues fell 2.7 percent, pressured by a stronger euro which impacted the value of its sales.\nForex headwinds were also blamed by BMW ( BMWG.DE ) for its 3 percent drop in quarterly operating profit. Shares in the German luxury carmaker were down 1.6 percent.\nAir France ( AIRF.PA ) was the biggest loser on the STOXX, down 7.9 percent. The airline said it expected profits to fall this year due to the effect of strikes at its main French unit.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T10:45:43.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
