(TSX: AEF) (“ Acasta ” or the “ Company ”) today announced its consolidated financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided the following corporate update.\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\nAcasta’s results from continuing operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 included revenues of $67.0 million, a net loss of $38.9 million or $0.44 per share (basic and diluted), an adjusted net loss of $25.2 million or $0.28 per share (basic and diluted) and adjusted EBITDA of ($4.6) million compared to revenues of $63.8 million, a net loss of $0.3 million or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), adjusted net income of $3.1 million or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted) and adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Acasta’s results from discontinued operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 included revenues of $22.5 million, a net loss of $129.9 million or $1.45 per share (basic and diluted), an adjusted net loss of $96.8 million or $1.08 per share (basic and diluted) and adjusted EBITDA of ($81.9) million compared to revenues of $29.2 million, a net income of $4.5 million or $0.05 per share (basic and diluted), adjusted net income of $6.2 million or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted) and adjusted EBITDA of $24.5 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. On March 27, 2018, Acasta closed the sale of Stellwagen Group (“ Stellwagen ”), disposing of and derecognizing substantially all of the net assets in the former Aviation reportable segment. On May 14, 2018, Acasta monetized its interest in the Stelloan profit participating notes (“ PPNs ”) for net proceeds of approximately $28.5 million. These proceeds exclude the additional U.S. $5 million in downside protection due from the purchaser of Stellwagen pursuant to the sale agreement. As a result of the sale of Stellwagen and the PPNs, Acasta has effectively reduced its total indebtedness by approximately $68.8 million. Acasta entered into a definitive agreement to sell JemPak Corporation (“ JemPak ”) on May 10, 2018 to Henkel Canada Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (“ Henkel ”) at a purchase price of $118 million on a cash and debt free basis, subject to customary working capital adjustments and indemnities. The parties expect the transaction to close on or about May 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, the Company was in breach of certain financial leverage ratio covenants under its credit agreements. Failure to meet these covenants at March 31, 2018 caused the debt outstanding under the Credit Facility and US Credit Facility (the “ Lenders ”) to be presented as a current liability, which the Company would not be able to satisfy if called by its lenders. In response, the Company sought and obtained waivers from the lenders in respect of such covenants subsequent to March 31, 2018 and also modified terms of the covenant requirements under the Lenders’ credit agreements that resulted in an increase in the maximum permissible debt to EBITDA ratios for the period through the earlier of the sale of JemPak and July 31, 2018, subject to certain conditions.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call:\nAcasta’s senior management will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (E.D.T.) to discuss the Company’s financial and operating results.

All such statements constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law and are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of applicable securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, monetizing the PPNs and statements about other anticipated future events or results, including comments with respect to Company’s future financial performance and condition. Forward-looking statements are statements that are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are identified by words such as “will”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “estimates” or similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Such statements are based on current expectations of the Company’s management and inherently involve numerous risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including economic factors. The forward-looking information contained in this news release is presented for the purpose of assisting readers in understanding the Company’s business and strategic priorities and objectives.

The Company believes that this generally accepted measure allows the evaluation of the results of continuing operations and is useful in making comparisons between periods. Adjusted net income (loss) is intended to provide investors with information about the Company’s continuing income generating capabilities. Management uses this measure to monitor and plan for the operating performance of the Company in conjunction with other data prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nEBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) as recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for finance costs, current and deferred income tax, depreciation and amortization expenses. The Company believes that this measure allows the evaluation of the results of continuing operations and is useful in making comparisons between periods. EBITDA is intended to provide investors with information about the Company’s continuing income generating capabilities. Management uses this measure to monitor and plan for the operating performance of the Company in conjunction with other data prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) as recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the exclusion of certain other income and expense items determined in accordance with IFRS, being the calculation for adjusted net income (loss) and then further adjusting for finance costs, current and deferred income tax, depreciation and amortization expenses. The Company believes that this generally accepted measure allows the evaluation of the results of continuing operations and is useful in making comparisons between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide investors with information about the Company’s continuing income generating capabilities.
