HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. We define HCM Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations, LifeWorks EBITDA, sponsor management fees, non-cash charges for asset impairments, gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary, non-cash share-based compensation expense, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, and environmental reserve charges. HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage HCM Adjusted EBITDA is of Total HCM Revenue. Management believes that HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management.\nOur presentation of HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss), earnings per share, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity. Our presentation of HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by these items. HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance.\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are not defined under U.S. GAAP, are not measures of net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. Our use of the terms HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any charges for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may need to be replaced in the future; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the impact of share-based compensation upon our results of operations; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes.\nIn evaluating HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.\nWe present revenue growth in a constant currency to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed 1.30 Canadian dollar to 1 U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in Canadian dollars and 0.75 British pound sterling to 1 U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in British pound sterling for all applicable periods.\nSource:Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b0a8016f-51de-4bb3-90a5-8fee71051d48"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T00:48:55.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
