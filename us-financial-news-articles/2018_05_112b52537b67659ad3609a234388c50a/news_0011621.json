(1) Subject to the ultimate discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company's management expects to continue to recommend quarterly dividends of $0.41 per share until conditions warrant otherwise. At the end of each year, the Board of Directors takes into account the Company's earnings and other factors to consider whether to declare a special dividend.

The declaration and amount of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\n(1) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the first quarter 2018 dividend will be treated as a capital distribution to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2018.
