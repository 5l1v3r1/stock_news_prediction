It does take parliament to approve it, so there will be a need to put measures through parliament,” Hancock said during an interview on BBC Radio 4.\n“I’m not going to set out an exact timetable because today we’re announcing the decision. We’re going to work with the industry to make sure that that’s implemented effectively.” (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Kate Holton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:28:04.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
