REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar/Files Nobukazu Kuriki, 36, was found dead while sleeping in a camp 2 tent at 7,400 metres (24,278 feet) on the 8,850-metre (29,035-feet) mountain, tourism department official Gyanendra Shrestha said from base camp.\n“Sherpas found his body inside the tent,” Shrestha told Reuters. Details of the incident are not immediately available due to poor communication with the higher camp, he said.\nKuriki had made seven unsuccessful attempts to scale Everest.\nIn 2012, Kuriki spent two days in a snow hole at 27,000 feet (8,230 metres) on Everest in temperatures below minus 20 Celsius. That was when he had to have his fingertips amputated.\nMacedonian Gjeorgi Petkov, 63, died at the weekend climbing Everest, hiking officials said without giving details.\nScores of climbers have successfully made it to the top of Everest this month taking the benefit of good weather, officials said.\nNepal has allowed more than 340 foreign climbers to ascend the peak during the current season which started in March and continues through this month.\nJapanese climber Kuriki Nobukazu speaks during an interview in Kathmandu, August 22, 2015.
