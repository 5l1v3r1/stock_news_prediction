Markle’s Rolls-Royce Phantom IV\nMarkle and her mother Doria Ragland arrived at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in a vintage Rolls-Royce Phantom IV. The palace said the automobile was built and delivered in 1950. It was the first Rolls-Royce of the Queen, and her husband Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. She first owned it when she was still Princess Elizabeth. It is one of only 16 built. Markle arrives for the wedding ceremony to Prince Harry in Windsor on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England.

They arrived in the Queen’s State Bentley, a car delivered in 2002 as a Golden Jubilee gift from the Confederation of British Motor Manufacturers. It’s since been outfitted with a biofuel engine.

They were accompanied by Markle’s six bridesmaids and four pageboys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Three vintage Diamler DS 420s delivered the crew to the chapel door. The cars are semi-state limousines, and have been in service since 1992, the palace said. They were among the last three ever produced. They’re typically used to transport members of the royal family and ambassadors. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge arrives at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle before the wedding.

Harry and Meghan took a swing around Windsor to wave at spectators in an Ascot Landau carriage. It’s one of five in the Royal Mews’ collection. The same type of carriages are used for the Queen’s procession during official visits. Two of the carriages were used in the procession of Prince William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.

The vehicle was originally manufactured in 1968, but has since been converted to electric power. The custom license plate featured the couple’s wedding date: the 19th of May, 2018.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T23:32:10.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
