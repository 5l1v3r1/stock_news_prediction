(NYSE:MWA) announced today that for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended March 31, 2018, net sales were $233.2 million and net income was $10.2 million.\nIn the 2018 second quarter, the Company:\nIncreased net sales 16.8 percent, or $33.5 million, to $233.2 million as compared with $199.7 million in the prior year quarter.\nImproved operating income to $29.9 million from $11.3 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 34.7 percent to $31.8 million as compared with $23.6 million in the prior year quarter.\nIncreased income from continuing operations to $10.2 million from $4.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income increased 24.0 percent to $19.1 million as compared with $15.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nRecorded a provisional one-time income tax expense of $7.5 million for the transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings relating to new tax legislation, and incurred other charges of $1.9 million, which were primarily related to its previously announced strategic reorganization.\nGenerated income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.06 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.12 as compared with income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.03 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.09 in the prior year quarter.\nIncreased its quarterly dividend 25 percent to $0.05 per share and repurchased $10 million of shares during the second quarter.\n“We are very encouraged by the healthy demand in both municipal and residential end markets. In the second quarter, we achieved 16.8 percent quarterly net sales growth, our highest quarterly year-over-year net sales growth in five years, while increasing adjusted operating income 34.7 percent,” said Scott Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mueller Water Products.\n“Our gross profit margin expanded to 31.9 percent in the second quarter as our higher volumes, cost productivity improvements and favorable pricing helped offset higher material costs. As a result, we increased adjusted operating income and improved our conversion margin. We expect our conversion margin will be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to benefits from higher volumes, continued execution of our cost productivity initiatives and improved pricing.\n“Our outlook for 2018 remains positive, with favorable growth in our end markets. For full year 2018, we expect our consolidated net sales to increase between 7 and 9 percent and conversion margin to range between 25 and 30 percent. Moving forward, we remain focused on executing our key initiatives to grow and enhance our business as we accelerate new product development, drive manufacturing productivity improvements and execute our go-to-market strategies as a customer-focused organization. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow enable us to reinvest and grow our business through capital investments and acquisitions, while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.”\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the 2018 second quarter increased $33.5 million, or 16.8 percent, to $233.2 million as compared with $199.7 million in the 2017 second quarter.\nAdjusted operating income was $31.8 million for the 2018 second quarter and $23.6 million in the 2017 second quarter.\nSegment Results\nInfrastructure\nNet sales for the 2018 second quarter increased $29.5 million, or 16.2 percent, to $211.1 million as compared with $181.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and higher pricing.\nAdjusted operating income for the 2018 second quarter increased 25.0 percent to $45.0 million as compared with $36.0 million in the 2017 second quarter. Adjusted operating income increased primarily due to higher shipment volumes, higher pricing and cost productivity improvements, which were partially offset by higher material costs and SG&A expenses.\nTechnologies\nNet sales for the 2018 second quarter increased $4.0 million, or 22.1 percent, to $22.1 million, as compared with $18.1 million in the 2017 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher volumes.\nAdjusted operating losses were $3.9 million in the 2018 second quarter and $3.8 million in the 2017 second quarter.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net for the 2018 second quarter decreased to $5.2 million, as compared with $5.5 million in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to higher interest income this year.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, tax legislation was enacted that made significant revisions to federal income tax laws, including lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, eliminating or limiting certain deductions and overhauling the taxation of income earned outside the United States. In this quarter, the Company recorded a provisional one-time expense of $7.5 million for the transition tax on previously-untaxed, undistributed foreign earnings. The provisional net impact of the tax legislation to date is a $35.1 million benefit, including the benefit of $42.6 million recorded in the first quarter related to remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred income tax liabilities.\nFor the 2018 second quarter, the Company reported income tax expense of $14.2 million. Excluding the provisional transition tax expense, income tax expense was $6.7 million or 27.5 percent of income before income taxes. This rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and discrete items, particularly certain effects of stock compensation transactions.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company sold its Anvil business in the 2017 second quarter. Amounts applicable to Anvil have been classified as discontinued operations.\nConference Call Webcast\nMueller Water Products’ quarterly earnings conference call will take place Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. ET.

These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and securities analysts, investors and other interested parties should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe Company presents adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as performance measures because management uses these measures in evaluating the Company’s underlying performance on a consistent basis across periods and in making decisions about operational strategies. Management also believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company’s recurring performance.\nThe Company presents net debt and net debt leverage as performance measures because management uses them in evaluating its capital management, and the investment community commonly uses them as measures of indebtedness. The Company presents free cash flow because management believes it is commonly used by the investment community to measure the Company’s ability to create liquidity.\nThe calculations of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to GAAP results are included as an attachment to this press release and have been posted online at www.muellerwaterproducts.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain statements that may be deemed “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
