We were caught off guard last time.”\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian leadership at a very high level was involved in the attempt to interfere in the U.S. election in order to boost President Donald Trump’s candidacy.\nRussia has denied interfering in U.S. elections.\nSeveral Democrats said after the briefing that they were worried that the federal government was not doing enough to safeguard elections. “I think there is a lot of concern that we are not up to par,” said Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat.\nDHS said in March it is prioritizing election cyber security above all other critical infrastructure it protects.\nThe agency has said that 21 states had experienced initial probing of their systems from Russian hackers in 2016 and that a small number of networks were compromised, but that there remains no evidence any votes were actually altered.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the briefing the federal government should quickly alerts states if they learn of election system hacking.\nHe also wants a “real-time communications channel” between the intelligence community and technology companies in order to assure that internet firms are notified if evidence emerges that Russia is creating fake Facebook Inc pages or taking other actions to influence the elections.
