Armo's shares were trading at $50.10 before the opening bell.\nThe deal gives Lilly access to Armo's lead candidate, pegilodecakin, which is being studied in a late-stage clinical trial in pancreatic cancer, as well as earlier stage trials in other forms of cancer.\nLilly already has a large portfolio of cancer treatments. Its lung cancer drug, Alimta, helped it comfortably beat analysts' profit expectations for the first quarter.\nThe transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:33:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
