REUTERS/Fayen Wong/File Photo “The producers claimed firmer U.S. spot premiums and tighter supplies due to U.S. sanction on Rusal as the reasons for their stronger offers, but we are not feeling physical tightness in Asia at least for now,” another source at a fabricator said.\nFor the quarter ending June, Japanese buyers agreed to pay a premium of $129, up 25 percent from the prior quarter to reflect the spike in U.S. spot premiums.\nFILE PHOTO: A worker controls aluminium ingots on a conveyor belt at the foundry shop of the Rusal Krasnoyarsk smelter in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia, November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin/File Photo Spot premiums in the United States have more than doubled so far this year, underpinned by a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports to counter what U.S. President Donald Trump has described as unfair international competition.\nThe United States’ move in April to impose sanctions on Rusal, preventing customers with U.S. exposure from continuing to buy metal from the company, fanned further supply worries and drove up benchmark London prices to their highest in almost seven years.\nBut Rusal resumed shipping aluminum to some customers earlier this month following an extension of the deadline for companies to wind down contracts under the U.S. sanctions, sources told Reuters last week.\nGiven the uncertainty about global metal supply, all the sources said they expect “more difficult negotiations than usual” between Japanese buyers and producers.\nThe latest quarterly pricing negotiations began this week between Japanese buyers and smelters, including Rio Tinto Ltd, Rusal, South32 Ltd and Alcoa Corp and are expected to continue through next month.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T13:57:47.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
