To facilitate the sale and address its debt obligations, the Company initiated voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with support outlined in a Restructuring Support Agreement signed by 100% of its first lien lenders and approximately 72% of its second lien noteholders.\nRex Energy's drilling and production programs are operating as usual, and the Company is maintaining the necessary staffing and resources to meet its commitments to gathering and processing partners.\n\"Over the past seven months, Rex Energy has been in deep discussion with our lenders and advisors to evaluate every aspect of our business and take proactive steps to overcome the challenges our industry continues to face,\" said Tom Stabley, Chief Executive Officer. \"We have undoubtedly made progress in addressing the realities of the global commodities market but require a more fulsome debt restructuring to overcome the immense pressures our business is facing. Ultimately, we decided that the best possible outcome was to put our remaining assets into the hands of owners with the financial strength necessary to position them for long-term growth and success. Chapter 11 provides an orderly process to achieve these goals in a way that maximizes value for our stakeholders.\"\nThe Company has secured a financing commitment of $100 million from its existing first lien lenders, which, combined with its normal operating cash flow, will allow Rex Energy to maintain normal operations and meet ongoing financial commitments. In addition, and as is typical in these cases, the Company has filed a series of \"First Day Motions\" that, once approved by the Court, will allow it to uphold commitments to stakeholders, including employees, vendors and service providers, gathering and processing partners, and royalty owners.\nRex Energy aims to complete the planned sale process under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code within the next four to five months. All offers will be evaluated to ensure the highest and best sale agreement is reached. Parties interested in participating in the sale process may contact Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. for additional information.\nThe cases are being heard in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\nAdditional information about Rex Energy's Chapter 11 cases can be found at http://cases.primeclerk.com/RexEnergy or by calling 1-877-870-2280.\nRex Energy is advised in this matter by Jones Day, Perella Weinberg Partners, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., and FTI Consulting.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of federal securities laws.
