Priwen developed a specialty in the area of reliable industrial-grade products.\nWith the rise of the cryptocurrency market, Priwen's emphasis started to shift to mining as of Q1 2017. The engineering knowledge gained from the original activities of the company became transferable and very useful upon pivoting to the cryptocurrency industry. This knowledge base led to the purchase of miners in Q1 2017 and the mining of Bitcoin and Litecoin. During this proof of concept phase, Priwen was able to prove both financial and engineering viability.\nWhile deriving revenues from crypto mining in the low cost environment of Montreal Canada will remain a core part of the business plan, the preceding skillet has led to a firm which can not only be a service oriented company, but also have a product and IP focus. Priwen is developing into an integrated digital currencies company with the ability to deploy, maintain, enhance and build miners and accessories not only with the objective of growing its own mining farm, but with the goal of an offering that makes the company a core player in the crypto mining landscape.\nThe Priwen team consists of both solid engineering and operational talent. This will enable solid execution of the business plan. As the industry grows, it will also permit the company to work with any new trend. Crypto mining and Blockchain in general are high-growth markets, but all while remaining focused, Priwen is flexible and uniquely positioned to adjust to new industry trends, some of which the company already envisions and are preparing for today.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 that are based upon current expectations or beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions about future events.
