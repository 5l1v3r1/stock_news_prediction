Photo: REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nShares of Glencore PLC fell Friday following a report the commodities and mining firm faces a potential U.K. investigation over its prior dealings with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nInvestigators at the U.K. Serious Fraud Office plan to seek formal approval for a full investigation into Glencore’s dealings in the DRC, Bloomberg News reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. Glencore’s stock closed down more than 4% in London trading after falling more than 8% earlier Friday.\nA spokesman for Switzerland-based Glencore declined to comment to Risk & Compliance Journal. A representative of the SFO would neither confirm nor deny an investigation.\nMr. Gertler’s work in Congo and his relationship with President Joseph Kabila have been the subject of corruption inquiries in several countries.\nGlencore bought out Mr. Gertler’s stakes in two Congolese mines in February 2017.\nThe company’s prior relationship with Mr. Gertler has caused other problems: It owes him up to $200 million in royalty payments, according to a February report by a Belgian nonprofit, but is struggling with how to pay him due to U.S. sanctions. The company at the time declined to comment on any potential debt but said it was still considering its stance on its prior obligations to him.\nCanadian regulators are investigating Glencore over $100 million in payments a subsidiary made to a company owned by Mr. Gertler, The Wall Street Journal reported in mid-2017. Glencore declined to comment at the time.\nWashington imposed sanctions on Mr. Gertler in December, accusing him of making a fortune through corrupt mining deals in Congo struck using his friendship with Mr. Kabila.\nMr. Gertler also was a partner with a New York hedge fund that agreed to pay $412 million to U.S. authorities to resolve a foreign-bribery probe. Mr. Gertler hasn’t been charged in that case and denied wrongdoing.\nThe report of the potential U.K. probe adds to a number of challenges weighing on Glencore. The company in April said U.S. sanctions on Russian oligarchs led it to cancel a planned deal with EN+ Group PLC, and for Glencore chief Ivan Glasenberg to step down from the board of aluminum giant United Co. Rusal. The Russian companies are trying to get out from under the sanctions.\n-David Hodari and Scott Patterson contributed to this report.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
