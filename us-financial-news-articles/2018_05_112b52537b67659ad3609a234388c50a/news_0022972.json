Considering that there are potentially many newly eligible debtors, the money may not last long at all and you'll want to be one of the first applicants the Department reviews, said Kantrowitz.\n\"You don't want to be playing a game of musical chairs and be the one left out,\" he said.\nEmily Rose Bennett | The New York Times Many student loan borrowers thought they were paying their way toward student loan forgiveness, only to learn they are not eligible for one technical reason or another. The public service program, established by President George W. Bush in 2007, allows student loan borrowers who pursue government or non-profit public service jobs to wipe out their remaining debt after 10 years of on-time payments.\nIn 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that 1 in 4 American workers could be eligible for forgiveness. But last year, the agency reported that a range of student loan industry practices \"delay, defer or deny access\" to that consumer protection.\nMany students believe they're paying their way toward forgiveness, only to find they hold a loan or are enrolled in a repayment plan that disqualifies them.\nSince the department first began accepting requests in October 2017, some 16,000 people have applied, a spokesman told CNBC. In March, the Department expected just 1,000 people to be eligible for the forgiveness though.\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness program expected to grow quickly Year Loans forgiven 2017 $5 million 2018 $25 million 2019 $250 million 2020 $1.25 billion 2021 $5 billion 2022 $15 billion Source, student loan expert Mark Kantrowitz Nancy Conneely, director of policy at AccessLex Institute, which provides financial education to students and schools, applauded the funding.\n\"This is a great first step in ensuring the program is doing what it was intended to do —incentivize people to work in public service,\" she said.\nBut Jonathan Fansmith, director of government relations at the American Council on Education, said the $350 million is not enough to cover all the borrowers who would be eligible if they were simply enrolled in a different repayment plan.\nSenate Democrats tried to secure $4 billion to mend the program.\nThe \"first-come, first-served\" stipulation, Fansmith added, was also surprising.\n\"You usually don't see that in federal policy,\" he said. \"Loans work like an entitlement.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\nStrong economy could be your ticket to a new job\nIf you're tired of Medicare Advantage, now is the time to ditch\nRetire in paradise: 5 countries where you can live the dream", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:52:22.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
