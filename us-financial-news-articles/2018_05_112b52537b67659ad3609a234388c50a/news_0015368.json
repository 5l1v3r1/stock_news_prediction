Our cash management performed well, reducing debt by $3.0 million in the quarter.\"\nResults for the Second Quarter\nNet sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 11.2% to $27.8 million, compared with $31.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.0 million, or ($0.37) per diluted share, compared with a loss of $1.7 million or ($0.30) per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.5 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nResults for the Year to Date\nNet sales in the first six months of fiscal 2018 decreased 17.1% to $52.0 million, compared with $62.8 million in fiscal 2017.

References to “EBITDA” mean earnings (losses) from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to “Adjusted EBITDA” mean EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nNeither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity, including the Company’s ability to incur and service debt and it uses EBITDA to evaluate prospective acquisitions. Although the Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the reasons noted above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations. Therefore, reviewers of the Company’s financial information should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include:\nNeither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on indebtedness; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects any cash requirements for such replacements; The omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with the Company’s intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA; and Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of operations.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to the Company to invest in the growth of its businesses. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and specifically by using other GAAP measures, such as net income (loss), net sales, and operating income (loss), to measure operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nDollars in thousands Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net loss $ (2,038 ) $ (1,657 ) $ (2,949 ) $ (4,266 ) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization expense 2,128 2,424 4,319 4,939 Interest expense, net 422 525 857 1,189 Income tax expense (benefit) 3 (83 ) (237 ) 244 EBITDA 515 1,209 1,990 2,106 Adjustments: Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss, net (1) (43 ) 12 (80 ) 17 Other income, net (2) (80 ) (107 ) (396 ) (214 ) Gain on disposal of operating assets (3) (29 ) — (1,429 ) (6 ) Equity compensation (4) 47 187 242 345 LIFO impact (5) 63 118 115 225 Orange expansion (6) — 931 — 1,883 Adjusted EBITDA $ 473 $ 2,350 $ 442 $ 4,356 (1) Represents the gain or loss from changes in the exchange rates between the functional currency and the foreign currency in which the transaction is denominated.
