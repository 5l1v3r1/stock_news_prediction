REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo\n“The president agreed that they would get in touch when they are ready,” said the source, after the leaders of both parties met Mattarella to tell him they had not yet hammered out the details of a joint program.\n“The president has no intention of hampering the birth of a government that can last a full term of office,” the source added.\nThe Northern League later announced that on Saturday and Sunday it would hold an informal referendum of its members, in squares around the country, to approve any coalition deal.\nKey points of the deal would include scrapping an unpopular pension reform, tougher rules on immigration, tax cuts and renegotiation of EU treaties, the party said in a statement.\nThe 5-Star Movement has already said it would put any accord to an online vote of its own members.
