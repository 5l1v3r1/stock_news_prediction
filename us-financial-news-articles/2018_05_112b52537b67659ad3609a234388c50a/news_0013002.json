The NOC was not immediately available for comment.\nAccording to a loading programme for Es Sider, the port used for Waha exports, of the fourteen 600,000 or 1 million barrel cargoes planned for May, NOC has ten of them. ConocoPhillips, which has a 16.33 percent stake in Waha, has two cargoes, and Hess, with an 8.16 percent stake, has another two.\nCargoes for the partners in the concession can vary from month to month, with a special department in the NOC deciding on the matter, one of the Libyan oil sources said.\nIn January, Marathon was allocated two 600,000 barrel cargoes, worth more than $88 million at current prices.\nBut from the start of this year, Marathon’s cargoes have been sold on to oil trader Vitol via NOC, the Libyan oil source and trading sources said. Vitol’s deal lasts until at least August, the Libyan source said.\nIt is not clear whether the change in hands of the Waha concession from Marathon to Total will affect Vitol’s contract.\nVitol declined to comment.
