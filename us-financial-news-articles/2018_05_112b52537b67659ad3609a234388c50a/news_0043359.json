Boeing, which sells about a quarter of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers, rose 2.03 percent.\nAlso helping the industrials sector was Deere, which jumped 6.3 percent after the tractor maker raised its full-year earnings estimate.\nApplied Materials dropped 8 percent after the chip gear maker’s disappointing forecast renewed concerns over slowing smartphone demand.\nThe warning dragged down Philadelphia chipmaker index by 1 percent. Intel dropped 1.6 percent, and along with Applied Materials weighed the most on the S&P and the Nasdaq.\nThe financial sector dropped 0.79 percent, with traders citing a combination of a slight pullback in Treasury yields after a four-day rally and the uncertainty around trade talks, despite the progress being signaled.\nJPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America fell between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent.\nAt 12:57 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.52 points, or 0.03 percent, at 24,721.50, kept afloat by Boeing and other industrial stocks.\nThe S&P 500 was down 5.99 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,714.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 17.37 points, or 0.24 percent, at 7,365.11.\nThe industrial, materials and healthcare sectors were the only gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors.\nInvestors have been fretting about the impact of rising Treasury yields and commodity prices on corporate results, with the dollar hitting five-month highs also a source of concern.\nCampbell Soup and tractor maker Deere joined a list of companies that blamed higher raw material and freight costs for a drop in profit margins.\nCampbell fell 12.1 percent after cutting its full-year profit forecast, saying it expects higher costs to weigh on margins.\nThe warning also dragged down shares of General Mills , Kraft Heinz and other food companies.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.06-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded eight new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 130 new highs and 23 new lows.
