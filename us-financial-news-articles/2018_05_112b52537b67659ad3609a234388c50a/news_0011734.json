(TSX Venture:CRU) (OTC:CRUUF) (FWB:SY7D) (the “ Company ” or “ Cameo Resources ”) is pleased to announce the Company’s common shares will be split on the basis of three new shares for each one old share, and will begin trading on a post-split basis upon approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. The forward split is being conducted on a push-out basis. After giving effect to the forward split, the Company will have approximately 44,439,156 common shares outstanding.\nOutstanding stock options and share purchase warrants will also be adjusted by the forward split ratio, and the respective exercise prices of outstanding stock options and share purchase warrants will be adjusted accordingly. Shareholders of the Company, with or without a physical share certificate, do not need to take any action with respect to the forward split. The Company's transfer agent will send registered owners of common shares a share certificate or DRS advice which will represent the additional number of common shares to be received as a result of the forward split.\nCameo is also pleased to announce that it is in the process of applying for a name change. The Company plans on rebranding as “Cameo Cobalt Corp.” to better align with tactical pursuits into the energy metals arena. The name change will take affect upon approval from the TSX Venture Exchange.\nCameo’s CEO, Akash Patel states, “Cameo is equipped with an notable roster of energy metal projects; from the Company’s WRL project which sits on the doorstep of Nemaska’s proposed Whabouchi lithium mine, to the Gochager Copper-Cobalt-Nickel project in Saskatchewan. Cameo continues to expand its project portfolio with undervalued battery metal assets with recent acquisitions such as the Staghorn Cobalt claims located north of the famed Voisey’s Bay mine in Labrador. The proposed name change to Cameo Cobalt Corp. will more clearly illustrate Cameo’s energy-centric mission to both current and potential shareholders ”\nCAMEO RESOURCES CORP.\n“ Akash Patel”\nAkash Patel\nPresident\n(778) 549-6714\nEmail: akashp006@gmail.com www.cameoresources.com\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource:Cameo Resources", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/bb1de202-d3c3-42ff-8d42-32a72821418c", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xi0NAMgWbxiceaLSZWwOBYOBKVI5YJ6fwyldHim_ZNQ44euVueL9_Pg1VzzIQJXYDPMtXP3k2-3f4Vi0yofK7uDStv4I8O2FBmlc2XatWqE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yZGzUNtYCwg34_M53t0vMPgAN6txcg0sVPTxnxeFhsA74-KduvAk3jUYHnEviufLhb1OwwtizO4zsWw1eC6gvtgohnpIr1TOMWClraXa8d4="], "published": "2018-05-03T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:13:05.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
