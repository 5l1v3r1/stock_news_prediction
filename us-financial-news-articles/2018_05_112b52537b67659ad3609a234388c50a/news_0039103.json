This is why we need a consensus,” Makri said in an interview.\n“If we do not reach a political consensus, all options will be then open. We may participate. We may boycott,” he said.\nIslamist parties now play no big role in Algeria where the FLN has dominated since independence from France. The MSP won only 6 percent in the 2017 election and it boycotted the presidential elections in 2014.\nMakri said rising domestic gas consumption eating into gas exports showed that the Algeria need to diversify its economy even if oil prices were continuing to pick up.\nOil and gas revenues have halved since 2014, straining a welfare state used to discourage dissent.\nAlgeria has responded to the economic crisis by reducing imports, a public service hire freeze and postponing some projects to cope with the crash of oil prices.\nBut the government has maintained subsidies of key products such as milk and powerful elites have resisted opening up the country too much to foreigners.\n“The government needs to show very clearly to political parties that it will accept political change,” Makri said.\nMany ordinary Algerians prefer stability after the civil war in the 90s when the elite overturned an election which Islamists were poised to win triggering a conflict with them in which about 200,000 people were killed.\nMakri was undeterred by the apparent modest support for Islamist parties, pointing to Tunisia where Islamist and secular forces rule together.\n“Tunisia is a good sample. When elections are free and fair the winners are always Islamists,” he said. “In Morocco, the Islamists have won, in Tunisia they have won, and they would have won in Algeria if there had been no fraud.”\nEditing by Ulf Laessing and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:04:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
