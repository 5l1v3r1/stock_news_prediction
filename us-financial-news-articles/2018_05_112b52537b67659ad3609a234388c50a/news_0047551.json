Football Soccer - Argentina's national soccer team training - World Cup 2018 - Buenos Aires, Argentina - May 21, 2018 - Argentina's head coach, Jorge Sampaoli, attends a news conference on his 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\nArgentina last picked up silverware at the 1993 Copa America, when Gabriel Batistuta and Diego Simeone were playing.\nThey reached the finals of the World Cup in 2014 and the Copa America in 2015 and 2016 but lost all three, the first in extra-time to Germany, the other two to Chile on penalties.\nSince then they have gone backwards, with the Argentine Football Association in turmoil and three national team managers in three years unable to get the best out of unquestionably one of the world’s most star-studded squads.\nAfter settling on Jorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach who won the Copa America with Chile in 2015, they have yet to find their groove despite having talisman Lionel Messi to call on.\nOne win in four competitive games tells its own story and narrow victories over World Cup hosts Russia and Italy, who have surprisingly missed out on this year’s finals, in friendlies appear less significant than hammerings by Nigeria and Spain.\n“We need to learn from our mistakes,” Sampaoli said after the Spain defeat. “We need to face the music and move on.”\nQuite how he plans to do that remains a mystery.
