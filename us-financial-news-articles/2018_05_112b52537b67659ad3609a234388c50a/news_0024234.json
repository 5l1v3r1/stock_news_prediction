Some died instantly and others were rushed to the hospital,” he told Reuters by phone.\n“The attackers were around 20 and nearly all of them were in military uniforms.”\nBurundi was plunged into crisis in April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza said he planned to run for a third term, which the opposition said was unconstitutional and violated a peace deal that had ended the country’s civil war in 2005.\nNkurunziza was re-elected, but some of his opponents took up arms against him. Rights groups say an estimated 400,000 people have sought refuge from the violence in neighbouring countries.\nGovernment officials and members of the opposition have been among those killed in tit-for-tat violence by rival sides.\nThe proposed constitutional changes would limit the president to two consecutive terms but would not take into account previous terms, potentially extending Nkurunziza’s rule to 2034.\nThree residents at the village who did not wish to be named said it was likely the attack was to warn against anyone voting in favour of constitutional changes.\nBut Bigirimana downplayed that, saying the attackers were not politically motivated, given they targeted three homesteads and killing only women and children.\n“A whole family of six people has also been slain. The attack was not politically motivated but was rather a settlement of a score,” he said.
