Turkey’s lira weakened 0.6 percent on the day and is on track for a slightly bigger fall since Monday in its second straight week of losses.\nAssurances from one of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s top economic advisers that the central bank was doing what is necessary on monetary policy and nobody need worry about any future steps it will take did little to calm investors’ concern about stubbornly high inflation and central bank independence.\nArgentina’s peso is on track to weaken nearly 4 percent in its third week in the red, with markets taking little solace from International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde saying discussions with Buenos Aires on a programme will continue with the aim of reaching a swift conclusion.\nMalaysia’s ringgit, still smarting from the election upset that swept 92-year old strong man Mahathir Mohamad into power, is on track for a sixth straight week of losses with non-deliverable currency forwards indicating further weakness ahead.\nHowever, there was some cheer elsewhere, with both Russia’s rouble and South Africa’s rand on track to snap multi-week losing streaks and strengthen more than 1 percent over the week thanks to the recent rise in oil and commodity prices.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see\nReporting and graphic by Karin Strohecker Editing by Louise Ireland\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-11T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:09:49.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
