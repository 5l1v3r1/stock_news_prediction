To that end, IP confirms that it will not proceed with a binding offer unless it is recommended by Smurfit Kappa’s board of directors.”\nIP, which in March made a cash and shares offer that valued the Irish group at 8.9 billion euros (7.8 billion pounds), tweaked its terms to offer Smurfit shareholders a “mix and match” facility that could allow them to receive a greater or lesser proportion of cash or shares.\nIt added that it would also seek a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) to enable Smurfit Kappa shareholders to share in the potential value created by a transaction.\nIP suggested that the two companies should meet to discuss the potential for the combined company.\nSmurfit has said that IP’s latest proposal failed to value its intrinsic business worth and said it was very comfortable with the position it had outlined to its shareholders.\nA spokesman for Smurfit said it had no immediate comment on Wednesday’s statement.\nShares in the Irish packaging group were down 3.6 percent at 0945 GMT.
