(Nasdaq:UFPT), an innovative designer and custom converter of foams, plastics, composites, and natural fiber materials, today reported net income of $1.8 million or $0.24 per diluted common share outstanding for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. This compares to net income of $2.2 million or $0.30 per diluted common share outstanding for the same period in 2017. Sales for the first quarter, including sales from Dielectrics, Inc. from February 1, 2018, the date it was acquired, were $42.9 million compared to 2017 first quarter sales of $37.1 million. The first quarter results included approximately $1.1 million of transaction expenses associated with the Dielectrics acquisition and approximately $600,000 in losses due to the closure of the Company’s factory in Georgia. Adjusting for the impact of these one-time items, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.41.\n“I am very pleased with our first quarter results,” said R. Jeffrey Bailly, chairman and CEO. “Excluding one-time acquisition expenses and losses related to our Georgia plant closing, operating income rose 33%. With these non-recurring costs behind us, we believe we are well positioned to further improve our results going forward.”\n“As anticipated, our February 1 acquisition of Dielectrics made a significant contribution to our operating results,” Bailly added. “Dielectrics generated approximately $1.1 million in operating income in the two months after the acquisition, while improvements in the balance of UFP’s business helped offset the impact of closing the Georgia facility.”\n“I remain very enthusiastic about Dielectrics’ potential impact on our business, and customer feedback has been extremely positive,” Bailly said. “Dielectrics brings new capabilities and talent that I feel will increase our value significantly to both customers and shareholders. Looking ahead, we will focus on smoothly integrating Dielectrics and realizing the synergies of our combined companies. In addition, we will continue working to improve our overall operating efficiencies and to accelerate our internal growth.”\nUFP Technologies is an innovative designer and custom converter of foams, plastics, and natural fiber materials, principally serving the medical, automotive, consumer, electronics, industrial, and aerospace and defense markets.
