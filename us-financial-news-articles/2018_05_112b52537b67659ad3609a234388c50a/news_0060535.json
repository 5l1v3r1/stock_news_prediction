It operates four bottling plants in Kenya.\nCCBA’s distribution system includes 300 official distributors reaching across the country of 45 million people.\nThe company operates in a dozen sub-Saharan African countries including Ethiopia and South Africa.\nKenya is second in terms of profits to Ethiopia, Wilson said, where the company has plans to open at least four or five factories in the next five years.\nWhile Kenya’s economy offers a conducive business environment, bad rural roads take a toll on vehicles distributing products, Wilson said.\nAnother challenge is electricity, where inconsistent availability of power in some of its plants has forced it to deploy generators, which are expensive.\nWilson urged the government to “look at opportunities to reduce (the cost of) electricity, because it’s a big component of ours.” $1 = 101.3500 Kenyan shillings Reporting by Omar Mohammed; Editing by Maggie Fick and Mark Potter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:02:59.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
