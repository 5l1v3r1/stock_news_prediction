But they noted a more hawkish tone than the bank’s March meeting, when the Monetary Policy Committee lowered the rate by 25 basis points.\n“The governor argued – rightly in our view – that risks lie to the upside,” Capital Economics analyst John Ashbourne said in a research note. “While the rand managed to dodge the dramatic falls seen elsewhere in the emerging market world this month, the currency still poses a key risk.”\nLocal bonds were also firmer on Thursday, with the yield on the benchmark government instrument due in 2026 6 basis points lower at 8.46 percent.\nStocks fell, lead by retailer Massmart, whose shares lost around 18 percent after the Wal-Mart unit reported sluggish sales growth and said a head office move and restructuring would cost 116 million rand ($9.3 million).\n“Whilst the positive impact of South Africa’s political renewal has been good for business confidence, there is little sign currently of any economic recovery amongst our lower and middle income consumers,” the company said in a trading statement.\nMassmart shares fell to 115 rand, its lowest level since December, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe benchmark Top-40 index closed 0.5 percent lower at 50,345.50, while the wider All-share index shed 0.6 percent to end the session at 56,699.20.
