He declined to say whether any customers lost money as a result of the attack.\nThe fraudsters had threatened to make the data public, the spokesman said, adding that the bank was working with the authorities and conducting a thorough investigation.\nBank of Montreal said it believed the attack originated from outside the country and was confident the exposures that led to the theft of customer data had been closed off.\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's fifth biggest lender, said fraudsters contacted the lender on Sunday claiming they had electronically stolen personal and account information of 40,000 customers of its Simplii direct banking brand.\nCIBC said it has not yet confirmed the cyber breach but is taking the claim seriously. CIBC said customers at its main banking division were not affected.\nBoth banks said they were contacting customers and advising them to monitor their accounts and report any suspicious activity.\nOther Canadian banks said they had not been affected.\nShares in BMO were down 0.3 percent and CIBC was off 0.3 percent.\nCanada's six biggest banks have been collaborating along with the Bank of Canada to enhance their defenses against cyber attacks. The Bank of Canada said earlier this month that some attacks would inevitably succeed but it has recovery mechanisms in place to limit the damage.\nCyber attacks are increasingly common.
