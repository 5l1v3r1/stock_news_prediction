The hearings will not only feature businesses facing supply-chain disruptions because of the tariffs proposed for $50 billion of Chinese imports, but will also feature exporters—from farmers to manufacturers—which are likely to suffer from retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports threatened by China.\nThe hearings are part of a busy week on trade for the Trump administration. The team of U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer is also trying to finish negotiating with Mexico and Canada over a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Congressional leadership has set a deadline of May 17 to be notified of a deal that would be eligible for a vote this year, an administration goal.\nThe U.S. business community has often been skeptical of the Trump administration’s trade initiatives, particularly its threats of tariffs, which are being contemplated under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Executives from big companies, from electronics retailer Best Buy Co. to Swedish appliance maker Electrolux AB, have asked to testify at the hearings and are expected to raise complaints.
