Texas hit three home runs, all off Kansas City starter Eric Skoglund.\nRangers starter Mike Minor was the beneficiary of the power surge against his former team. The left-hander improved to 4-3 after working six innings and allowing four runs on seven hits.\nMinor, who pitched for the Royals last season out of the bullpen, tied his second-longest outing of the season. His 99 pitches (66 for strikes) were also his second-highest total of the season.\nThe Royals had their season-high three-game winning streak, all coming on the road, snapped. Kansas City also lost for the ninth time in its last 10 games at Texas’ park.\nMike Moustakas did give the visitors an early lead with his 11th home run, a two-run shot down the right field line in the first off Minor.\nShin-Soo Choo answered for Texas in the bottom of the inning with a solo shot into the bullpen in right-center. It was Choo’s seventh long ball of the season, but just his second in the last 32 games. Choo’s 175 career homers are tied with Hideki Matsui for the most among Asian-born players.\nTexas tied the game at 2-2 in the third after Delino DeShields opened the frame with a triple into the left field corner. He would later score on a groundout.\nJorge Soler gave the Royals a 3-2 lead in fourth with a solo homer, his sixth of the season. But Texas surged back in front on Ronald Guzman’s two-run dinger in the bottom of the inning. Mazara touched up Skoglund (1-5) with another two-run homer in the fifth.\nThe Royals’ rookie starter was pulled when Jurickson Profar doubled after Mazara’s homer with one out in the fifth. Skoglund gave up six earned runs on seven hits, as his ERA ballooned to 6.70.\nThe Rangers added a couple of insurance runs in the eighth off Blaine Boyer. The runs were needed, as Kansas City loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth before Salvador Perez hit a flyout to center to end the game.\nThe series continues with the third game Saturday afternoon.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:40:43.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
