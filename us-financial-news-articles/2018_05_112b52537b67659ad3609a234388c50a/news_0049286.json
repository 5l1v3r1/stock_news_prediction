It booked 29 million zlotys on a bond sale. It also booked a 21 million zloty antimonopoly office fine return after a positive court decision,” Kamil Stolarski, an analyst with Pekao Investment Banking said.\n“It seems that the share price reaction will be slightly positive, but the structure of the net profit rise won’t prompt analysts to significantly increase their forecasts, Stolarski said.\nPKO’s share price fell 6.5 percent so far this year, while Warsaw bourse’s main index lost almost 7.8 percent.\n“It would be positively perceived if the management board declares that the present cost of risk is maintained for a longer period,” Stolarski added.\nThe bank said net provisions fell 14 percent to 336 million zlotys in the first quarter.\n$1 = 3.6416 zlotys Reporting by Marcin Goclowski, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:58:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
