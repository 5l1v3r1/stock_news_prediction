All per share amounts are on a fully-diluted basis.\nAcadia operates dual platforms, comprised of a high-quality core real estate portfolio (“Core Portfolio”), which owns and operates assets in the nation’s most dynamic urban and street-retail corridors, and a series of discretionary, institutional funds (“Funds”) that target opportunistic and value-add investments.\nPlease refer to the tables and notes accompanying this press release for further details on operating results and additional disclosures related to net income, funds from operations (\"FFO\") and net operating income (\"NOI\").\nHighlights\nEarnings: Generated earnings per share of $0.09 for the first quarter; FFO per share was $0.33 for the first quarter Core Portfolio Operating Results: Solid Core operating fundamentals To date, achieved 60% of our 2018 leasing goals based on NOI, representing approximately $5 million of annualized NOI Rent growth of 15.3% on new and renewal leases for the quarter on a cash basis Reported 95.3% leased occupancy as of March 31, 2018 As projected, same-property net operating income decreased 1.0% for the first quarter (excluding redevelopment), driven by the previously-reported recapture of occupancy during 2017 which impacted period-over-period comparability Core Structured Finance Investments: As projected, the Company received repayment of a $26 million Core note receivable in the first quarter of 2018 Fund Transactional Activity: Fund V acquired a high-yield investment during the first quarter for $45 million; Fund IV completed $8 million of dispositions during the first quarter Balance Sheet: As a result of successful capital recycling efforts, the Company repurchased $32 million through March 31, 2018, pursuant to its new share repurchase program on a leverage-neutral basis; As previously reported, the Company extended the maturity of its corporate unsecured facility resulting in reduced borrowing costs and improved flexibility Guidance: Following its strong leasing efforts and its portfolio performance to date, the Company reaffirms its 2018 guidance of FFO per share of $1.33 to $1.45 and same-property net operating income growth of 1-3%, including 2-7% growth in the second half of the year\n“Our first-quarter operating results were consistent with our expectations but, more importantly, we continued to make significant progress on both our immediate leasing goals and our long-term growth plans,” stated Kenneth F. Bernstein, President and CEO of Acadia Realty Trust. “At the beginning of this year, we laid out important leasing goals for our high-quality core portfolio; this leasing, together with two key redevelopments, should drive strong, organic NOI growth over the next several years. In the fund platform, we continue to selectively acquire durable high-yield properties while we watch the disruption in our industry translate into other actionable opportunities. Especially during times like these, it feels good to have significant dry powder, both on balance sheet and in our fund platform, to execute on interesting investment opportunities as they arise.”\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nA complete reconciliation, in dollars and per share amounts, of net income to FFO is included in the financial tables of this release.\nNet Income\nNet income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $7 million, or $0.09 per share. Net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $16 million, or $0.18 per share. The decrease in net income for the quarter was attributable to gains on dispositions of unconsolidated properties in 2017 as well as a reduction in the current quarter in interest income following the monetization of structured finance investments and the impact of the previously discussed recapture of occupancy.\nFFO\nConsistent with our expectations, FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $29 million, or $0.33 per share compared to $35 million, or $0.40 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in FFO for the quarter was primarily due to a reduction in interest income in the current quarter following the monetization of structured finance investments and the previously discussed recapture of occupancy.\nCORE PORTFOLIO\nCore Operating Results\nThe Company's 2018 leasing goal is to execute leases comprising approximately $8 million of NOI on a run rate basis. To date, the Company has executed leases comprising approximately $5 million of annualized NOI at its key street and urban locations on Madison Avenue (New York), Armitage Avenue (Lincoln Park, Chicago), M Street (Georgetown, Washington DC) and Greenwich Avenue (Greenwich, CT). As such, the Company has achieved 60% of its leasing goals at rents in line with its expectations.\nAs projected, the Company reported a decrease in same-property net operating income of 1.0% for the first quarter (excluding redevelopment) driven by the previously-reported recapture of occupancy during 2017, which impacted period-over-period comparability.\nThe Core Portfolio was 94.4% occupied and 95.3% leased as of March 31, 2018, compared to 93.9% occupied and 95.3% leased as of December 31, 2017. The leased rate includes space that is leased but not yet occupied and excludes development and redevelopment properties.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company generated a 23.3% increase in average rents on a GAAP basis, and a 15.3% increase on a cash basis, on 9 new and renewal leases aggregating 66,000 square feet.\nRedevelopment Update\nCity Center, San Francisco, CA. The Company has commenced construction on the 40,000-square foot expansion of City Center, its Target-anchored urban shopping center located in San Francisco. The expansion space is approximately 80% pre-leased, with anticipated tenant delivery and rent commencement in 2019.\nClark and Diversey, Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL. Construction is currently underway on the Company's 30,000-square foot development located at the corner of Clark Street and Diversey Parkway in Lincoln Park, Chicago. The Company anticipates construction completion and delivery of approximately 75% of the total leasable space to T.J. Maxx and Blue Mercury in the second half of 2018.\nFUND PLATFORM\nFund Acquisitions\nThe Company completed a $45 million Fund V acquisition during first quarter 2018 as follows:\nTrussville Promenade, Trussville, AL (Fund V). As previously reported, in February 2018, Fund V acquired a 464,000-square foot shopping center, located in Trussville, AL (Birmingham MSA), for $45 million. The property is 95% leased and its anchors include Walmart, Marshalls, and Ross Dress for Less. This investment is consistent with the Fund platform’s high-yield opportunistic strategy.\nFund Dispositions\nThe Company completed $34 million of Fund dispositions during 2018 as follows:\n108-110 W Broughton St, Savannah, GA (Fund IV). As previously reported, in January 2018, Fund IV completed the sale of another two properties in its Broughton St Collection in Savannah, GA for $8 million. The mixed use properties total 11,000 square feet and are 100% occupied; Bluemercury and Tommy Bahama are the key retail tenants. To date, Fund IV has sold seven of 23 properties in its Broughton St Collection, aggregating 31,000 square feet of approximately 200,000 square feet of retail, residential, and office space.\nSherman Plaza, New York, NY (Fund II). Subsequent to the first quarter, Fund II completed the sale of Sherman Plaza, located in upper Manhattan, to a residential developer for $26 million. Following this sale, Fund II’s sole real estate investment is City Point.\nBALANCE SHEET\nThe Company has maintained its solid, low-leveraged balance sheet by reducing its Core pro rata debt by $19 million during the most recent quarter. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s net debt to EBITDA ratio for the Core Portfolio was 4.9x.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company completed a $500 million Senior Unsecured Credit Facility comprised of a $150 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million term loan. The new facility extended the maturity dates of its prior facilities, and provided a reduction in all-in pricing and improvements to market terms and conditions.\nThrough April 30, 2018, the Company has repurchased $54 million, or 2.2 million shares, pursuant to its new share repurchase program on a leverage-neutral basis, of which $32 million was acquired as of March 31, 2018.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nThe Company reaffirms that its 2018 annual earnings per share will range from $0.37 to $0.48 and 2018 FFO per share will range from $1.33 to $1.45.\nThe Company’s 2018 operating assumptions are reaffirmed as follows:\n2018 annual growth of 1% to 3% in same-property NOI (excluding redevelopments): first half of 2018: (2%) to 0% second half of 2018: 2% to 7% The variability and range of estimates is primarily dependent upon the rent commencement dates of certain executed key leases\nCONFERENCE CALL\nManagement will conduct a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 12:00 PM ET to review the Company’s earnings and operating results.

(b) Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue Common Shares were exercised or converted into Common Shares. The effect of the conversion of Common OP Units is not reflected in the above table as they are exchangeable for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. The income allocable to such units is allocated on the same basis and reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. As such, the assumed conversion of these units would have no net impact on the determination of diluted earnings per share. (c) The Company considers funds from operations (“FFO”) as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and net property operating income (“NOI”) to be appropriate supplemental disclosures of operating performance for an equity REIT due to their widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. FFO and NOI are presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the Company. They are helpful as they exclude various items included in net income that are not indicative of the operating performance, such as gains (losses) from sales of depreciated property, depreciation and amortization, and impairment of depreciable real estate. In addition, NOI excludes interest expense. The Company’s method of calculating FFO and NOI may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs, including distributions. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating the Company’s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Consistent with the NAREIT definition, the Company defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, impairment of depreciable real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. (d) In addition to the weighted-average Common Shares outstanding, basic and diluted FFO also assume full conversion of a weighted-average 4,966 thousand and 4,756 thousand OP Units into Common Shares for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Diluted FFO also includes: (i) the assumed conversion of Preferred OP Units into 499 thousand and 496 thousand Common Shares for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively; and (ii) the effect of 168 thousand and 137 thousand employee share options, restricted share units and LTIP units for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (e) The Pro-rata portion share of NOI is based upon our stated ownership percentages in each operating agreement. Does not include the Operating Partnership's share of NOI from unconsolidated joint ventures within the Funds.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006751/en/\nAcadia Realty Trust\nAmy L.
