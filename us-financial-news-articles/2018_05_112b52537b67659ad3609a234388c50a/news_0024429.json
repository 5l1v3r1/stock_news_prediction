It was the tenth consecutive week that prices were higher than in the corresponding year-ago week.\nThe European Union is by far the biggest export market for Norwegian salmon, buying 82.9 percent of volumes last week, up from 80.9 percent the previous week.\nCombined for China and Vietnam, volumes last week dropped to 88 tonnes from 532 tonnes in the same week last year.\nSeparately, volumes to Hong Kong rose to 257 tonnes last week from 188 tonnes in same week last year.
