variations in demand for electricity and natural gas, including those relating to weather, the general economy, population and business growth (and declines), the effects of energy conservation and efficiency measures, including from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies, and any potential economic impacts resulting from federal fiscal decisions; available sources and costs of natural gas and other fuels; limits on pipeline capacity; transmission constraints; effects of inflation; the ability to control costs and avoid cost overruns during the development, construction, and operation of facilities, which include the development and construction of generating facilities with designs that have not been previously constructed, including changes in labor costs and productivity, adverse weather conditions, shortages, increased costs or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, including any changes related to imposition of import tariffs, contractor or supplier delay, non-performance under construction, operating, or other agreements, operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs, unforeseen engineering or design problems, start-up activities (including major equipment failure and system integration), and/or operational performance;

Additional pre-tax cancellation costs of up to $50 million are expected to occur during the remainder of 2018 and 2019.\n(3) Earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2017 include a $32.5 million write-down ($20 million after tax) of Gulf Power Company's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 as a result of its 2017 retail rate case settlement. Further charges are not expected to occur.\n(4) Earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 include costs related to the acquisition and integration of Southern Company Gas and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include costs related to the pending dispositions of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Pivotal Home Solutions. The costs associated with the Pivotal Home Solutions transaction include a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million.

As a result, Southern Company believes presentation of earnings per share excluding these amounts provides investors with information comparable to guidance.
