REUTERS/Grigory Dukor Warsaw could offer up to $2 billion in funding for such a military presence, according to a Polish Defense Ministry proposal reported by Polish media.\nA government source in Poland confirmed to Reuters such a proposal had been made. The Polish Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAsked about the move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was every country’s sovereign right to take such decisions, but that it would harm the overall atmosphere on the continent.\n“When we see the gradual expansion of NATO military structures towards our borders..., this of course in no way creates security and stability on the continent,” Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Monday.\n“On the contrary, these expansionist actions of course lead to counter-action from the Russian side in order to balance the parity which is violated every time in this way,” Peskov said.\nPoland joined NATO in 1999 along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, and since then many other former communist states - including the three Baltic republics bordering Russia - have joined in successive waves, despite Moscow’s strong opposition.\nReporting by Tom Balmforth and Pawel Sobczak; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T13:22:53.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
