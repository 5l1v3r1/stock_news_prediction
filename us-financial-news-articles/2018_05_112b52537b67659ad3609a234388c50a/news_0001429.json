Escotet lives in Spain.\nVenezuela maintains exchange controls under which the government provides hard currency at an official rate, which is currently 69,000 bolivars per dollar.\nBut greenbacks are fetching around 800,000 on black markets, which government officials have for years harshly criticized but broadly tolerated.\nHyperinflation has turned the once-powerful banks into warehouses of useless cash that are worth a total of only $40 million, according to a recent Reuters analysis of regulatory data.\nThe detentions come on the heels of the shock arrests of two Venezuelan executives working for U.S. oil major Chevron ( CVX.N ) after they refused to sign a supply contract for furnace parts drawn up by state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] without a public tender.
