The Aquarius is setting off again later in the day for the waters off the coast of Libya.\n“Given the weather conditions ... It’s better we’re out there and ready,” she said.\nOn Saturday, the leader of the far-right League party, which appears poised to form a coalition government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, said that the surge in arrivals meant someone was trying to undermine the would-be administration.

Miracle, weighing 2.8 kg, was the sixth baby born on the rescue ship, but the first this year, King said.\nWhen Miracle was brought onto deck by the midwife, the migrants on board celebrated his birth by singing and dancing — a far cry from the conditions they said they had came from in Libya.\nThe mother, whose name was not given, told MSF she had been “held captive, beaten, given very little food and extorted for money for release” during the year she was in Libya.
