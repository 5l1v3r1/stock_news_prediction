She will replace Jim Weddle, effective Jan. 1, as the privately held firm’s “managing partner,” akin to the chief executive’s spot at other companies.\nMr. Weddle, who is retiring, has led the firm for 13 years, overseeing its rise to one of the nation’s biggest wealth-management firms with about $1 trillion in client assets and over 17,000 brokers.\nBy comparison, Bank of America Corp.’s wealth unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, has about 17,000 financial advisers and $2.7 trillion in client assets. Morgan Stanley ’s adviser ranks of about 16,000 manage about $2.4 trillion.\nMs. Pennington joins a small cadre of female leaders atop major wealth management businesses. Valerie Brown was previously CEO of Cetera, the second-largest independent brokerage firm, and is now executive chairman of the Board of Advisor Group Inc., another large independent brokerage. Shelley O’Connor is co-head of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit, and Sallie Krawcheck, CEO of robo adviser Ellevest, ran the wealth management businesses at Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch.\nMr. Weddle said he plans to begin transitioning his role to Ms. Pennington once her position is filled in the coming weeks. He joined Edward Jones in 1976 and worked as a financial adviser before eventually being named managing partner in 2006.\nRelated Coverage\nAs Edward Jones Tops $1 Trillion in Assets, It Seeks Street Cred (Oct. 16, 2107) Edward Jones Looks to Branch Out—in Urban Areas (May 9, 2017) Edward Jones Shakes Up Retirement Offerings Ahead of Fiduciary Rule (Aug. 17, 2016) Ms. Pennington’s appointment comes at a pivotal point for the brokerage industry. Firms are trying to reshape advisers into full-service financial planners, as opposed to brokers who buy and sell stocks and bonds, while replenishing aging, mostly male ranks. Women represent just 15.1% of financial advisers, according to research firm Cerulli Associates.\n“Being a woman in this role isn’t typical,” Ms. Pennington said in an interview Tuesday. “Our industry is recognizing there’s a tremendous pool of talent that hasn’t been tapped as well as it could be.”\nAt the same time, given that wives tend to outlive their husbands, women are positioned to control an increasing share of a $30 trillion wealth transfer under way as baby boomers leave assets to their children. Analysts estimate about 70% of the funds changing hands over the coming decades will be controlled by women.\nEdward Jones said it is hoping to tap that market and many of those potential customers don’t already have advisers.\n“We’re going to where the wealth will shift,” said Monica Giuseffi, head of diversity at Edward Jones, in a March interview.\nMs. Giuseffi has been leading the firm’s efforts to recruit more female advisers by hosting women-only cocktail parties across the country, concentrated in the small and medium-size metro areas where the firm has traditionally focused. “We are not magnetic as we are today. We are not relatable,” she said.\nEfforts to attract and promote more women are paying off, though executives say there is a long way to go. Women made up about a quarter of Edward Jones’s new recruits at the end of last year, and the firm’s top adviser in terms of assets under management is Texas-based Jennifer Marcontell.\nMs. Marcontell, with $1 billion in client assets, mentors young women across the firm and coaches male advisers looking to better serve women.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:05:05.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
