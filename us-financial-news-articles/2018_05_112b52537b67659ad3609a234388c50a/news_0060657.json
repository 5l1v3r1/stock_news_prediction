Grace & Co ( GRA.N ) and Foresight Energy LP ( FELP.N ), according to a criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court.\nGoldman Sachs could not immediately be reached for comment. A lawyer for Jung could not immediately be identified.\nProsecutors said Jung engaged in those trades through a brokerage account in the name of a friend living in South Korea.\nThe insider trading continued until 2017, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested information from Goldman about which employees had access to confidential information about certain transactions, they said.\nFollowing that request, prosecutors said, someone called the brokerage firm whose account was used to make those illegal trades. Using the name of Jungâ€™s friend in Korea, the caller said that the account had been opened using stolen personal information, and he was concerned about the transactions in the account.\nJung is charged with conspiracy and securities fraud. He also faces related civil charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe SEC has accused Jung of making more than $140,000 through insider trading in 12 companies.
