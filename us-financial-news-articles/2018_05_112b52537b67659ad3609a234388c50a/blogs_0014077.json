But they said the president didn't put out the directive as a bargaining chip in his upcoming meeting with North Korea .\nNeither the White House nor the U.S. Department of Defense replies to CNBC emails requesting comment on the report.\nTrump is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in coming weeks to push for the hermit nation's nuclear weapons disarmament.\nKim had earlier met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in , and the two were said to agree to work toward a peace treaty â€” which would officially end the Korean War.\nU.S. troops have been stationed in South Korea since the conflict's armistice in 1953. A peace treaty between the two Koreas could reduce the need for the more than 20,000 American soldiers still stationed there, according to the report.\nTrump has long wanted to withdraw American troops from South Korea, claiming that the U.S. hasn't been properly compensated for its military presence, the Times noted. South Korea, however, has said it wants U.S. troops to stay even if a peace treaty is signed with North Korea.\nFor the full report, see the article in The New York Times.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/asia/trump-troops-south-korea.html"], "published": "2018-05-04T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T06:32:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
