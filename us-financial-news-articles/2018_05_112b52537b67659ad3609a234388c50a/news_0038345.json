Kay Nietfeld/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\nThe four-term German leader said both countries recognised the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and would push for increased multilateralism at a time of rising global concern about protectionist trade measures undermining growth.\nIn a weekly videocast released on Saturday, Merkel said the discussions would also centre on important issues such as the rule of law and ensuring equal access to each other’s markets.\nGerman companies have complained for years about barriers to the Chinese market, and the theft of intellectual property. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency last year said industrial espionage by China, Russia and others cost German industry billions of euros each year.

Merkel travels to China about once a year.\nHer visit this year comes at a time of sharply increased tensions with the United States over its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by six world powers, including Germany and China. It follows her meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week.\nThis time, Merkel will also visit the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, home to several major technology companies, and the cradle of China’s economic opening to the West.\n“For that reason it is also very interesting for me to visit this dynamic city, where many German companies have their headquarters and production sites,” Merkel said.
