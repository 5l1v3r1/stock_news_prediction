But in an email to Reuters it said “we continue to work closely with our investors and are committed to ensure that a positive resolution is achieved for all parties”.\nAbraaj, founded by Arif Naqvi in 2002, has shaken up its management, suspended new investments, freed up large investors from millions of dollars in capital commitments and is reviewing its corporate structure.\nNaqvi remains CEO of Abraaj Holdings, which owns the investment management unit.
