(“Benchmark”) moved to No. 5 (up from No. 6) among the top general contractors for alteration and renovation projects in New York City by the New York City Department of Buildings.\nEntered into agreement with a global tier-1 commercial real estate owner to provide CrossLayer service for their in-building technology and technology solutions. Further details will be announced over the next 30 days.\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter of 2018\nTotal revenue of $85.1 million, up 89%, compared to pro forma total revenue of $45.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, as the Benchmark acquisition was not finalized until April 21, 2017.\nGross margin was 15.2%, compared to 22.2% on a pro forma basis in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $7.4 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 8.7%, compared to pro forma EBITDA of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EPS of $0.56 per share. This compares to a pro forma adjusted net loss of $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“2018 is a pivotal year for FTE; I am excited at the forward progress the Company is making,” noted Michael Palleschi, President and Chief Executive Officer of FTE. “With the successful integration of Benchmark and launch of CrossLayer, we have positioned ourselves in the market to provide carrier grade in-building technology and innovative infrastructure services. Through our two business segments, technology and infrastructure, we have an incredible opportunity to manage the entire in-building ecosystem from design through implementation of data systems and intelligent buildings.”\nMr. Palleschi further states, “This quarter was excellent on several fronts. We experienced strong revenue growth when compared to pro forma results from first quarter 2017, increased our backlog to approximately $460.7 million, continued to expand our pipeline of CrossLayer opportunities, and strengthened the foundation for growth in 2018 and beyond.”\n“We are also pleased to report that the infrastructure segment continues to drive results in the near-term and, based on our current visibility, expect to see revenue growth in 2018. The first quarter declined sequentially due to project timing, but our backlog and current pipeline give us confidence that 2018 will be a strong year. We benefit from a large and satisfied customer base that help drive recurring business.\n“With respect to our technology segment, we are pleased to announce initial revenue contribution in the first quarter as a result of adding buildings on net. We have made excellent progress since launching CrossLayer in the fourth quarter of 2017 and we are on pace to meet our goal of 30 buildings on-net by the end of 2018. The strategy of leveraging our core competencies continues to increase both the quantity and quality of our pipeline. The value proposition brought by the CrossLayer solution is simple and easy to understand for building owners, developers, and managers. CrossLayer enables the above groups to differentiate their properties by offering advanced network services directly to tenants and guests. We continue to expect to see a meaningful impact on revenue in the 2 nd half of 2018.”\n“Overall, we continue to focus on driving revenue growth in the near and long-term. Buoyed by the exciting CrossLayer solution, the Company is energized and well on its way to realizing its growth goals while maximizing shareholder value.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $85.1 million.\nConsolidated gross margin was 15.2%, compared to pro forma gross margin of 22% for the first quarter 2017. Benchmark’s gross margin is lower than FTE’s legacy network unit.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter 2018 were $11.3 million, compared to pro forma operating expenses of $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in expenses is primarily attributable to higher stock compensation expense and increased amortization expense of intangible assets.\nOperating income was approximately $0.2 million in first quarter of 2018, which included approximately $0.3 million in one-time expenses, compared to the prior quarter, pro forma operating Income of $0.8 million which included approximately $ 0.2 million in one-time expenses.\nOther expense for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $9.7 million, compared to $4.0 million on a pro forma basis in the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to one time costs such as the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts, as well as other financing costs.\nOn a GAAP-basis, net loss was approximately $10.2 million, or $2.09 per share, for the three-months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a pro forma loss of $3.1 million, or $1.02 per share, for the period ending March 31, 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was approximately $3.5 million, or $0.56 per share, for the three-months ended March 31, 2018 (See reconciliation table below).\nAdjusted EBITDA was $7.4 million for the three-months ended March 31, 2018.*\nAs of March 31, 2018, combined backlog totaled approximately $460.7 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, FTE had $9.6 million in cash and working capital of $12.5 million.\nFinancial Guidance for 2018\nBased on results year to date, the Company is reiterating its previously issued financial guidance for 2018. Expectations are as follows:\nNet revenue of $350 million\nAdjusted EBITDA of $30 million\nOperating Income of $15 million\nBuildings on-net, 30\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAs previously announced, Michael Palleschi, Chief Executive Officer, and David Lethem, Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call today to review the Company’s first quarter 2018 results, followed by a brief question and answer period.

Management believes that presentation of operating results using non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company's core operating results and comparison of core operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making, planning and forecasting purposes and to manage the Company's business. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to and not as a substitute for the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation, and do not therefore present the full measure of the Company's recorded costs against its net revenue. In addition, the Company's definition of the non-GAAP financial measures below may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures:\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined by FTE Networks as net income from continuing operations before: (i) interest expense, (ii) tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, and if applicable in a reporting period (v) acquisition related transaction expenses (vi) non-cash impairments of intangible assets (vii) debt financing costs (viii) and other significant non-recurring or non-operating (income) or expenses.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited, in thousands) For the Three Months ended March 31 2018 2017 Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) $ (10,183,953) $ (824,716) Adjustments to Net Income (Loss): Interest expense 913,252 819,919 Income tax expense (benefit) 567,453 - Amortization 11,255,316 397,974 Depreciation 437,374 241,394 Financing costs 2,001,671 Acquisition related costs 92,630 226,004 EBITDA 5,083,743 860,575 Further Adjustments to EBITDA: Non-cash stock based expense 2,320,020 189,673 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 7,403,763 $ 1,050,248 Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS\n\"Adjusted Diluted EPS\" is defined by FTE Networks as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding. Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding is the sum of Diluted shares outstanding and the weighted average number of common shares that would be outstanding if the preferred stock were converted into common stock on the original issue date based on the number of days such common shares would have been outstanding in the reporting period. In addition, if GAAP Net Income is negative and Adjusted Net Income is positive, Adjusted Diluted Shares will also include any warrants that would be outstanding as dilutive instruments using the treasury stock method.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income Available to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and GAAP Earnings\nper Share to Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings per Share (Unaudited, in thousands) For the Three Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) $ (10,203,844) $ (844,607) Adjustments to Net Income (Loss): Amortization 11,255,316 397,974 Deemed dividends on preferred stock 19,891 19,891 Non-cash stock based expenses 2,320,020 189,673 Acquisition related costs 92,630 226,004 Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 3,484,014 $ (11,065) Net income (loss) per common share (GAAP) Diluted EPS $ (1.65) $ (0.35) Adjustments to diluted loss per share: Amortization of intangibles 1.82 0.16 Non-cash stock based compensation expenses 0.37 0.08 Acquisition related costs 0.01 - Deemed dividends on preferred stock 0.00 0.01 Impact of including warrants in Adj. Diluted Shares 0.00 0 Adjusted Diluted EPS (non-GAAP) 0.56 (0.10) Weighted average shares used in computation of adjusted diluted earnings per share: Diluted Common Shares (GAAP) 6,200,000 2,418,021 Warrants not included in GAAP Diluted Shares (using treasury stock method) - - Weighted Avg. Preferred Shares (as converted) - - Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding (non-GAAP) 6,200,000 2,418,021 Basis for Non-GAAP Adjustments\nFTE Networks’ basis for excluding certain expenses (income) from GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:\nAmortization of intangible assets — The intangible assets that give rise to this amortization expense relate to acquisitions, and the amounts allocated to such intangible assets and the terms of amortization vary by acquisition and type of asset. FTE Networks excludes these items to provide a consistent basis for comparing operating results across reporting periods, pre and post-acquisition.\nStock-based compensation expenses — As incentive for both employees and certain non-employees, from time to time shares of the Company’s common stock are issued by the Board of Directors. Without adjusting for these non-cash expenses, the Company believes it would be difficult to compare financial results from core operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nDeemed dividends on preferred stock — GAAP accounting for the structure of the Series A and Series A-1 Preferred Stock requires the Company to accrue a set dividend rate quarterly. Since such dividends are not paid in cash, the Company believes these non-cash expenses are not meaningful in evaluating the operating performance of the Company and it would be misleading to not adjust for such expenses across reporting periods.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “believe,” “expect,” “expectations,” “positioned,” “forward,” “opportunity,” “expand,” “goal,” “strategy” and similar references to future periods.
