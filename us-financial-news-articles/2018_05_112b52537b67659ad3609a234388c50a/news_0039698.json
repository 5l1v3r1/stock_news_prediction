However, when toughened sanctions were imposed on Tehran in 2012 to curb its nuclear ambitions, state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was forced to look for other light crudes.\nThe existing refinery accounts for 30 percent of Sri Lanka’s fuel requirement, but the head of CPC last week said that upgrading “may not be the solution” because Sri Lanka needs a refinery capable of handling all types of crude.\nIran’s offer comes as Chinese, Middle East and Russian companies are in “preliminary discussions” to build a 100,000 bpd refinery for CPC.\nTwo Chinese companies have jointly bid for a 100,000 bpd refinery, with annual output of about 5 million tonnes a year, in the southern town of Hambantota, where China controls a sea port and plans an industrial zone.\nSri Lanka is still in talks about the Hambantota refinery, though the government has blocked a proposal by the Chinese companies to sell fuel locally.\nSri Lanka has also discussed another 100,000 bpd refinery in partnership with Indian Oil Corp, but there has been no progress on that plan.
