REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nThe business daily, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said Weimer hoped to achieve the headcount reductions by offering older staff buyouts or early retirement.\n“This will all be cushioned in a socially sensible way,” the newspaper quoted one source familiar with the matter as saying.\nDeutsche Boerse named Wiemer, a former UniCredit banker, as CEO last November after Carsten Kengeter resigned amid an insider trading investigation.\nKengeter, who denied wrongdoing, had led talks on merging Deutsche Boerse with the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) that unravelled after Britain’s referendum vote to leave the European Union.\nHandelsblatt, citing company insiders, said few staff had been offered buyouts while Kengeter was at the helm and there would be willing takers if offers were made now. Deutsche Boerse employs more than 5,640 people.\nDeutsche Boerse declined to comment on the report.
