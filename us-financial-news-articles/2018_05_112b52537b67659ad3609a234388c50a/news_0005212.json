(TSXV:SRG) (“SRG” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that in connection with its marketed public offering (the “Offering”) previously announced on May 1, 2018, it has entered into an underwriting agreement (the \"Underwriting Agreement\") with a syndicate of underwriters, providing for the purchase and sale of 5,334,000 units of the Company (“Units”) at a price of $1.50 per Unit (the \"Offering Price\") for gross proceeds of $8,001,000 (the \"Offering\"). Each Unit will be comprised of one common share of the Company (a \"Common Share\") and one Common Share purchase warrant of the Company (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to acquire one additional Common Share (each a \"Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of $2.30 per Common Share at any time for a period of 12 months following the closing date of the Offering.\nThe Offering is being conducted through a syndicate of underwriters co-led by National Bank Financial Inc. and TD Securities Inc. and including Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd., Beacon Securities Limited and Clarksons Platou Securities AS (collectively, the “Underwriters”).\nThe Company has granted the Underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase up to a number of additional Units and/or Warrants equal to 15% of the Units sold pursuant to the Offering, exercisable in whole or in part at any time up to 30 days after and including the closing date of the Offering, which may be exercised for Units, Warrants or a combination thereof.\nIn addition, the Company intends to complete a concurrent non-brokered private placement with Coris Capital SA (“Coris”).

The units issuable pursuant to the Concurrent Private Placement will be on the same terms and conditions as those issuable pursuant to the Offering. The units issuable pursuant to the Concurrent Private Placement will be subject to a statutory four month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws. The closing of the Offering will be conditional upon the closing of the Concurrent Private Placement.\nThe Company intends to use the proceeds from the Offering and Concurrent Private Placement for advancement of the Company’s Lola Graphite project, including, in the near term, to further regional exploration and infill resource drilling and to progress towards a feasibility study; for continued exploration of its Gogota Cobalt-Nickel-Scandium project; and for general working capital purposes.\n“This financing will provide the financial resources necessary to move forward with the development plan of the Company’s two deposits; the Lola graphite deposit and the Gogota nickel-cobalt-scandium deposit,” said Ugo Landry-Tolszczuk, President & COO.\n“We are very thankful to Mr. Nassa and his team at Coris Capital who continue to be great supporters of the Company as we move to the next stage of development,” said Benoit La Salle, Executive Chairman.\nSRG will file today an amended and restated preliminary short form prospectus (the “Amended Preliminary Prospectus”) containing important information relating to the Offering in each of the Provinces of Canada and the Amended Preliminary Prospectus will be available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nThe Offering and Concurrent Private Placement are expected to close on or about May 18, 2018 and are subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSXV\").
