U.S. President Donald Trump holds a Make America Great Again rally at Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S., May 29, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis\nGerman carmakers control 90 percent of the U.S. premium auto market, with BMW ( BMWG.DE ) owning the Rolls-Royce and BMW brands while Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) has Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) controls Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche and Audi.\nThe Trump administration has opened a trade investigation into whether vehicle imports have damaged the U.S. auto industry.\nCiting several unnamed European and U.S. diplomats, the magazine said on Thursday that he told Macron in April he would stick to his trade policy for long enough until no Mercedes-Benz models were rolling down New York’s Fifth Avenue.\nWithin the EU, Germany is the biggest exporter of cars to the United States.\nEU passenger car imports from the United States were worth 6.2 billion euros (5.5 billion pounds) last year, while the bloc’s U.S. exports topped 37 billion euros, according to Brussels-based industry association ACEA.\nGerman automakers assembled 804,000 cars in U.S. plants last year but exported another 657,000 to North America from Germany, according to the VDA industry association.\nTrump is expected to decide on Thursday whether to end an EU exemption from tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminium, a move Germany has warned could lead to a damaging trade war.\nBerlin has also reacted angrily to a U.S. vehicle imports investigation, which could lead to tariffs of up to 25 percent on the same “national security” grounds that Washington used to impose metals duties in March.\nImposing such a tariff would destroy the business case for German carmakers to import into the United States, and cause a burden of 4.5 billion euros for German premium manufacturers, analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note last week.\nLate on Wednesday, talks to avoid a transatlantic trade war showed no sign of a breakthrough.
