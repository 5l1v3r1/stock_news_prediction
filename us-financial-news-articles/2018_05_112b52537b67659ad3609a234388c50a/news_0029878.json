We’re all excited about that,” Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president, said during a press conference last month. “We had a good test campaign in Texas. I believe it was faster than we ever had on new block upgrades.”\nAmong the Block-5 features new to the Falcon 9 series are a heat-resistant layer of shielding at the base of the rocket, reusable tail fins for cleaner return landings and a thrust nearly 10 percent stronger than that of the Block-4.\nBlock-5 marks the final version of the iconic Falcon 9 lineup before SpaceX introduces its super heavy-lift launch vehicle, dubbed the Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, which will be designed to send manned missions to Mars.
