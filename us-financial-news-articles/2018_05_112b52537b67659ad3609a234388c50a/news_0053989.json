A company official said Public Power will address the invitation on May 31, according to the sale’s timetable.\nThe sale is a condition of the country’s latest international bailout and has drawn fierce protest from unions.\nReporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Writing by Renee Maltezou; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:01:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
