Also taking a beating are the Swedish krona and Norwegian krone, down around 2% and 0.8% this month, respectively.\nInvestors have grown increasingly pessimistic on the eurozone in recent weeks, amid signs of slowing growth and fears that the growing political crisis in Italy could mushroom into an existential threat to the currency bloc.\nThe euro fell 0.7% against the dollar to its lowest level since last July on Tuesday.\nThose concerns have also battered the currencies of the eurozone’s neighbors, which rode the coattails of the region’s booming economic expansion in 2017.\n“They were all very heavily dependent on exports to the eurozone, and now economic risks are rising,” said Win Thin, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.\nEmerging market currencies such as the zloty, koruna and forint are also being hit by a broader selloff in the asset class spurred by a rallying dollar and rising U.S. yields, which diminish the attractiveness of emerging markets.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, is up around 4% in the last three months.\nInvestors will be keeping an eye on U.S. non-farm payrolls data, due out Friday. A strong U.S. employment number would likely give the dollar an additional boost and add to the pain in emerging markets, analysts said.\nShare this: eurozone Foreign exchange Previous WSJ City PM: Eurozone Risk Aversion Is Back, Why Bank Investors Fear Return of Doom Loop Next What to Do When There's Trouble in Europe?
