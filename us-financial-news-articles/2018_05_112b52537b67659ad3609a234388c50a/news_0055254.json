Isolated deluges of 12 inches also were possible as the storm heads inland, threatening heavy rains around the Southeast in the coming hours and days.\nDan Anderson | AP Rangers with the the National Park Service close off the Highway 399 through Gulf Islands National Seashore as a subtropical storm makes landfall on Monday, May 28, 2018 in Pensacola, Fla. Forecasters warned of life-threatening surf conditions as Alberto made landfall at Laguna Beach on the Florida Panhandle late Monday afternoon. A few brief tornadoes were possible in much of Florida and parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. But forecasters said flash flooding from heavy rain was the biggest threat for most areas.\nAs Alberto's center moves farther inland – deprived of the warm waters that fuel tropical weather systems – the storm was expected to steadily weaken. A subtropical storm like Alberto has a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds are found farther from its center.\nLifeguards posted red flags along the white sands of Pensacola Beach, where swimming and wading were banned.\nSome tourists said the rainy weather would not dampen their vacations.\nJason Powell said he was seeking to keep his children entertained until Alberto blows through his Florida Panhandle vacation spot.\n\"So far we've seen a lot of wind and the ocean is really high, covering up the entire beach,\" Powell said. \"We're not letting it ruin our vacation … we're going to watch some movies inside and a little TV, and hopefully maybe even get into the pool\" despite the rain.\nJanet Rhumes said her group of friends from Kansas had been planning their Memorial Day weekend on Navarre Beach since October, and no tropical storm could deter them.

One to four hurricanes could be \"major\" with sustained winds of at least 111 mph.\nIf that forecast holds, it would make for a near-normal or above-normal season. An average hurricane season produces 12 named storms, of which six become hurricanes, including three major hurricanes.\nMeanwhile, the storm forced some Memorial Day tributes to be canceled across Florida's Panhandle. Safety was the priority, but the decision was still a \"heartbreaker,\" said Tom Rice, a 29-year-old Army veteran who leads the organizations that planned a ceremony Monday at Beal Memorial Cemetery in Fort Walton Beach.\nSome stragglers still made their way through the rain to pay tribute at the cemetery's Veterans Tribute Tower, however. Rice said American flags had been placed Saturday on the graves of all 1,700 veterans buried in the cemetery.\n\"We got the flags out,\" Rice told the Northwest Florida Daily News as wind whipped a massive U.S. flag flying at half-staff. \"That's what's important.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/28/summer-100-deadliest-days-crashes-drunken-driving/649825002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/05/15/hawaii-volcano-kilauea-eruption-disrupts-big-island-cruises/612140002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/05/14/hawaii-travel-popular-tourism-areas-unaffected-volcano/608516002/"], "published": "2018-05-29T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:21:48.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
