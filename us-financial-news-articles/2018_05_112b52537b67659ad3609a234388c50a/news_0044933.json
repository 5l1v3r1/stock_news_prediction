Icahn may convert the shares any time between now and November 18, 2018, the filing says.\nCorvex owns 8.5 million shares, or roughly 8.7 percent of Energen. The company’s share price climbed 2.5 percent to $69.06 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.\nSince January, the company’s stock price has climbed 19.13 percent.\nIn March Energen invited energy industry entrepreneur Jonathan Cohen and investor Vincent Intrieri, a longtime associate of Icahn’s, to join the board.\nMeister worked for Icahn for seven years and served on a number of boards where the billionaire investor owned stakes. In 2010, Meister went out of on his own and founded Corvex.
