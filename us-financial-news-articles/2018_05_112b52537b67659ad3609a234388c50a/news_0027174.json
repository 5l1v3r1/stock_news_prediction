Rothschild was hired from Royal Bank of Canada.\nMizuho will formally announce the hires in a press release on Thursday.\n“Mizuho’s strategy continues to focus on expanding our client relationships in the Americas and this team will do exactly that,” Thomas Hartnett, head of Fixed Income Sales and Trading, said in an e-mail. “We anticipate doubling the size of our high yield sales & trading team over the coming year, allowing us to serve more investors while covering a larger domain of high yield sectors.”\nMizuho declined to specify the team’s existing headcount.\nThe team will complement Mizuho’s Leveraged Capital Markets group led by Richard R.S. Smith, managing director and head of Leveraged Capital Markets to the Americas, which oversees the origination of all non-investment grade debt products including high-yield bonds, institutional term loans and pro rata bank facilities.\n“This is another big boost to Mizuho’s collaborative effort to strengthen our lead left bank status in a competitive and evolving industry,” said Smith.\nMizuho made similar investments in the Investment Grade Credit sector several years ago, Hartnett said.\n“These recently announced hires will drive our High Yield Sales & Trading business expansion primarily with institutional investors and will build on the recent progress we have made in our High Yield Debt Capital Markets,” he said.\nMizuho Americas is part of Japan-based Mizuho Financial Group, Inc, which has more than 900 offices and 60,000 employees worldwide in nearly 40 countries throughout the Americas, EMEA, and Asia.
