O’Brien is INM’s largest shareholder with a stake of 29.9 percent.\nINM Chairman Murdoch MacLennan said the company had decided to oppose the appointment of ODCE inspectors because it was in the company’s and shareholders’ interests.\n“The company’s application was heard by the High Court last week, and we await the Court’s decision,” he said in a statement to be delivered at the AGM.\nHe also said the company had appointed Deloitte to conduct a full investigation and that INM would continue to co-operate fully with the ODCE and with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.\nHe said the board had notified a data security incident to the Data Protection Commissioner in August 2017, including allegations that this could have included data maintained by journalists for the purposes of their professional activities.\n“If it has occurred, this is entirely deplorable,” the chairman said in the statement.\n“The Board is particularly concerned by the suggestion that data maintained by journalists for the purposes of their professional activities might have been accessed for any improper purpose.”\nINM also gave an update on its trading performance, confirming that trading year-to-date continued to be in line with market expectations despite challenges from the weather in March and bigger declines in digital advertising.
