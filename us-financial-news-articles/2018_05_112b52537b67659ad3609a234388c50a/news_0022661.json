His attorney, Jesse Lynn, declined to comment.\nThe senators asked Icahn and Pruitt for details on the waiver, including records of discussions between both men in the months before it was granted.\nThe letters were signed by Democrats Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\nThe RFS requires refiners to add biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their gasoline and diesel, or to buy blending credits from rival companies that do - a policy intended to help farmers, cut petroleum imports, and reduce air pollution.\nEPA has the authority to exempt small refineries of less than 75,000 barrels per day of capacity if they can prove they are struggling financially with these regulations.\nThe agency has said it has granted more than two dozen such waivers in recent months, but has refused to confirm the recipients, saying the information is business sensitive. The EPA has in the past tended to grant less than ten per year, according to a former official.\nReuters has reported that Andeavor, one of America’s biggest refining companies, was among the other companies that have received hardship waivers from Trump’s EPA for its small refineries.\nAn early supporter of Trump’s 2016 presidential run and a key supporter on Wall Street, Icahn had met with Pruitt when Pruitt was being vetted in late 2016 for the EPA administrator job, and later served as a special regulatory adviser to the Republican president.\nIcahn stepped down from his advisory role last August after lawmakers cited potential ethical problems.\nCurrently, Icahn is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for his role in influencing biofuels policy while serving as Trump’s adviser. Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that Icahn may have used his presidential access to benefit his investments, a charge Icahn has rejected.
