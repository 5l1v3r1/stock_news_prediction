Samsung Securities said its staff collectively sold shares worth $186.9 million, but added that the individuals weren’t able to cash in because the trades were canceled before the settlement date.\nAn initial investigation by financial regulators last month found that some staff had taken action despite the company’s alerts on the accidental shares. The Financial Supervisory Service’s pending decision over what to do with Samsung Securities in response to the error is one of the most pressing issues facing the watchdog’s newly appointed chief regulator, Yoon Seok-hun, who will take office Tuesday.\nSamsung hasn’t decided on the number of employees it will seek legal action against, said a company spokeswoman. The company previously identified 16 people who sold the problematic shares and another six who had attempted to do so.\nThe brokerage’s shares have fallen 8.4% since the April incident. Monday’s announcement had no impact on shares, as the market was closed for a public holiday.\nSamsung Securities said its 27 executives, including Chief Executive Koo Sung-Hoon, would purchase some of the firm’s treasury shares starting this month, in a show of support for the company and to boost share value.\n“We will take this accident as a stepping stone to bring noticeable change and innovation to Samsung Securities,” Mr. Koo said in a press release.\nThe Samsung conglomerate faces other issues. Samsung BioLogics Co. , its contract-drug-manufacturing arm, had $6 billion in market capitalization wiped out last week after it was accused by the country’s financial watchdog for alleged accounting irregularities.\nSamsung Biologics denied it violated accounting rules. Financial regulators haven’t made a final decision on the probe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:39:55.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
