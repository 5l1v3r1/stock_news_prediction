Such forward-looking statements necessarily involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Aveda’s actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially from any projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk that the Arrangement is delayed or is not completed for any reason, the risk that the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement are not realized, the risk that the Earnout does not become payable for any reason, including the actual results of Aveda’s future operations, factors beyond Aveda’s control, and the risks identified in the Information Circular and Aveda’s management discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the \"MD&A\"), both of which are available for viewing on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .
