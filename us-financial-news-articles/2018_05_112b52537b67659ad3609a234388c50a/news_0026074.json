A look at Meghan Markle’s Toronto haunts Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nTORONTO (Reuters) - The future bride of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, may have been born and raised in California, but for much of the past seven years the actress has called Toronto home.\nThe city where she first met Harry was the backdrop for her TV series “Suits” and the subject of many of her now-deleted social media posts.\nThe Annex neighbourhood where she lived was first alerted to the budding romance when Canadian police “started hanging out in their SUVs and they would just stay there, parked revving their vehicles all day and all night,” recalled one neighbour, Russell Leon.\nIn some of her official outings with Harry, Markle has worn outfits from Canadian casual fashion retailer Aritzia, leading to a “Markle effect” in sales for the store.\n“We’re definitely seeing a direct correlation of interest from items that she is seen wearing, down to the exact colour,” said the company’s product director, Verna Ursua Brown.\nWhen Markle wanted a gourmet treat, she often visited fine foods shop, Cheese Boutique. Co-owner Afrim Pristine said he and Markle became friendly over the years, and he introduced the actress to a French butter, which she raved about on social media.

She’s so nice and she’s so lovely and ultimately that’s what Torontonians stand for,” said Mila Gaurilova.
