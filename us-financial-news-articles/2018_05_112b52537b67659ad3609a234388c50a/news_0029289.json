He has not yet been appointed a lawyer.\nCambodia’s lese-majeste law stipulates that a prosecutor can file a criminal suit on behalf of the monarchy against anyone deemed to be insulting the royal family.\nThose found guilty would face between one and five years in prison and a fine of between $500 and $2,500.\nKing Norodom Sihamoni is officially Cambodia’s head of state, but long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen has ruled for 33 years.\nLast year, the opposition CNRP was dissolved at the government’s request and its leader, Kem Sokha, arrested on treason charges that he says were politically driven.\nThe crackdown comes ahead of a July 29 general election in which Hun Sen will be largely unchallenged.\nIn neighbouring Thailand, lese-majeste cases have increased since the military took control following a 2014 coup.\nThe junta has vowed to use harsh measures against perceived critics of the country’s royal family.\nThailand has some of the world’s toughest lese-majeste laws. Those found guilty face up to 15 years in prison for each offence.
