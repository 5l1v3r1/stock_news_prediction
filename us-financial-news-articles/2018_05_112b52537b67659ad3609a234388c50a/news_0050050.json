Bouygues , which runs Bouygues Telecom, climbed 2.6 percent.\nSeveral attempts to cut the number of French telecoms operators from four two free have failed over the last few years. The last try was in 2016, when Orange failed to acquire Bouygues Telecom. [\nArcep published a report earlier on Tuesday that showed that in 2017, French telecom operators had invested an extra 660 million euros ($779.53 million) more than the previous year, for an overall total of 9.6 billion euros.\n$1 = 0.8467 euros Reporting by Blandine Henault and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Mathieu Rosemain\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:03:48.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
