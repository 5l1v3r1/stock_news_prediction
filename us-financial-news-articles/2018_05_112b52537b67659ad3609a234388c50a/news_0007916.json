Sales of Detroit Three brands such as Chevrolet, Ford and Chrysler were down while sales of Asian and European premium-brand vehicles increased.\nJackson said AutoNation will act to reduce the inventory of vehicles it carries in response to rising interest costs for stocking cars and trucks.\nJackson said he expects the shift by U.S. consumers toward trucks and sport utility vehicles that offer drivers and passengers a high seating position will continue, despite a recent increase in gasoline prices to more than $3 a gallon in some markets.\n“It would take $5 or 6 a gallon to reverse consumer behavior,” Jackson said.\nFort Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation reported first-quarter net income of 93 million or $1.01 per share, down from $98 million or 97 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.01.\nThe company reported revenue of $5.26 billion, up from $5.14 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $5.27 billion.\nIn morning trading, AutoNation shares were down $1.50 at $44.69.\nEditing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:54:06.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
