Kinder Morgan Canada will continue to own the remaining assets, including crude storage, rail terminals and a condensate pipeline, and look to expand, he said.\nCanada's oil sector has been stung in the past year as foreign energy companies retreated amid concerns about the environmental toll, high production costs and a risky regulatory regime.\nMorneau said more investment will be needed to complete the construction of the pipeline expansion, and that in the long term the project \"has commercial value\" and should be in the private sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T20:08:17.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
