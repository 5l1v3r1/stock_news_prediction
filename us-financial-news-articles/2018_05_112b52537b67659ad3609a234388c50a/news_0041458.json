The hotel marks the seventh of 11 hotels being marketed for sale previously disclosed in October 2017. Red Lion Hotel Templin’s on the River, along with all other sold hotels, has signed a franchise license agreement to retain their Red Lion brand.\nRLH Corporation’s total loss on the sale is expected to be approximately $0.3 million, and $6.7 million of the proceeds of the sale was used for debt repayment at the closing. Together with the other six previously announced sales, RLH Corporation’s gain on sales is approximately $16.2 million.\n“We have made great strides in becoming an asset light company,” said RLH Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer Greg Mount. “With seven hotels sold so far in 2018, we have been able to repay the long-term debt relating to those assets and increase cash reserves and debt capacity to fund growth of our franchise business.”\nRed Lion Hotel Templin’s on the River accounted for $4.3 million in revenue on an annual basis in 2017. The hotel’s adjusted EBITDA on consolidated reporting was $1.0 million and RLH Corporation’s share of the adjusted EBITDA was approximately $0.5 million for 2017. This impact does not take into account the previously announced corporate overhead adjustments to reduce operating costs.\nTo learn more about franchising with RLH Corporation, visit franchise.rlhco.com .
