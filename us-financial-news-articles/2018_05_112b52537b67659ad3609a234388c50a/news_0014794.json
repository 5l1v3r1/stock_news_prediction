Logo of Airbus is pictured at the Airbus A380 final assembly line at Airbus headquarters in Blagnac, near Toulouse, France, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\nIranAir has ordered 200 passenger aircraft worth $38.3 billion at list prices, including 100 from Airbus ( AIR.PA ), 80 from Boeing ( BA.N ) and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR ( LDOF.MI ). All the deals are dependent on U.S. licences because of the heavy use of U.S. parts in commercial planes.\n“We’re carefully analysing the announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with sanctions and export control regulations,” Airbus communications chief Rainer Ohler said.\n“This will take some time,”he added.
