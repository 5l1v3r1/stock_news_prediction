It put support at 21 percent for the main opposition CHP, 12 percent for the newly founded Iyi (Good) Party and 10 percent for the pro-Kurdish HDP.\nLike the AKP and MHP, the opposition CHP and Iyi Party are also members of an alliance, easing pressure on the smaller parties to exceed the 10 percent threshold.\nThe survey was conducted between April 13 - 20. President Erdogan announced the snap elections on April 18.\nEarlier this week, Erdogan said the AK Party needed a parliamentary majority to make constitutional changes until the new executive presidential system becomes fully functional.\n“Aside from presidential decrees, there will be a need to make several legal changes, implement new regulations or even constitutional changes until the new system is fully functional,” Erdogan told lawmakers in parliament.
