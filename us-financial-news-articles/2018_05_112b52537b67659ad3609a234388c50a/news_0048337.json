It’s great that they have him in custody.\n“But probably the most, the happiest I will be when the story will end, when everything will be done and finished.\n“I can’t really say anything more, but so far I’m very happy with this, and I’m just here to play tennis and we will see what happens after.”\nKvitova, who won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014, said it had been “a little bit of a wait” for a suspect to be detained for the knife attack at her home.\n“It’s the police and they do what they have to do. And in the end, hopefully they did a great job,” she said.\n“Probably the timing isn’t the best, but it’s great news, right? So I should be happy. I am happy.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:53:52.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
