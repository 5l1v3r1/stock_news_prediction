It was a weird weekend.\nFirst, last week, Mr. Musk attacked the idea of moats - -or strong brands that give competitors a high barrier to entry—in Tesla ’s quarterly earnings call. “I think moats are lame,” the Tesla CEO said.\nThe Berkshire Hathway Inc. chairman and CEO is particularly fond of moats. So, he shot back at Mr. Musk at Berkshire’s annual meeting this weekend in Omaha.\n“Certainly you should be working at improving your own moat, defending your own moat, all of the time,” Mr. Buffett, the owner of See’s Candies, said. “And Elon may turn things upside down in some areas. I don’t think he’d want to take us on in candy.”\nHow did Mr. Musk respond? He Tweeted that he was going to start a candy company . He also Tweeted that he was going to build a moat and fill it with candy, and that this candy moat would be kryptonite for Berkshire.\nAppearing on CNBC Monday morning, Mr. Buffett urged Mr. Musk to reconsider.\nHe said that consumers are brand loyal to candy bars. If you go into a drugstore and say, “I would like a Snickers,” and the owner offers to sell you a different candy bar for 10 cents less, you’ll go across the street and get a Snickers. He notes the top selling candy bars in America haven’t really changed for 50 years.\n“I can’t take them on. I don’t think Elon can take them on. They have moats,” Mr. Buffett said.\nAs for if there was a broader backstory between the two, Mr. Buffett said he doesn’t have a relationship with the Tesla founder. Mr. Buffett wished him luck trying something new, adding it will be the American public that decides if Mr. Musk is a success.\nBut Mr. Buffett also couldn’t help bringing up the latest Tesla headlines, saying he heard Mr. Musk has to raise some money. Early Monday, in a Tesla filing, the company reiterated it may need to raise additional capital to fund growth of its business, though didn’t specify a time period.\nShare this: Berkshire annual meeting Elon Musk See’s Candy Tesla Previous The Capital Spending Boom is Mostly About Tech Next Weight Gain Season for Felines", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T16:24:15.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
