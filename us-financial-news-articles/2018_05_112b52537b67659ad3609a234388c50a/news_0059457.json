Santander and BBVA rose rose 0.6 to 1.1 percent.\nEuro zone financials overall fell 0.1 percent however, in their sixth straight day of losses as investors remained wary of bank stocks which would be worst hit by any systemic risks to the euro zone.\nWhile the focus remained firmly on politics, Vivendi was the biggest faller, down nearly 4 percent after its subsidiary Canal+ was left empty-handed in a crucial soccer broadcasting rights auction in France on Tuesday.\nBayer meanwhile drove gains on Germany’s DAX, rising 3.9 percent after winning U.S. approval for its takeover of Monsanto, set to create by far the largest seeds and pesticides maker in the world.\nA recovery in crude prices helped buoy the oil sector up to lead Europe with a 2 percent gain, supporting the STOXX. Oil majors BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total were the top boosts, up 1.7 to 2.6 percent.
