Yet Salvini shows no sign of backing down, creating a headache for Conte and potentially undermining the delicate equilibrium of the coalition before it even gets going.\nFormer prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, an ally of Salvini before the election, said on Thursday his Forza Italia party would vote against the new government in parliament, calling its programme “a naive book of dreams”.\nForza Italia’s votes are not necessary for the 5-Star/League coalition to obtain a majority.\nThe nascent government has the backing of most Italians, with an opinion poll by the Demopolis agency on Wednesday showing 61 percent were in favour and 39 percent against.\nSavona’s appointment would probably alarm EU heavyweight Germany, in particular. He warns in his latest book that the Germans are now trying to dominate Europe economically, having failed to achieve the goal militarily in World War II.\n“Savona’s positions are radically and suicidally anti-German,” former Italian economy minister Vincenzo Visco said in an interview in the daily Corriere della Sera on Thursday.\nItalian markets, which sold off this week on the prospect of an inexperienced, eurosceptic government taking over the euro zone’s third largest economy, recovered on Thursday morning. Italy’s main share index was up 0.4 percent and the gap between the yield on Italian benchmark bonds and their safer German equivalent narrowed to 184 basis points from 190 on Wednesday.
