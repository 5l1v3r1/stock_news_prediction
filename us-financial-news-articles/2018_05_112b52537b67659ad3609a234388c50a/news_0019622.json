Portugal has since returned to economic growth and cut its budget deficit to below the -European Union threshold.\n“As we approach a level of 12 percent of CET1 (solvency ratio) with a low single digit growth in terms of risk weighted assets, we are generating organic capital and what makes sense is to distribute this capital to shareholders,” Miguel Braganca said on a call with analysts.\nShares in the bank closed 4.9 percent higher on Tuesday boosted by the strong results, including the CET1 ratio of 11.8 percent, which is up from 11.1 percent a year ago.\n“By the end of this year we should be in a position to start to distribute (a) dividend,” he said, adding that the decision also depends on other opportunities and what solvency ratio levels can be considered as adequate.\n“I think a bank such (as) ours should have a ratio of CET1 between 11 pct and 12 pct and the remaining capital should be distributed to shareholders,” Braganca said.
