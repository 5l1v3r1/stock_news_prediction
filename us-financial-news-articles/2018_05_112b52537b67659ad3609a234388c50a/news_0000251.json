Buffett's comments drove Apple ahead of the rest of the tech sector and overall market.\nThe Dow dropped 100 points after the open; tech giants Amazon , Alphabet , Netflix and Facebook all started trading in the red — but Apple was nearly 4 percent up at its peak.\n\"I don't think he's done. I think the numbers of the investment in Apple are going to go higher and maybe even significantly higher,\" said David Rolfe, CIO of Wedgewood Partners, which counts Berkshire and Apple as its two largest holdings.\nApple currently accounts for about a quarter of Berkshire's portfolio, Rolfe told CNBC's \" Squawk on the Street ,\" but he wouldn't be surprised to see that increase to a third or even half of the portfolio.\nApple CEO Tim Cook said the company is \"thrilled\" to have Buffett and Berkshire as a major investor.\n\"On a personal level, I've always greatly admired Warren and have always been grateful for his insight and advice,\" Cook said in a statement.\nBuffett told CNBC he'd been buying a lot of stock in the first quarter, but not across the board. He revealed Berkshire had sold completely out of IBM and said he is not looking to buy General Electric .\nHe also spoke to broader economic growth and commented on a rare activist move to block the board nominations at building materials company USG .\nshow chapters I think Buffett is going to scoop up a number of shares of Apple over the next few years: David Rolfe 5 Hours Ago | 04:14", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:57:51.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
