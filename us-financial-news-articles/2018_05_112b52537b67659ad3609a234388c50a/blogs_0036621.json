( bit.ly/2wIV3W5 )\nDeteriorating sentiment and lower transaction volumes have driven these falls with average prices expected to fall further in 2018, it said.\nState-linked Aldar agreed this month with Abu Dhabi’s Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC) to acquire real estate assets worth 3.7 billion dirhams. The cash transaction is expected to close in the second quarter 2018, Fewer said.\nAldar has a capital expenditure programme of 5.4 billion dirhams for the next two years and could increase this, it said earlier this year. The company is also on track to “successfully” refinance its dollar sukuk due in December, Fewer said. In March, Aldar won approval from shareholders to increase foreign ownership in the company to 49 percent from 40 percent. Currently, foreign ownership in Aldar is about 26-27 percent, Fewer said.
