Former Royal Army officer Richard Lee, senior investigating warrant military police officer Richard O'Leary and lower house of parliament member Mike Hill (R) walk at the site where British military police search for remains of Lee's two-year-old girl Katrice who went missing 36 years ago in Germany where her father was stationed with the British army at the time, near the river of Alme in Paderborn, Germany, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\nKatrice Lee disappeared from a shop for British troops near the German town of Paderborn in 1981, where her father was based while serving in the British army. The case has never been solved. Her family believes she was abducted.\nThe military police’s senior investigating officer Richard O’Leary said excavations of the bank of the River Alme started on Monday and would take up to five weeks. The aim was to find evidence, possibly some clothing or even Katrice herself.\n“As her father, I want them to find nothing, then it leaves the theory that she was abducted,” Richard Lee, 68, told reporters at the site in a clear and composed voice.

Investigators have released a photo of what investigators think Katrice would look like now at the age of 38, and a photo-fit of a possible suspect.\nThe new search was prompted by a fresh analysis of witness and forensic evidence. O’Leary said he was particularly interested in a green car seen near the excavation site the day after Katrice’s disappearance. On the day she went missing, a witness had seen a man with a child in a green car.\nThe family is critical of mistakes made in the original investigation.\n“I blame the original investigation and I will never forgive them for what they did not do,” said Lee.
