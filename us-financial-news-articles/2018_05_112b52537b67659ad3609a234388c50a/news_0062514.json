Both entities will continue to operate under their respective brands.\n“Infront’s position in terms of customer enablement aligns with our own, and the company’s culture of automation and DevOps means the capacity to better execute throughout the entire IT landscape,” said Green House Data CEO Shawn Mills. “We’ve always taken a consultative approach with our clients, and this relationship with Infront helps us to further codify our position, as well as create more value to our enterprise customers.”\nWhether wanting to move away from legacy applications and infrastructure, go all-in with cloud, manage Azure workloads, or employ a hybrid model, this partnership forms a central vendor to help organizations simplify compute resources, receive efficiently delivered consulting services, and optimize end-to-end application delivery. In an era of rapid change, Green House Data and Infront will help their shared clients compete by extending IT teams, supporting DevOps culture, and being available 7/24/365 with a 15-Minute Hear from a Human response time SLA.\n“More and more enterprises we’ve worked with have requested ongoing IT management as their consulting engagement concludes,” said Rory McCaw, CEO of Infront Consulting Group. “We saw a natural fit with Green House Data’s managed services expertise and an opportunity to organically expand into a more comprehensive platform.”\nIn March of this year, Green House Data announced the addition of Azure management to complement the company’s existing private managed clouds, traditional colocation, and managed services. Beginning with the SpotLITE discovery process, which examines business drivers and client staff expertise in order to architect the ideal infrastructure to meet budgets and hit productivity, reliability, and performance goals, the company designs and migrates clients in the mid-market and enterprise spaces to custom hybrid infrastructure.\nInfront Consulting Group is a Gold Managed Microsoft Partner, multi-year winner of Microsoft’s Partner of the Year Award, and both a Profit 500 and INC 5000 growth company. Founded in 2001, the company has close to two decades of Microsoft competency, and an international team of experts who are able to drive automation and solution delivery to enable IT modernization. The company has helped architect and deploy IT solutions that support business growth and efficiency across the globe.\n“Throughout our history, as we’ve looked to partner, acquire, or merge, we’ve been guided by the needs and requirements of our customer base,” said Mills. “Bringing Infront into the Green House Data family will only further our ability to help lead the IT transformation that allows our clients to capture market share and ultimately be successful. It’s an exciting time, and there’s only more to come.”\nABOUT GREEN HOUSE DATA\nGreen House Data is a managed services provider that helps organizations choose the IT platforms that will best enable their business, delivered from highly energy efficient, green data centers located across the country and paired with an industry-leading 15 Minute Hear from a Human℠ customer support SLA.
