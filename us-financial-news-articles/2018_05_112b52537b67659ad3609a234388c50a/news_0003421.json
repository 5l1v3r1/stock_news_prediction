Above, immigration agents serve an employment audit notice at a 7-Eleven convenience store in Los Angeles in January. Associated Press Good morning. Many U.S. employers began last year full of hope a more business-friendly Trump administration would roll back Obama-era workplace rules. Some of those changes came to pass but the shift in direction came at a price, as 64% of respondents to a survey said the changes in workplace policies and regulations created a burden for their businesses.\nAnd policy moves by state and local governments in response to federal actions have complicated matters still more, according to the survey of 1,111 in-house lawyers, human-resources people and C-suite executives by law firm Littler Mendelson PC. Three-quarters of respondents said these employment-related state and local requirements led to compliance challenges.\nPolicies related to health-care law, overtime, unionization and the collection of data on pay were dropped or put on hold while the Trump administration tightened regulation on immigration, Littler said. “Employers have justifiably felt buffeted by abrupt and sweeping regulatory changes as policies are built and, often while workplaces are still adapting to them, dismantled,” the firm said.\nEmployers expect less drama in the coming 12 months, the survey found. Fifteen percent expect a major impact from the Affordable Care Act in 2018, compared with 33% in 2017. The share of respondents concerned about enforcement by the Department of Labor slid to 16% from 25%, while worry over action by the National Labor Relations Board fell to 8% from 13%.\n“Companies want certainty more than anything,” said Michael Lotito, co-chairman of Littler’s Workplace Policy Institute. “Uncertainty means inability to plan, budget and anticipate, and it requires constantly retraining employees and reformulating employment policies.”\nCOMPLIANCE\nVW ex-chief is indicted over emissions.
