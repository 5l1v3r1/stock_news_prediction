The automaker has suspended production of full-size vans.\nMeanwhile, Fiat Chrysler says some production of the Chrysler Pacifica Minivan has also been impacted.\nThe automakers are hamstrung by the fact that particular parts for certain models are made exclusively by Meridian Lightweight Technologies. Since a sizable portion of Meridian's manufacturing plant has been knocked out due to fire damage, production for some vehicle models has been impacted.\nshow chapters Battery production is Tesla's bottleneck: Analyst 7:31 PM ET Wed, 18 April 2018 | 02:52 Ford has completely halted production of the F-150 and the Super Duty F-Series pickup truck. It's working with Meridian, while also talking with other suppliers to get critical components flowing again. Until that happens, production stops or slows down.\n\"For the automakers, this is serious,\" said one auto industry executive. \"The parts shortage will likely be resolved in a couple weeks. Until then, it's touch and go.\"\nCompared to the tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 and knocked out several auto parts suppliers, the Meridian fire's impact on final assembly lines is not as great. Still, it's a reminder how one supplier building specific parts for a number of automakers can cripple product lines if its plant is severely damaged. Adding to the problem is the fact that there are not many suppliers who make molded components with magnesium casting.\n\"Magnesium casting is not a huge business, so there's not a lot of capacity that can quickly step in and start producing parts,\" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research.\nWATCH: Ford backs forecast despite F-150 production halt\nshow chapters Ford reaffirms full-year earnings guidance despite halting production of F-150 models 23 Hours Ago | 02:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:37:44.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
