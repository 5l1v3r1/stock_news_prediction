We are also very pleased to have delivered a second successive quarter of increasing bookings along with a strong book to bill ratio on solid new orders coming from our growth platforms. Revenue was down reflecting the reduced activity and backlog from soft end markets in 2017.

A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is a numerical measure of a company's historical financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the GAAP statement of operations.\nNon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share and adjusted EBITDA, as we present them in the financial data included in this press release, have been adjusted to exclude the effects of transactions related to gain on divestitures, net of selling costs, legacy design repairs, property, plant and equipment valuation adjustments, acquisition and integration expense activities including retention, legal, accounting, banking, amortization and contingent earn-out expenses, foreign currency re-measurement, executive transition expenses, facility exit expenses, restructuring expense, other nonrecurring or infrequent items and the associated tax benefit of these items. Management believes that these items are not necessarily indicative of the Company's ongoing operations and their exclusion provides individuals with additional information to compare the Company's results over multiple periods. Management utilizes this information to evaluate its ongoing financial performance. Our financial statements may continue to be affected by items similar to those excluded in the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that all such costs are unusual or infrequent.\nNon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share and adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of CECO's results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, CECO cautions investors that non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nIn accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share and adjusted EBITDA stated in the tables above present the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nSAFE HARBOR\nAny statements contained in this Press Release, other than statements of historical fact, including statements about management's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. These statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance. We use words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intends,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"will,\" \"plan,\" \"should\" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Potential risks, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed under \"Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring program; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and realize the synergies from acquisitions, as well as a number of factors related to our business, including economic and financial market conditions generally and economic conditions in CECO's service areas; dependence on fixed price contracts and the risks associated therewith, including actual costs exceeding estimates; fluctuations in operating results from period to period due to cyclicality or seasonality of the business; the effect of growth on CECO's infrastructure, resources, and existing sales; the ability to expand operations in both new and existing markets; the potential for contract delay or cancellation; liabilities arising from faulty services or products that could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty, or other claims; changes in or developments with respect to any litigation or investigation; failure to meet timely completion or performance standards that could result in higher cost and reduced profits or, in some cases, losses on projects; the potential for fluctuations in prices for manufactured components and raw materials; the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with our acquisitions and our ability to repay or refinance it or incur additional debt in the future; the impact of federal, state or local government regulations; economic and political conditions generally; and the effect of competition in the Industrial Solutions segment, Energy Solutions segment and Fluid Handling Solutions segment industries. Many of these risks are beyond management's ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements as they speak only to our views as of the date the statement is made. Furthermore, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of the SEC, we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ceco-environmental-corp-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300645967.html\nSOURCE CECO Environmental Corp.", "external_links": ["https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2129441-1&h=3118609803&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.cecoenviro.com%2Fevents-webcasts-and-presentations&a=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.cecoenviro.com%2Fevents-webcasts-and-presentations", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ceco-environmental-corp-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300645967.html", "https://investors.cecoenviro.com/events-webcasts-and-presentations", "https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2129441-1&h=2420131591&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2115548-1%26h%3D408426633%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.cecoenviro.com%252F%26a%3Dwww.cecoenviro.com&a=www.cecoenviro.com"], "published": "2018-05-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:48:10.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
