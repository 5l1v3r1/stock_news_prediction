(\" Camrova \" or the \" Company \") (TSX-V:CAV) (OTC:BAJFF) is pleased to provide an update on the status of the Company's due diligence investigations regarding its previously announced proposed arm's length acquisition of certain mining properties and related processing assets located in Chile (please see Camrova's press release dated April 3, 2018).\nIncluded as part of the assets that Camrova intends to acquire are (i) a contract with Anglo American Sur S.A. (\" Anglo \") to remove and process slag produced by a copper flash smelter; (ii) existing plant facilities for production of pregnant liquor solution (PS) located approximately 16 km from the smelter; and (iii) certain mining concessions located nearby covering about 800 hectares (collectively, the \" Target Assets \").\nAnglo operates a copper flash smelter in proximity to the Target Assets, which processes concentrates at a rate of 40,000 tonnes per month. Anglo's life of mine forecasts indicate an expected concentrate supply for this smelter in excess of fifty years from local mine operations. The smelter produces approximately 30,000 t/m of slag that is added to a pile now containing over 5 million tonnes of slag.\nThe existing processing facilities forming part of the Target Assets are used to vat and heap leach material containing approximately 1% copper derived from the concessions. Material is presently mined at a rate of 1,000 t/m.\nThe acquisition of the Target Assets would enable Camrova to remove slag from the Anglo smelter and deliver it to Target site for processing in a new flotation plant to be constructed at this site. Additional to the slag facilities, Camrova will continue to have the ability to process material mined from its own concessions and/or purchased from third parties.\nThe vendors of the Target Assets are residents of Chile and are expected to join the Camrova management team on closing. One of the vendors owns a local trucking company which could be helpful with providing logistics to the project.\nTo advance its due diligence review in respect of the proposed acquisition of the Target Assets, Camrova is pleased to announce it has retained WS Ingenieria Ltda. of Santiago, Chile to prepare a technical report in connection with the Target Assets pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects . Management expects the technical report to be delivered within approximately three months.\nTo fund the Company's continuing due diligence investigations, Camrova announced a proposed non-brokered private placement financing on April 3, 2018, which included a financing component pursuant to the Existing Shareholder Exemption. For further information on the subscription process and to obtain a subscription agreement, please visit www.camrovaresources.com/shareholder-financing.php .\nReaders are cautioned that as Camrova's due diligence review of the Target Assets has not yet been completed, the statements contained herein are subject to change in whole or in part. Camrova has relied on third party historical data in reaching some of its conclusions, which data may be inaccurate or incomplete. There is as yet no binding agreement between Camrova and the vendors of the Target Assets and there are no assurances that such an agreement can be reached on commercially viable terms, or at all.\nKen Baxter MSc, BSc is the qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, for Camrova and supervised the preparation of, and has reviewed and approved, the technical information in this release.\nAbout Camrova Resources Inc.\nCamrova is a Canadian mining company.
