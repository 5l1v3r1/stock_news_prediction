(NASDAQ: MEET), a public market leader in the mobile meeting space, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $37.6 million, up 88% year over year Mobile revenue of $30.7 million, up 63% year over year GAAP net loss of $4.2 million, or a net loss of $0.06 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 million, up 9% year over year Non-GAAP net income of $4.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to $4.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the prior year quarter\n(See the important discussion about the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliation to the most direct comparable GAAP financial measure, below.)\n“We are off to a strong start to the year, with growth from live video monetization accelerating at an even faster pace than we had anticipated,” said Geoff Cook, Chief Executive Officer of The Meet Group. “Video revenue grew approximately 120% from December 2017 to March 2018, which we attribute to momentum on our MeetMe app, the launch of livestreaming monetization on Skout, and our focus on strengthening our livestreaming community and the quality of our livestreams. Our annualized video revenue run rate now exceeds $29 million based on April’s results, up 53% from February’s run rate.\n“Key video metrics are improving, and we are setting new highs on a regular basis,” continued Cook. “We have been particularly pleased to see average revenue per paying video user grow to $76 for the month of March on MeetMe Live. Average revenue per daily active user for MeetMe Live, or vARPDAU, in the United States increased to 44 cents in March and is now nearing levels achieved by leading livestreaming companies in Asia. Total vARPDAU, which includes Skout and MeetMe, was 18 cents in March. Importantly, the percentage of MeetMe users engaged in video exceeded 25% for the first time in April.\n“We are continuing to video-enable more of our large, global community and build our social entertainment platform. Having recently rolled-out our shared livestreaming platform on Tagged, we are pleased to announce that we have launched enhanced video monetization on that app, ahead of schedule. We expect to begin launching live video on Lovoo later this month, starting with Austria. We expect our rollout of live video to more of our users, combined with our deep product pipeline, to contribute to continued growth in video revenue.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, The Meet Group reported revenue of $37.6 million, an increase of 88% from $20.1 million in the prior year quarter. GAAP net loss was $4.2 million, or a net loss of $0.06 per share, compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 was $5.2 million compared to $4.8 million in the prior year quarter.\nThe Company ended the quarter with $28.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash flow from operating activities was $7.4 million.\nCompany Outlook\nThe Company is providing the following outlook for the second quarter of 2018 and is increasing its outlook for the full year 2018.\nSecond quarter 2018:\nRevenue in the range of $38.0 million to $39.0 million Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $5.3 million to $5.6 million\nFull year 2018:\nRevenue in the range of $152.0 million to $155.0 million Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $21.5 million to $23.5 million\nTHE MEET GROUP, INC.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained herein are . The words “believe,” “may,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “should,” “plan,” “could,” “target,” “potential,” “project,” “is likely,” “expect” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify . We have based these largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the include the risk that our applications will not function easily or otherwise as anticipated, the risk that we will not launch additional features and upgrades as anticipated, the risk that unanticipated events affect the functionality of our applications with popular mobile operating systems, any changes in such operating systems that degrade our mobile applications’ functionality and other unexpected issues which could adversely affect usage on mobile devices. Further information on our risk factors is contained in our filings with the Commission (“SEC”), including the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2018.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes them to be an important supplemental measure of performance that is commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We refer you to the reconciliations below.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (or loss) from operations before interest expense, benefit or provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, warrant obligations, non-recurring acquisition, restructuring or other expenses, gain or loss on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, gain on sale of asset, bad debt expense outside the normal range, and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. The Company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature. The Company defines Non-GAAP Net Income as earnings (or loss) before benefit or provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, non-recurring acquisition and restructuring costs, bad debt expense outside the normal range and non-cash stock based compensation.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or any other financial measure. They may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor is it intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006383/en/\nThe Meet Group, Inc.\nInvestor Contact:\nLeslie Arena, 267-714-6418\nlarena@themeetgroup.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nBrandyn Bissinger, 267-446-7010\nbbissinger@themeetgroup.com\nSource: The Meet Group, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006383/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.themeetgroup.com&esheet=51799904&newsitemid=20180502006383&lan=en-US&anchor=www.themeetgroup.com&index=1&md5=5c755afe0d53ae4c10585b4b5db0b42f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthemeetgroup%2F&esheet=51799904&newsitemid=20180502006383&lan=en-US&anchor=Facebook&index=3&md5=fbb1215052f2436c0bd463af107e0401", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.themeetgroup.com&esheet=51799904&newsitemid=20180502006383&lan=en-US&anchor=themeetgroup.com&index=2&md5=e3bf02e74b94be15e332857613c0189a", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2F1404480%2F&esheet=51799904&newsitemid=20180502006383&lan=en-US&anchor=LinkedIn&index=5&md5=d72527ce09b4baa2b5612f542edde3c3", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FtheMEETteam&esheet=51799904&newsitemid=20180502006383&lan=en-US&anchor=Twitter&index=4&md5=5d76b697db6e923369ddc7ddb05b4966"], "published": "2018-05-03T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T01:57:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
