Parkside Plaza is a 100,340 square foot, 5-story Class A office building located in Turkey Creek, a mixed-use retail, office and entertainment complex in the Town of Farragut in west Knoxville. Constructed in 2007, the building features a three-story entry atrium and is benefitted by convenient access and visibility from I-40/75 and ample surface parking.\n“Parkside Plaza is strategically located within the Knoxville market, providing Viking with the opportunity to build upon the strong base of tenants currently occupying Parkside,” said Bret Caller, Principal with Viking Partners. “The fourth floor offers 20,000 square feet of contiguous space for one tenant or may be subdivided for smaller users. Given the potential upside in the asset, Parkside will be a great add to our existing portfolio.”\nLeasing for the building is being handled by Deborah Petrolina with IMS and Matt Fentress with NAI Koella | RM Moore, both based in Knoxville.\nFor information on the entire Viking portfolio, visit www.vikingpartnersllc.com .
