The cancellations also coincide with a downturn in Turkish equity prices after shares reached a record high in January.\nThe flotation values the grocer at 6.43 billion lira with 35.71 percent traded on the Istanbul stock exchange following the completion of the Yildiz Holding allocated capital increase at the same price.\nSok’s book was oversubscribed and 85 percent of the shares was sold to foreign investors including the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), while the remainder was bought by domestic investors.\nSok shares will start trading on May 18.
