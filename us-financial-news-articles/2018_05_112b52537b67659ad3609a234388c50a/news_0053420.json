The deal includes an $8 million option for 2020.\nCastillo has hit .260 with 86 home runs and 298 RBIs across his nine-year major league career played between the Chicago Cubs (2010-15), Seattle Mariners (2015), Arizona Diamondbacks (2015-16), Baltimore Orioles (2017) and White Sox.\nThe only other catcher on the White Sox’s active roster is Omar Narvaez.
