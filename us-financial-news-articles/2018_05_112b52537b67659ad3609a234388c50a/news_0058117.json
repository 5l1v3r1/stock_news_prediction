Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS The election prompted a further deterioration in relations between the two countries. The United States responded to the vote, which it called undemocratic, with additional sanctions, prompting Venezuela to expel the top two U.S. diplomats posted in Caracas. The United States responded with a similar move.\n“It was a very good meeting, it is good news for the Venezuelan people,” Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez told reporters, without providing details of what the officials discussed.\nState television images showed Maduro and Corker, a Tennessee Republican and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, shaking hands in the Miraflores presidential palace, though neither offered statements to the media.\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro meets with U.S. Senator Bob Corker at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, Venezuela May 25, 2018.

U.S. officials say Venezuela is using Holt as a bargaining chip in sanctions talks\nVenezuela’s economy is experiencing a fifth year of contraction, with hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicines prompting mass emigration. The United States has sanctioned individuals linked to Maduro in recent months, accusing them of corruption.\nMaduro frequently accuses Washington of conspiring to overthrow his government and seize control of the OPEC member’s oil reserves, the largest in the world, and has said the United States’ “economic war” is to blame for the country’s woes.\nReporting by Deisy Buitrago, writing by Luc Cohen, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T03:32:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
