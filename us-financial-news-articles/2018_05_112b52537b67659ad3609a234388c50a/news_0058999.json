(\" PHX Energy \" or the \" Corporation \") (TSX:PHX) announces that its Board of Directors (the “ Board ”) has approved an increase to the Corporation’s 2018 capital expenditure program (the “ program ”) by $8 million to $18.5 million. The increase to the 2018 program is expected to be principally directed to the expansion of PHX Energy’s fleet of performance drilling motors, including its proprietary high performance 7.25\" Atlas motor (“ Atlas ”), to support increasing activity in the Permian basin region of the Corporation’s US operations.\nThe majority of the additional performance drilling motors being purchased will be dedicated to a new performance drilling motor rental business, branded Atlas Power. This division was recently engaged by a prominent operator in the Permian basin to provide an exclusive performance drilling motor rental fleet, which includes the Atlas high performance motor. Atlas’ powerful performance and the resulting operating advantages were a key factor in PHX Energy securing this opportunity, as was the Corporation’s extensive performance drilling motor expertise and sophisticated motor servicing facility. Management is optimistic that the Atlas Power division will see expanded activity and a growing client base during the course of the 2018-year. The high margin division will mainly target operators in the Permian basin where there are a large number of rigs operating, but could be scalable to any basin throughout North America.\nThe 2018 program will also support growth within PHX Energy’s full service operations, which is placing greater demand on the Corporation’s fleet. With the continued strengthening of crude oil prices driving industry rig counts upward, PHX Energy’s US operations are gaining more work from both new and existing clients, again primarily in the Permian basin, and Management anticipates its Canadian operations to be more active coming out of spring break-up.\nAs the Corporation expands its operations, it will continue to take a disciplined approach toward this growth and believes the increase to the 2018 program will aid in further improvements in profitability and strengthen PHX Energy’s financial position. The 2018 program is expected to be financed from a combination of cash flow from operations and the Corporation’s unused credit facilities.\nAbout PHX Energy Services Corp.\nThe Corporation, through its directional drilling subsidiary entities, provides horizontal and directional drilling technology and services to oil and natural gas producing companies in Canada, the US, Russia and Albania. PHX Energy also provides EDR technology and services.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this document constitute \"forward looking statements\" and/or \"forward looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws (collectively referred to as \"forward looking statements\").
