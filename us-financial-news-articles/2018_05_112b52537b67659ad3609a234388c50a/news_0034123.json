Trump’s move has fired Palestinian anger and drawn criticism from many foreign governments as a setback to peace efforts.\nMelissa Knapp, Avi, and David Bronstein protest outside of Trump International Hotel against the new U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem in Washington, U.S., May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis The Washington protest was the second against the Gaza violence by IfNotNow, which urges U.S. Jewish groups to end their support of Israel’s policies toward the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel’s actions on the Gaza border fence, the site of month-long protests, were self-defense against the enclave’s ruling Hamas movement.\nThirty-seven IfNotNow protesters were arrested in six cities last month, including at the offices of U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Ben Cardin of Maryland, the group said.\n“Our question is, ‘Which side are you on?’” spokesman Yonah Lieberman said by phone, adding that the group would not be lobbying Congress about the embassy move.\n“We’re trying to move the megapublic,” Lieberman added. “We don’t believe the people on Capitol Hill are the ones that will transform the Jewish community.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Lieberman and Brammer-Shlay cited a 2017 poll by the American Jewish Committee advocacy group that showed 80 percent of U.S. Jews surveyed were against the embassy move, or favored it at a later date in conjunction with Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.\nReporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Scott Malone and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:41:06.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
