Macron urged Trump to continue with the deal, when the two met in Washington last week.\nMacron also condemned rioting by anarchists at Tuesday’s annual May Day rally in Paris. French police arrested more than 200 people in the French capital after anarchists hijacked the rally by labour unions against Macron’s economic reforms.
