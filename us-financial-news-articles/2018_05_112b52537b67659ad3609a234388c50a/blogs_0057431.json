Another group was given free stop-smoking aids like gum, patches, and lozenges (2.9% of those quit). A third group received free e-cigarettes — electronic devices that vaporize nicotine — of the flavor of their choice (4.8% of those stopped smoking).\nTwo other groups received an added bonus: cash.\nOne group received both stop-smoking items and a cash reward: $100 after the first month, a $200 bonus at the three month mark, and $300 more at the six month mark. In the end 9.5% of them quit.\nThe other was given any stop-smoking product they wanted, and the threat that $600 in an account would be taken away if they smoked. A whopping 12.7% made it to the six month mark.\nHalf of those who reached the six month mark continued to abstain from smoking for a year.\n“People are much more motivated to avoid losing $100 than they are to gain $100, even though, economically, they are flip sides of the same coin,” Halpern told Reuters.\nThe study comes at a time when the effectiveness of e-cigarettes in helping people quite smoking is being debated. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes, it warns that there are still risks associated with them because they contain “cancer-causing agents.”\n“E-cigarettes are not currently approved by the FDA as a quit smoking aid,” according to the CDC . “The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a group of health experts that makes recommendations about preventive health care, has concluded that evidence is insufficient to recommend e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women.”\nIn Halpern’s view, the results of the study show that “we cannot detect any evidence that [e-cigarettes] are better than offering free conventional smoking cessation aids or just providing information.”\nCritics of the study told CBS News that the study didn’t actually show that e-cigarettes weren’t useful, but just compared it to other methods.\nThe results also gives employees a better sense of how much it would cost to get employees to stop smoking.\n“The best estimates are, it costs $3,000 to $6,000 more per year to employ a smoker rather than a non-smoker,” Halpern told Reuters. “So even if these programs cost $800 to $1000, they would be highly cost-saving from the standpoint of the employer and the insurer.”\nThe study was sponsored by employee wellness company Vitality Group.
