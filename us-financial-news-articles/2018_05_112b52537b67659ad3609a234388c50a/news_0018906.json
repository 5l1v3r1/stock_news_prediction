Chinese state media said Xi reiterated China’s support for a U.S.-North Korea summit.\nChinese state television said Xi said he “hopes the United States and North Korea can build mutual trust, synchronize actions, resolve each sides’ concerns through meeting and consultations, consider North Korea’s reasonable security concerns, and jointly promote the political resolution process to the Korean peninsula issue.” Related Coverage North Korea's Kim 'very pleased' relationship with China at a high point: media\nIn the past North Korea has used the term “hostile policies” in reference to the U.S. troop presence in South Korea, the U.S. nuclear umbrella covering South Korea and Japan and regular joint military exercises in South Korea.\nChina is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, but Beijing has been angered by Pyongyang’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and supported tough U.N. sanctions against its Cold War-era ally.\nThe two sides have stepped up engagement since Trump surprised the world in March by saying he would be willing to meet Kim in a bid to resolve the crisis over Pyongyang’s development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. SMILING KIM ACCOMPANIED BY SISTER\nKim was accompanied to China by his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who has played a leading role in diplomatic overtures by the long-isolated country.\nChinese state media showed pictures of Kim smiling in an outdoors meeting with Xi, and the two leaders strolling along a waterfront.\nXi hosted a banquet and told Kim of his backing of North Korea’s “strategic shift towards economic development”, Xinhua added.\n“China supports North Korea’s upholding of denuclearization on the peninsula, and supports North Korea and the United States resolving the peninsula issue through dialogue and consultation,” Xi said.

REUTERS/Kwak Sung-Kyung\nNorth Korean state media said Kim was “very pleased” that the relationship with China was reaching a high point, and North Korea would cooperate with China more actively as the situation on the Korean peninsula changed.\nThe two leaders “opened their hearts and had warm conversations,” North Korea’s state news agency KCNA reported. LATEST SUMMIT\nThe meeting was the latest in a series by North Korean leaders and follows Kim’s historic summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month.\nIn March, Kim traveled by train to Beijing, his first known trip abroad since assuming power in 2011.\nKim used his official aircraft to make the short flight to Dalian, in what was his first known international flight since assuming power.\nKim’s father, Kim Jong Il, feared flying, fuelling speculation that the younger Kim may not be willing to travel far to meet Trump. The venue for their summit has not been announced.\nThe demilitarized zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea, and Singapore are believed to be the most likely contenders for the venue.\nSouth Korea’s presidential office said the Chinese government notified Seoul about the Xi-Kim meeting in advance.\nIntense secrecy typically surrounds high-level North Korean visits to China, and this week’s trip was no different. Slideshow (2 Images)\nThroughout the day on Tuesday there was speculation on Chinese websites that a North Korean leader was in China, though China’s foreign ministry said earlier it had no information and Chinese state media did not carry any reports.\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK had shown images of two North Korean aircraft taxiing at Dalian’s airport, one an Air Koryo plane and another carrying a North Korean emblem.\nPosts about unusual traffic jams and security in Dalian popped up on Chinese social media.
