REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay But, while lavish in her praise for the 40-year-old Macron since he swept to power a year ago, the German chancellor is ironically proving the biggest obstacle to his ambitions for a more politically and economically integrated Europe.\nMacron will receive the award - given out annually since 1950 - at a ceremony rich in symbolism in the Coronation room of Aachen town hall in Germany. Aachen was the residence of Charlemagne, often called the “father of Europe”, who managed to unite much of western Europe in the early ninth century.\nThe French leader impressed the prize committee with his “vision of a new Europe and the re-establishment of the European project”. In their citation, they call Macron “a head of state with a claim to European leadership”.\nFrancois Mitterand was the last sitting French president to receive the award, winning it jointly with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1988.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) reacts as he arrives to get a Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, Germany May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay Merkel, the longest serving European Union leader, sometimes dubbed the “Queen of Europe”, has demonstrated her personal esteem for Macron in agreeing to deliver the “laudation”. She herself received the prize in 2008.\nYet she has largely poured cold water on Macron’s ideas for reviving the EU, which include a stand-alone budget for the single currency bloc, a single finance minister, and other steps to reinforce economic and monetary union.\nSlideshow (3 Images) POLITELY AT ODDS While the two leaders continue to promote common initiatives on migration, defense and security, they are politely at odds when it comes to economics and finance, with Merkel reluctant to take steps that could be construed as Germany bearing greater liability for other euro zone countries’ problems.\nThe euro zone often looks to France and Germany, the twin “motors” of Europe, to take the lead on reform plans. In that vein, Macron and Merkel have promised to come up with specific proposals ahead of a summit in June.\nBut little progress has been made and officials close to Macron say he has lowered his ambitions, despite having made Europe a central plank of his presidency.\nMerkel has sought to paper over gaps in their positions.\n“Since taking office he has, with much elan, with much hope, provided Europe with important impetus,” she said in her weekly podcast.\nOn Monday, Merkel said France and Germany agreed on “most fundamental issues related to Europe” even if they had different “emphases” about how to proceed.\nMacron — as well as many others — will be listening closely to Merkel’s speech on Thursday for signs that she is prepared to meet him at least half way on his EU ambitions.\nWriting by Luke Baker; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:18:32.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
