The field has initial natural gas reserves of 23 billion cubic metres, according to the statement.\nBlock 06.1 is 370 kms (230 miles) southeast of Vietnam’s coast and is not close to the U-shaped “nine-dash line” that marks the vast area of the South China Sea claimed by China, where the two countries have been embroiled in maritime disputes.\nIn March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China, sources told Reuters.\nThe block is licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol , which has asked Vietnam to pay compensation over the issue.\nIn April, Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam admitted that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year.\nThe Lan Do gas field drilling will be undertaken using the Hakuryu-5 equipment made by Japanese company Japan Drilling Co., Ltd, Rosneft said in the statement.\nWith sanctions barring Russia’s largest oil producer from offshore extraction with Western companies, Rosneft is looking to its operations in Vietnam for the experience needed to expand its global reach.\nRosneft said that production offshore Vietnam is very profitable. Operational costs to produce gas stand at $1.5 per barrel of oil equivalent, half of what it usually costs the company.
