There are an estimated 8 million war victims, 7 million of whom are displaced. One Marxist guerrilla group and myriad crime gangs remain active.\n“Today we are taking a new step in the construction of peace and in respect of the rights of victims,” President Juan Manuel Santos said at a ceremony to mark the start of the commission’s work. “Many victims, and I have talked to hundreds of them, maybe thousands, many times they don’t even ask for reparations, what they want is truth.”\nThe commission will not be able to hear about every injustice, Santos said, because there are simply too many after such a long conflict, but it will help “to heal wounds.”\nBesides public hearings, the commission will also facilitate private meetings between victims and perpetrators. Hearings and meetings will take place across the country and the commission will report publicly on their work every six months.\nThe commission is one of a trio of organizations started under the peace accord intended to provide victims with judicial redress and investigative help, no matter whether they were victimized by rebels, paramilitaries or state security forces.\nThe Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal will try FARC leaders and military officials for war crimes and can dole out five-to-eight-year sentences of restorative work such as rebuilding roads or schools for those who accept responsibility.\nEx-fighters who lie or do not tell the whole truth but are later convicted could receive harsher sentences of between five and 20 years in regular prisons.\nA special investigative unit will focus on looking for the remains of tens of thousands of people who disappeared during the conflict and providing families with information about what happened to loved ones.
