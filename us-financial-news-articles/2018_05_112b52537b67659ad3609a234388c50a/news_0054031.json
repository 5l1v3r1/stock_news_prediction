People wearing masks are seen at a hospital in Kozhikode in the southern state of Kerala, India May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer\nThe UAE’s Ministry of Climate Change and Environment also notified other local authorities, including the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority and the municipalities of its emirates, to prevent the entry of any fresh produce from Kerala, it said in a statement.\nThe ministry suspects that fruit bats are the source of the virus. It said it was banning fresh produce, including mangoes, dates and bananas - the bats’ preferred fruits.\nIndian health officials have not been able to trace the origin of the Nipah outbreak and have begun a fresh round of tests on fruit bats from Perambra, the suspected epicentre of the infection.\nKerala has sent 116 suspected cases for testing in recent weeks, 15 have been confirmed with the deadly disease and 13 of these people have died, with two patients still undergoing treatment.\nNo confirmed cases of the virus have been found outside the state.\nThere is no vaccine for the virus, which is spread through body fluids and can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\nLast week, the UAE consulate in Kerala advised travellers to take precautions and follow safety instructions issued by the Indian authorities.\nThe Gulf state has also banned imports of live animals from South Africa, based on a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) of the registration of Rift Valley Fever disease, the ministry said.\nSouth Africa’s Department of Agriculture said on May 16 that an outbreak of the disease had been confirmed in sheep on a single farm in the central Free State province and that further investigations were being conducted. Officials could not be reached on Tuesday to provide updates.\nThe disease is spread by mosquitoes and the department said its potential to spread was reduced by the onset of the dry winter season in the region.\nHumans can be infected with Rift Valley Fever if contact is made with the blood or other body fluids of a diseased animal.
