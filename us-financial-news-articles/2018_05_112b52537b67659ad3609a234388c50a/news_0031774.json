But the conflict is years away from being resolved.”\nUnder the terms of the legislation that allowed for Madrid to take over the regional government, direct rule will be lifted once the new administration has been formed with all cabinet members named.\nPro-independence parties won a majority of seats in regional elections called in December by Rajoy. However, the biggest single party was Ciudadanos (“Citizens”), which favours unity with Spain.
