ATR is a joint venture between Airbus and Italian group Leonardo.\nAirbus said it had no immediate comment on the matter.\nFakhrieh-Kashan was quoted earlier as saying Airbus would announce soon whether it would sell planes to Tehran after the United States - which must approve the export of planes with a significant number of U.S. parts - said it would withdraw from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.\nWhite House National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier this week that there would be “wind-down” periods of 90 to 180 days, and perhaps other durations, for existing Iranian contracts with companies, following President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the 2015 Iran deal.
