He told CNBC Make It that there \"is not damage-control\" for any business-owner who goes on a very public racist rant.\nNow, in the wake of Schlossberg's apology, O'Leary tells CNBC Make It that the \"mea culpa\" should only be the first step if the lawyer wants to repair his reputation.\n\"Admitting this is unacceptable to anyone, apologizing and asking for forgiveness are good first steps,\" O'Leary says. \"But actions, not words, are going to be what others will be measuring going forward.\"\nTWEET\n\"If you go on a racist rant, you've finished your career pretty well. And, if that's who you really are, your career should be finished,\" O'Leary said on Thursday.\nAfter social media users identified Schlossberg as the man in the video, a Yelp page for his law firm, the Law Office of Aaron M. Schlossberg, was bombarded with one-star reviews from users commenting on his viral rant. Yelp even had to suspend reviews on the firm with a note saying the page is undergoing an \"active cleanup alert,\" as a result of the flood of posts reacting to Schlossberg's news coverage.\nshow chapters Kevin O'Leary shares his No. 1 trick for tipping at a restaurant 11:48 AM ET Wed, 14 March 2018 | 00:47 CNBC Make It asked O'Leary if he expects the law firm's reputation to rebound from such negative exposure. But the \"Shark Tank\" star had little in the way of encouragement for Schlossberg.\n\"You know, that guy's an idiot,\" O'Leary said bluntly. \"I'm not sure he's coming back. If that's really how he thinks about people, he doesn't deserve to come back.\"\nO'Leary added that while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, you have to be careful about how you voice that opinion. \"Those that go on rants, any kind of a rant — look, you deserve to say what you like, but you have to be respectful,\" he said. \"And when you say things that are racist or sexist, you're just an idiot.\"\nThe entrepreneur and investor also said that business owners must always be mindful of the power and scope of social media, which O'Leary noted \"can broadcast all of the good things you say, but more importantly it can also broadcast all of the mistakes you make.\"\nAfter all, \"what goes digital stays out there forever,\" he said.\n\"Think about what you're saying and who you're saying it to with the assumption that somebody's listening, somebody's watching and somebody will post it,\" O'Leary told CNBC Make It. \"That's just the digital world we live in today.\"\nSchlossberg discovered the perils of online infamy last week after tens of thousands of people shared a smartphone video showing him berating Spanish-speaking employees in the midtown Manhattan restaurant Fresh Kitchen. The video shows the lawyer threatening to call federal immigration authorities to have the employees in question \"kicked out of my country.\"\nSchlossberg has also been captured in other videos that surfaced recently in which he angrily confronted strangers.\nThis is an updated version of a previously published story .\nDon't miss:\nKevin O'Leary spends $3,000 a year on haircuts — here's why\nKevin O'Leary: Here's how much an MBA matters in business\nLike this story?
