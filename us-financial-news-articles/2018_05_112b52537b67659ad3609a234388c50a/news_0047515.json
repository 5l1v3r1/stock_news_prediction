She said her health worsened, leading to her resignation.\n\"For years, she wanted to help make Uber a safe and just place to work for herself and other female employees,\" Avendano's lawyer Jennifer Schwartz, a partner at Outten & Golden, said in a statement.\nUber changed its forced-arbitration policy on May 15, and rival Lyft announced a similar change.\nEarlier Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court said companies can in employment contracts require workers to arbitrate rather than pursue class-action claims over workplace matters.\nIn March, Uber reached a $10 million settlement of a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging discrimination against more than 400 women and minorities. Avendano chose not to join that settlement, deciding to sue on her own.\nUber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi has since his August appointment tried to improve the company's image, including by stamping out its reputation as tolerant of chauvinism.\nAvendano, who is Hispanic, is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for her gender bias, racial bias, and harassment claims. She filed her lawsuit with the California Superior Court in San Francisco.\nThe case is Avendano v Uber Technologies Inc, California Superior Court, San Francisco County, No. CGC-18-566677 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:45:32.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
