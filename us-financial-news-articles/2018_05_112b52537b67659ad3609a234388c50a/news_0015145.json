Slideshow (2 Images)\nTrump nominated Haspel, who would be the first woman to lead the intelligence agency, to succeed Mike Pompeo, who has become secretary of state.\nCritics of Haspel’s nomination have taken issue with her role in a defunct programme in which the CIA detained and interrogated al Qaeda suspects in secret prisons abroad using techniques, including waterboarding, widely condemned as torture.\nFormer President George W. Bush authorized the Rendition, Detention and Interrogation Program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nMany details of Haspel’s work remain classified. Sources familiar with her career who requested anonymity said she was at one point the chief of the CIA station in a country where harsh interrogations were used on at least one terrorism suspect.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Haspel “is 100 percent committed to going through this confirmation process and being confirmed as the next leader of the CIA.” Reporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Peter Cooney", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T23:08:19.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
