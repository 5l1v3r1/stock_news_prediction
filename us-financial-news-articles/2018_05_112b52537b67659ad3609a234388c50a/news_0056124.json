BBY -6.65% believes it needs to stock more inventory if it wants to sell more electronics.\nThe electronics giant reported its inventories rose ahead of even its fast-surging sales in its most recent quarter, as the company sought to drive more sales by having goods in place both online and in its physical stores even at the expense of higher supply-chain costs.\nBest Buy reported overall sales rose 6.8% to $9.12 billion, part of a strong report issued Thursday that showed Best Buy growing at a sharp rate on improving consumer confidence and a lineup of popular new products.\nInventories on its balance sheet in the quarter ended May 5 reached $4.96 billion, up 7.1% from the end of last year’s fiscal first quarter, and inventories on a per-square-foot basis—an important measure of supply-chain efficiency for retailers—were up 9% from a year ago.\nRead More on Logistics\nBest Buy Keeps Store Shelves, Distribution Centers Stocked May 24, 2018 Union Pacific Chief Praises GE-Wabtec Railroad Deal May 23, 2018 Paying More to Save More: Companies Boosting Salaries for Supply-Chain Executives May 18, 2018 Best Buy Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry said the figures show the company is getting its inventories lined up with an “improved customer experience,” which means having goods available wherever consumers are shopping, even if that increases short-term supply-chain costs.\n“We absolutely have built inventory in line with the sales figures that we’ve been seeing,” Ms. Barry said in a conference call with investors.\n“We have found it to be very much in our advantage to make sure we have the inventory there for our customers,” she added.\nGetting the right amount of goods in the right place has become a growing concern for retailers as online sales have exploded, undercutting longstanding strategies aimed at keeping supply chain costs down by keeping stocks lean.\nNewsletter Sign-up Many store owners are wrestling with the need to have inventory on hand in stores and at warehouses for online fulfillment, and retailers including Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. have turned to having their stores do double duty by shipping online orders from the sites or having customers pick up their orders at the sites.\nBest Buy is undertaking what the company calls a “multiyear transformation” of its supply chain, which will include more automation and more distribution centers closer to population centers. The retailer says increased investments in supply chain and higher transportation costs are expected to pressure the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points each quarter for the remainder of the year.\nBest Buy is seeing its in-store pickup grow. But its first quarterly results suggest the retailer believes it needs to have goods both on shelves and in fulfillment centers helps drive sales.\n“I do fundamentally believe that there is a need amongst consumers to touch, feel” goods to make final decisions, Ms. Barry said, particularly for expensive items with new technology.\nWrite to Paul Page at paul.page@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T04:26:07.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
