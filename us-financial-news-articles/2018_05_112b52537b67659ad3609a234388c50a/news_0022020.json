Olson (@Cinemixtape) May 2, 2018\nIn addition to plastering Solo: A Star Wars Story on its packaging, Solo (the company) made a Solo (the man) reusable cup , a Han Solo Cup t-shirt, and debuted a sweepstakes with prizes including Han Solo-branded merchandise, Fandango tickets, and a trip to the movie’s premiere. The company has also dedicated its website to the Star Wars brand , encouraging people to have a “Solobration.”\n“Part of SOLO’s innovation roadmap is to enhance our relationship with consumers on a more personal level,” Kimberly Healy, Solo’s vice president of consumer products marketing and innovation, said in a statement. “What better way to do that than by strengthening the obvious ties between, and love for, the SOLO brand and Star Wars ?”\nLylle Breier, senior vice president for global marketing partnerships at Walt Disney Studios, said in a press release that Solo, along with five other promotional partners for Solo: a Star Wars Story that include Denny’s and Nissan, “have done a fantastic job developing first-class, innovative campaigns in support of the film.”\nFortune contacted both Solo, Disney and Lucasfilm for more specifics about the deal including any financial arrangements, and will update as needed.\nAnd we don’t think that the generally unsentimental Han Solo would mind the obvious brand play with Solo cups. After all, as he said in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope: “I ain’t in this for your revolution. I’m not in it for you Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for the money.” (It certainly makes more sense than previous Star Wars branded items like iceberg lettuce or fruit.)\nSolo: A Star Wars Story stars Alden Ehrenreich, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Thandie Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Joonas Suotamo, and Paul Bettany. It premieres in U.S. theaters on May 25.
