(“TRHC”) (NASDAQ:TRHC), a healthcare technology company advancing the field of medication safety, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“The momentum we experienced at the end of last year has continued, resulting in a very strong start for Tabula Rasa in 2018,” said Calvin H. Knowlton, PhD, TRHC’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Once again, we saw solid performance across all of our business metrics in the first quarter, and we continued to raise awareness with respect to our solutions and their potential benefits to the broader healthcare industry. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we launched our Optimized Opioid Solution to predict and prevent unintentional opioid abuse, directly addressing one of the most critical health concerns in America today.”\nDr. Knowlton continued, “Opportunities stemming from our September 2017 acquisition of SinfoníaRx have continued to unfold as we gain access to additional health plan customers and expand our MRM solution into this new market. Furthermore, we believe the favorable regulatory changes coming out of Washington related to the opioid misuse epidemic, as well as changes to the recognition of MTM expenses in the Medicare Part D program will positively impact our business, and we look forward to the multitude of opportunities ahead of us.”\nFinancial Performance for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nEffective January 1, 2018, TRHC adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\", utilizing the full retrospective transition method. All 2017 financial results have been adjusted to reflect the change. Additional details regarding the new revenue recognition policy and its effect on TRHC’s financial results will be available in TRHC’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2018.\nAll comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal revenue was $43.9 million, an increase of 57.1%. Total revenue included product revenue of $27.2 million, an increase of 23.9% largely driven by expansion from existing clients and the onboarding of a new client in the first quarter. Service revenue was $16.8 million, an increase 177.7% that was driven by expanded services offered to existing clients as well as the contribution of the SinfoníaRx (“SRx”) business which was acquired in September of 2017. SRx generated revenue of $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, was 27.9% compared to 29.7% in 2017. The year-over-year decrease was in line with management’s expectations as the SRx business had a gross margin of less than 30% in the first quarter which is consistent with its historical performance. The lower gross margin in the first quarter results from a qualification period in which health plan members are notified of their eligibility for the medication therapy management benefit and fewer medication reviews are completed as compared to the remaining quarters in the year. TRHC maintains a long-term gross margin target, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, of 35% to 40% over the next three to five years. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $4.3 million compared to $3.3 million, an increase of 31.5%. The increase in Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by new and existing client growth in both the PACE market and health plan market. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.8%, down slightly from 11.7%, and was in line with management’s expectation given the limited margin contribution from SRx in the first quarter. Net loss of $18.1 million compared to a net loss of $2.6 million. This net loss was significantly impacted by a charge of $13.5 million due to the change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration for the SRx acquisition. Under ASC 805, “Business Combinations”, contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured at the end of each reporting period to their respective fair values until the contingency is resolved with those changes flowing through earnings. Given the sensitivity of the SRx contingent consideration payment calculation, this remeasurement can produce significant impacts to GAAP net income (loss) that are not reflective of current operating results. The charge recognized in the first quarter of 2018 increased the amount of contingent consideration TRHC expects to pay in connection with the acquisition. This was the result of an increase in the projected EBITDA multiple used to calculate the contingent consideration which may be earned based on SRx’s 2018 financial results and varies based on TRHC’s EBITDA trading multiple. As of March 31, 2018, the SRx contingent consideration liability was $45.3 million with the potential for up to an additional $39.7 million to be earned if the maximum contingent amount is earned, which would flow through as a charge to GAAP net income (loss). Any decreases in the contingent amount will be recorded as GAAP net income. The actual amount of the contingent consideration will be known as of December 31, 2018. Net loss per diluted share was $0.96, compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.16. The net loss per share calculations were based on a diluted share count of 18.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 16.2 million shares for the same period in 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.10, compared to Non-GAAP Adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.08. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $4.3 million compared to $10.4 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the final contingent consideration payment made in connection with the 2014 acquisition of Medliance of $1.6 million and $2.9 million used in the share repurchase program. TRHC had $39.6 million available under its line of credit at the end of the first quarter.\nA reconciliation of generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States to non-GAAP results has been provided in this press release in the accompanying tables. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\nFinancial Outlook\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance: Revenue for TRHC’s second quarter in 2018 is expected to be in the range of $46 million to $47 million. Net income is expected to be in the range of $0.4 million to $0.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $6.0 million to $6.5 million.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance: Revenue for fiscal year 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $188 million to $198 million. TRHC now expects a net loss in the range of $7.4 million to $11.4 million. The net loss projection for 2018 does not include any tax effects related to the vesting of restricted stock issued at the time of the initial public offering in the second quarter, the amount will be dependent upon TRHC’s stock price on May 31, 2018. Additionally, any further charges or benefits related to adjustments in contingent consideration with respect to the SinfoníaRx acquisition are not factored in this guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $28.0 million to $32.0 million.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nAs previously announced, TRHC will hold a conference call with members of executive management to discuss its first quarter 2018 performance today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET. Stockholders and interested participants may listen to a live broadcast of the conference call by dialing 844-413-0947 or 216-562-0423 for international callers, and referencing participant code 1578756 approximately 15 minutes prior to the call. A live webcast of the conference call will be available on the investor relations section of TRHC’s website ( ir.trhc.com ) and an audio file of the call will also be archived and available for replay approximately two hours after the live event for a period of 90 days thereafter at ir.trhc.com . After the conference call, a replay will be available until May 15, 2018 and can be accessed by dialing 855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406 for international callers, and referencing participant code 1578756.\nAbout Tabula Rasa HealthCare\nTRHC (NASDAQ:TRHC) is a leader in providing patient-specific, data-driven technology and solutions that enable healthcare organizations to optimize medication regimens to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs and manage risk.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net loss plus certain other expenses, which includes interest expense, provision for income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense, acquisition-related expense, payroll tax expense related to stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense. TRHC defines Adjusted Diluted EPS as net loss attributable to common stockholders before fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expense, payroll tax expense related to stock option exercises, stock-based compensation expense, and the tax impact of those items as well as adjustments for tax benefits related to the recognition of tax windfall benefits expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. TRHC believes the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the company’s underlying operations results and trends and allows for comparability with TRHC’s peer company index and industry and to be more consistent with TRHC’s expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Please note that other companies might define their non-GAAP financial measures differently than TRHC does.\nTRHC presents these non-GAAP financial measures in this release because it considers them to be important supplemental measures of performance. TRHC uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including analysis of the company's performance against prior periods, the preparation of operating budgets and determination of appropriate levels of operating and capital investments. TRHC believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's financial and operational performance. TRHC also intends to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of the company's future earnings discussions and, therefore, their inclusion should provide consistency in the company's financial reporting.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures provided in this release, including in the accompanying tables.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements that we believe to be reasonable as of today’s date.
