Chloe joining the team is a critical piece in implementing the infrastructure and team on the ground in order to accomplish these ambitious goals.”\nChloe Ross joins ClassPass with nearly two decades of strategy and operating experience across the tech, policy and corporate sectors, including international strategy at Microsoft and developing policy in the UK Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit.
