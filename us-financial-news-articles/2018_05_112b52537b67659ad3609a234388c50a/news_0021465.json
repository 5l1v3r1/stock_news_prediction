In addition, the company plans to continue its history of profitable growth, creating jobs, further expanding its global footprint, and pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions—all with the overarching purpose of better serving the international business requirements of its prestigious and ever-growing client base.\nMr. Shawe’s litigation team was led by Kruzhkov Russo PLLC; Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman; and Finger & Slanina.
