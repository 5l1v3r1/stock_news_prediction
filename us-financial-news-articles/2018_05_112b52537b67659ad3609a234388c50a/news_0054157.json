But Mattarella’s aides also made it known he did not want the economist Paolo Savona to become economy minister.\nOn Thursday, the leaders of the 5-Star Movement and League parties that are backing the nascent coalition government defended Savona and said they wanted him in the cabinet.\nIt’s “unacceptable” that there be any sort of “diktat” that limits the powers of the president and prime minister-designate to choose the members of the future government, the source said.\nReporting by Massimiliano Di Giorgio; writing by Steve Scherer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:25:40.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
