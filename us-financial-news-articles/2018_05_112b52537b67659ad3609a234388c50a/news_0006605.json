(NASDAQ:FOXF) (“FOX” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nSales increased 22.1% to $129.8 million compared to $106.3 million in the same period last fiscal year\nGross margin increased 40 basis points to 32.1% compared to 31.7% in the same period last fiscal year\nNet income was $21.5 million, or 16.6% of sales and $0.55 per diluted share, compared to net income of $10.5 million, or 9.8% of sales and $0.27 per diluted share in the same period last fiscal year.\nIncluded in net income is a one-time benefit of $9.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, related to the favorable conclusion of the Company’s 2015 IRS audit. This one-time benefit is excluded from non-GAAP earnings per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income was $14.1 million, or $0.36 adjusted earnings per diluted share, compared to $13.6 million, or $0.35 adjusted earnings per diluted share in the same period last fiscal year\nAdjusted EBITDA was $23.0 million, or 17.7% of sales, compared to $19.3 million, or 18.1% of sales in the same period last fiscal year\n“We started the year with record quarterly sales driven by strength in both our powered vehicle and bike offerings resulting in sales and profitability above our expectations,” commented Larry L. Enterline, FOX's Chief Executive Officer. “Looking ahead, our team remains committed to further building FOX’s brand presence in our existing powered vehicle and bike categories and we believe FOX’s differentiated market position will continue to fuel our expansion in the diverse end markets we serve.”\nSales for fiscal 2018 were $129.8 million, an increase of 22.1% as compared to sales of $106.3 million in fiscal 2017. This increase reflects a 33.5% increase in sales of powered vehicle products and a 10.3% increase in sales of bike products. The increase in sales of powered vehicle products was due to the inclusion of the Company’s recent acquisition of Tuscany as well as continued high demand for on and off-road suspension products. The increase in bike product sales was primarily due to the continued success of the Company’s model year product line up, particularly in the OEM channel.\nGross margin was 32.1% for fiscal 2018, a 40 basis point increase from gross margin of 31.7% in fiscal 2017. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and increased volume.\nTotal operating expenses were $25.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $21.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of operating costs relating to our newly acquired Tuscany subsidiary, investments in research and development to support future growth, professional services costs associated with patent litigation and tax reform, and higher amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related compensation due to the conclusion of the Company’s acquisition-related compensation arrangements.\nAs a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 19.8% for fiscal 2018 compared to 20.1% in fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $22.4 million, or 17.3% of sales in fiscal 2018 compared to $18.0 million, or 16.9% of sales, in the prior fiscal year. Reconciliations of operating expense to non-GAAP operating expense are provided at the end of this press release.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was a benefit of 44.2%, or $6.6 million, for fiscal 2018. This includes a one-time benefit of $9.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, due to the release of tax related liabilities for matters resolved in connection with the Company’s 2015 IRS audit. Exclusive of the benefit, the Company’s effective tax rate was 20.9% in fiscal 2018.\nNet income in fiscal 2018 was $21.5 million, compared to net income of $10.5 million in the prior fiscal year. Earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2018 was $0.55, compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.27 for fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2018 was $23.0 million, compared to $19.3 million in fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin in fiscal 2018 was 17.7%, compared to 18.1% in fiscal 2017. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of adjusted EBITDA margin are provided at the end of this press release.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income was $14.1 million, or $0.36 adjusted earnings per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $13.6 million, or $0.35 adjusted earnings per diluted share in the same period of last fiscal year. Reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share are provided at the end of this press release.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of March 30, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $22.2 million compared to $35.9 million as of December 29, 2017. Total debt was $79.2 million, compared to $98.6 million as of December 29, 2017, reflecting pay down of debt incurred for the Company’s 2017 acquisition of Tuscany. Inventory was $91.3 million as of March 30, 2018, compared to $84.8 million as of December 29, 2017. As of March 30, 2018, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $56.8 million and $47.0 million, respectively, compared to December 29, 2017 balances of $61.1 million and $40.8 million, respectively. The changes in inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are primarily attributable to business growth and the Company’s normal seasonality.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects sales in the range of $141 million to $149 million and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.43 to $0.49.\nFor the fiscal year 2018, the Company expects sales in the range of $555 million to $575 million and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.72 to $1.86 The Company’s full year 2018 guidance assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 21%.\nNon-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share exclude the following items net of applicable tax: amortization of purchased intangibles, contingent consideration valuation adjustment, acquisition-related compensation expense including related foreign currency transaction gains and losses, certain acquisition-related adjustments and expenses, litigation-related expenses, offering expenses, and costs related to tax restructuring initiatives. Additionally, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share excludes the tax benefit related to the resolution of audits by taxing authorities. A quantitative reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2018 is not available without unreasonable efforts because management cannot predict, with sufficient certainty, all of the elements necessary to provide such a reconciliation.\nConference Call & Webcast\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).

NASDAQ Global Select Market is a registered trademark of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. All rights reserved.\nIn addition to reporting financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), FOX is including in this press release “non-GAAP operating expense”, “non-GAAP adjusted net income”, “non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share”, “adjusted EBITDA”, and “adjusted EBITDA margin”, which are non- . FOX defines non-GAAP operating expense as operating expense adjusted for amortization of purchased intangibles, contingent consideration valuation adjustments, acquisition related compensation expense, costs of its secondary and shelf offerings, acquisition related operating expenses, litigation-related costs, and costs related to tax restructuring initiatives. FOX defines non-GAAP adjusted net income as net income attributable to FOX Stockholders adjusted for amortization of purchased intangibles, contingent consideration valuation adjustments, acquisition related compensation expense including related foreign currency transaction gains and losses, costs of its secondary and shelf offerings, acquisition related expenses, litigation-related costs, and costs related to tax restructuring initiatives, all net of applicable tax, as well as tax impacts arising from the settlement of audit and the recognition of related tax positions and tax reform legislation impacts. These adjustments are more fully described in the tables included at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share is defined as non-GAAP adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding during the period. FOX defines adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, net other expense, income taxes, amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation, stock-based compensation, offering expense, contingent consideration valuation adjustments, acquisition related compensation expense including related foreign currency transaction gains and losses, litigation-related costs, and certain other acquisition related costs that are more fully described in the tables included at the end of this press release. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.\nFOX includes these non- because it believes they allow investors to understand and evaluate the Company’s core operating performance and trends. In particular, the exclusion of certain items in calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA (and accordingly, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA margin) can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core business. These non- have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that such non- may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies because other companies may calculate non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin differently than FOX does.
