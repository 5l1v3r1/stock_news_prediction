Since then we have had no report on the situation in the district,” said Mansoor Faqiri, a member of the Ghazni provincial council.\nReporting by Mustafa Andalib in GHAZNI, Storay Karimi in HERAT, James Mackenzie in FARAH and Qadir Sediqi in KABUL; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T15:16:19.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
