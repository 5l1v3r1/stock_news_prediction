We have expressed an interest. If they don’t want to be bought by IAG, fine,” Walsh said. “I am not going to do anything hostile, that’s not my style.” Reporting by Victoria Bryan, editing by Sarah Young", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:29:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
