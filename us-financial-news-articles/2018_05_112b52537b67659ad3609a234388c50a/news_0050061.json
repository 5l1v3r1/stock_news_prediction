Also jockeying for a piece of the lucrative market are drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca, which are advancing their rival immunotherapies.\nMerck said the new data will be shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of its push to expand the drug’s label, and would be presented at an upcoming medical conference, the company said.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:46:26.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
