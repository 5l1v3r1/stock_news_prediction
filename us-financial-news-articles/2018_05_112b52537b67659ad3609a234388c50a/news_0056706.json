Mandatory Credit: Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sports A pending misdemeanor marijuana case in Alabama was dropped on Friday after Foster completed a diversion program, according to 49ers beat writer Matt Barrows.\n“Per Tuscaloosa district attorney’s office, Reuben Foster’s misdemeanor marijuana case there has been dismissed after he completed a diversion course there,” Barrow tweeted.\nFoster joined the club’s voluntary organized team activities in Santa Clara, Calif. on Thursday, the first time he was with the team in an official capacity in more than a month.\nOn Wednesday, Santa Clara (Calif.) County Judge Nona L. Klippen dropped two felony domestic violence charges against Foster. A week earlier, Foster’s ex-girlfriend had recanted her Feb. 11 accusation that he hit her in the head eight to 10 times, causing facial bruises and a ruptured eardrum.\nElissa Ennis told that court that she lied about Foster after he broke up with her, trying to ruin his career and “end him.”\nEnnis won’t face charges for making false statements. According to the Sacramento Bee, the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s office issued a statement that read: “We don’t charge domestic violence victims who falsely recant. We empathize with them, we support them, and we advocate for them.”\nFoster’s legal troubles aren’t completely behind him. He still faces a pre-trial hearing in Santa Clara on June 6 for an assault-weapon change that was reduced to a misdemeanor from a felony.\nIn addition, the NFL could discipline Foster under its personal-conduct policy.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:20:16.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
