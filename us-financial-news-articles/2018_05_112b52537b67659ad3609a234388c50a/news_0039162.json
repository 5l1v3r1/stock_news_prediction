Under the currency peg, the HKMA is obliged to intervene when the Hong Kong dollar hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact.\nAs the former British colony pegs its currency to the dollar, its money market rates should mirror those of its U.S. counterpart, but the gap has now widened to around one percent since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates from ultra-low levels adopted during the 2008 financial crisis.
