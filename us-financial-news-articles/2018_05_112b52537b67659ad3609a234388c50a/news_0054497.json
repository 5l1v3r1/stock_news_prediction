He did not provide further details.\nHe also said the British ambassador in Tehran had spoken to Zaghari-Ratcliffe last Sunday.\n“We remain of the assessment that a private, rather than public approach is most likely to result in progress in Nazanin’s case and ultimately, her release, which is all any of us want,” he said.\nIran does not recognize dual citizenship, which limits the access foreign embassies have to their dual citizens held there.\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals during the past two years, mostly on spying charges, according to lawyers, diplomats and relatives, Reuters reported in November.\nAccording to former prisoners, families of current ones and diplomats, in some cases the detainees are kept to be used for a prisoner exchange with Western countries. Iran denies the accusation.\nFILE PHOTO: Stones and placards with messages are placed on the pavement outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office during a demonstration to demand the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe who is imprisoned in Iran, in London, Britain, March 10, 2018.
