(Nasdaq:BL), today announced the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTherese Tucker, Founder and CEO, commented, “The first quarter was a good start to the year and we are pleased with our solid results. We continue to see strong demand globally and a large and growing market opportunity ahead of us as companies across all industries increasingly look to modernize, automate and transform their businesses. We remain focused on executing our top initiatives for the year to capitalize on our opportunities and build a strong foundation as BlackLine scales.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal GAAP revenues of $51.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 34% compared to the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss of $7.2 million, or $0.13 per share, on 53.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, on 56.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares with non-GAAP net loss of $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating cash flow of $1.8 million, compared with ($1.7) million in the first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow of ($1.5) million, compared with ($3.3) million in the first quarter of 2017.\nKey Metrics and Recent Business Highlights\nAdded 89 net new customers in the first quarter for a total of 2,297 customers at March 31, 2018. Expanded the company’s user base to a total of 202,098 BlackLine users at March 31, 2018. Achieved a dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 110% at March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Outlook\nSecond Quarter 2018\nTotal GAAP revenue is expected to be in the range of $53 million to $54 million. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $1.1 million to $0.1 million, or $0.02 to $0.00 per share on 53.7 million weighted average shares outstanding.\nFull Year 2018\nTotal GAAP revenue is expected to be in the range of $222 million to $225 million. Non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $0.5 million to $1.5 million, or $0.01 to $0.03 per share, on 57.0 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nBlackLine adopted the new revenue standard, ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018 and its guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018 is according to the new standard. The company adopted the new revenue standard on a full retrospective basis such that prior periods presented are comparable. Guidance for non-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share does not include the impact of the benefit from income taxes that we were able to recognize as a result of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets established upon the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016 of Runbook B.V. (the “Runbook Acquisition”), amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the company by its principal stockholders in 2013 (the “2013 Acquisition”) and the Runbook Acquisition, stock-based compensation, the change in fair value of contingent consideration, costs incurred in connection with our secondary offering, and costs incurred with our shelf offering. Reconciliations of non-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, or net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, are not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the unpredictability and complexity of the charges excluded from non-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The company expects the variability of the above changes could have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on its future GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nBlackLine, Inc. will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time on Thursday, May 3, 2018.

However, it is important to note that the particular items BlackLine excludes from, or includes in, its non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies in the same industry. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to such GAAP measures has been provided in the tables included as part of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin . Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as non-GAAP revenues less GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting resulting from the Runbook Acquisition, the amortization of acquired developed technology resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by non-GAAP revenues. BlackLine believes that presenting non-GAAP gross margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison of gross margin between periods.\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses . Non-GAAP operating expenses include (a) non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, (b) non-GAAP research and development expense and (c) non-GAAP general and administrative expense. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense is defined as GAAP sales and marketing expense adjusted for the amortization of acquired intangibles resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP research and development expense is defined as GAAP research and development expense adjusted for stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP general and administrative expense is defined as GAAP general and administrative expense as adjusted for the amortization of acquired intangibles resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and Runbook Acquisition, stock-based compensation, the change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition costs related to the Runbook Acquisition, costs incurred in connection with our secondary offering, and costs incurred in connection with our shelf offering. BlackLine believes that presenting each of the non-GAAP operating expenses is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain cash and non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison of operating expenses between periods.\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations . Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is defined as GAAP income (loss) from operations adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting to revenues resulting from the Runbook Acquisition, the amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, stock-based compensation, the change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition costs related to the Runbook Acquisition, costs incurred in connection with our secondary offering, and costs incurred in connection with our shelf offering. The company believes that presenting non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, purchase accounting and other related costs in order to allow a direct comparison of loss from operations between all periods presented.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) . Non-GAAP net income (loss) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of the benefit from income taxes that we were able to recognize as a result of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets established upon the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, the impact of purchase accounting to revenues resulting from the Runbook Acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, stock-based compensation, accretion of debt discount pertaining to the former debt facility, accretion of warrant discount relating to warrants issued in connection with the former debt facility, the change in the fair value of contingent consideration, the change in fair value of the common stock warrant liability, acquisition costs related to the Runbook Acquisition, costs incurred in connection with our secondary offering, and costs incurred in connection with our shelf offering. Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per common share includes the adjustment for shares resulting from the elimination of stock-based compensation. The company believes that presenting non-GAAP net income (loss) is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, purchase accounting and other related costs in order to allow a direct comparison of net loss between all periods presented.\nFree Cash Flow . Free cash flow is defined as cash flows used in operating activities less cash flows used in investing activities related to purchase of property and equipment and capitalized software development. BlackLine believes that presenting free cash flow is useful to investors as it provides a measure of the company’s liquidity used by management to evaluate the amount of cash generated by the company’s business including the impact of purchases of property and equipment and cost of capitalized software development.\nUse of Operating Metrics\nBlackLine has provided in this release and the quarterly conference call held on May 3, 2018 certain operating metrics, including (i) number of customers, (ii) number of users and (iii) dollar-based net revenue retention rate, which BlackLine uses to evaluate its business, measure its performance, identify trends affecting its business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. These operating metrics exclude the impact of Runbook licensed customers and users as these customers did not have an active subscription agreement with BlackLine as of March 31, 2018.\nDollar-based Net Revenue Retention Rate . Dollar-based net revenue retention rate is calculated as the implied monthly subscription and support revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which the company generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription and support revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. This calculation does not reflect implied monthly subscription and support revenue for new customers added during the one-year period but does include the effect of customers who terminated during the period. Implied monthly subscription and support revenue is defined as the total amount of minimum subscription and support revenue contractually committed to, under each of BlackLine’s customer agreements over the entire term of the agreement, divided by the number of months in the term of the agreement. BlackLine believes that dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and the company’s ability to retain and grow its relationships with existing customers over time.\nNumber of Customers . A customer is defined as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. BlackLine believes that its ability to expand its customer base is an indicator of the company’s market penetration and the growth of its business.\nNumber of Users . Since BlackLine’s customers generally pay fees based on the number of users of its platform within their organization, the company believes the total number of users is an indicator of the growth of its business.\nMedia Contact:\nBlackLine\nKimberly Uberti\nKimberly.uberti@blackline.com\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nThe Blueshirt Group\nMaria Riley\n415.217.7722\nmaria@blueshirtgroup.com\nBlackLine, Inc.
