But Constancio argued that enforcement of fiscal discipline was not at the top of his list of reforms, with a central fiscal stability function and the launch of a European safe asset all taking priority.\n“What is necessary is a stabilisation fund in periods of significant shocks, in the form of a ‘rainy-day’ fund that would provide transfers to be used in public spending with high multipliers for maximum effect, like investment or income support to the unemployed,” he said.\nFiscal stabilisation could kick in as unemployment rises and should provide incentives for structural reforms, Constancio argued.\nCompleting the banking union and creating a genuine capital markets union are also among the priorities while an improved fiscal rule to discipline countries is also needed, Constancio said.
