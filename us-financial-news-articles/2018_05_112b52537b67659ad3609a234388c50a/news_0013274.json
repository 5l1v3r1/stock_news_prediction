At one point, from the second through the sixth innings, he recorded 12 consecutive outs by strikeouts.\nThe last whiff in that run came with runners on first and second and no outs in the sixth. Scherzer then got Maikel Franco to ground an inning-ending double play that kept the Nationals in front 1-0.\nHowever, Scherzer ran into trouble in the seventh. Pedro Florimon led off with a single and stole second before Scherzer struck out Jorge Alfaro. Sammy Solis then came on to pitch.\nNick Williams tied the game with a bloop single to center. Brandon Kintzler replaced Solis, and Rhys Hoskins (double) and Odubel Herrera (single) delivered back-to-back RBI hits later in the inning that gave Philadelphia a 3-1 lead.\nFranco made it 4-1 with a solo homer in the eighth off Carlos Torres.\nThe Nationals’ Anthony Rendon lined a two-run single in the bottom of the eighth, cutting the deficit to 4-3. Washington then rallied for two in the ninth against Hector Neris (1-2).\nThe Nationals loaded the bases with no outs, and Neris walked pinch hitter Pedro Severino to force in the tying run. With five Phillies playing in the infield, Difo lined a game-winning single to center.\nSean Doolittle (1-1) earned the win after pitching one scoreless inning.\nScherzer wound up charged with one run on five hits and two walks.\nPhillies starter Jake Arrieta also got a tough-luck no-decision. He allowed one run on just two hits in six innings.\nThe only run Arrieta allowed came on a Matt Adams homer that gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead in the second. Adams has homered in four of his last six games.\nWashington’s Ryan Zimmerman did not start for a second straight game. Zimmerman and manager Dave Martinez said it was “stiffness” and “soreness.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:52:40.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
