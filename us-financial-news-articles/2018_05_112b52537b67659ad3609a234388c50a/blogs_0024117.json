The U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services reached $566 billion in 2017, a 12 percent increase on the previous year and the highest level since 2008.\n\"I think war is always no good, let's always try to avoid any wars,\" Yong said.\nFounded in 2000, Inventis Investment Holdings has about $10 billion in assets under management.
