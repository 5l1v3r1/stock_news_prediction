By 0802 GMT they were down 5.3 percent at 37.93 euros in a weaker banking sector.\n“Personnel expenses were ... up. With unemployment rates in most of our core markets low, further upward pressure is to be expected,” Chief Executive Andreas Treichl said. “The costs of IT-related projects — many of them driven by regulatory requirements — remained substantial.”\nThose expenses were the flip-side of robust economic growth in Austria and eastern Europe, where Erste operates. That had a positive effect on loan demand and loan quality, which enabled it to reduce its risk provisioning.\n“Demand for loans continues to be strong, particularly in the Czech Republic and Slovakia,” Treichl said. “By far the biggest contribution came, however, from an exceptionally benign risk environment, which resulted in net releases.”\nThe impairment result from financial instruments, normally a negative figure, turned positive, reaching 54.4 million euros in the quarter, compared with a write-down of 65.8 million euros a year earlier.\nDespite the rising costs and a lower core capital ratio, Erste said it was “excellently positioned” to meet its targets for 2018 of a higher dividend and a return on tangible equity (ROTE) above 10 percent. ROTE rose to 11.8 percent from 10.3 percent in the previous quarter.\n“Overall, all the conditions needed for a continuing positive development are in place,” Treichl said, citing a non-performing loans ratio of 3.7 percent and solid economic growth forecasts for countries Erste operates in.
