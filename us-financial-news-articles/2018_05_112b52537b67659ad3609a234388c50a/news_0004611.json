Thirdly, gold must be involved when electroplating. So within these rules, we are very careful to meet FIFA’s demands on Cup design each time we send our cup designs for to FIFA for review.”\nTaiwan-based Wagon had FIFA certification for their products for the last two World Cups in 2010 and 2014 but were restricted to East Asia and North America.\nThis year the company can sell to all markets outside Europe but still expects a quarter of the replicas to find a home in China, where they will range in price from little more than a dollar to 5,680 yuan ($895) for the biggest models.\nAlthough many of the replicas will be sold online, they will also be available at retail stores like the “Fans Shop” of Chinese Super League (CSL) club Beijing Guoan in the heart of the capital.\nShop manager Su Meng said he expected sales of official FIFA World Cup merchandise, including mascots and the Wagon-made replicas, to be up around 20 percent on 2014, thanks in part to the growing popularity of the CSL.\nOne 37-year-old Guoan fan, however, was sceptical about the value of replicas and said he would not consider purchasing such a souvenir of the tournament.\n“Only the real World Cup trophy has genuine value,” banker Sun Wei told Reuters.\n“This kind of imitation product, I think, isn’t worth spending money on.”\nWang Boqian, though, was far more enthusiastic about the copies of the 36.8-centimetre tall, 18-carat gold trophy which has represented the highest ambition for professional footballers since it replaced the Jules Rimet Trophy in 1974.\n“I think it’s the most beautiful trophy in the world,” Wang said.\n“I’ve always really liked this gold trophy. Every World Cup year, ever since 1998, for each one I’ve bought a (replica) gold trophy.” Writing by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T07:59:41.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
