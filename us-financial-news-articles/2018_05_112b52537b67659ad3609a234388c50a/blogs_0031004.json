Meanwhile, Netflix has a relationship with the show’s production company, Universal Television, which also works on The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . And TBS’ president, Kevin Reilly, helped develop Nine-Nine when he was an executive at Fox.\nEach network will be aware of the backlash against Fox since Thursday’s announcement of the show’s cancellation. That backlash was equally met with an outpour of support on social media for Brooklyn Nine-Nine ‘s crew and cast, led by Saturday Night Live alum Andy Samberg.
