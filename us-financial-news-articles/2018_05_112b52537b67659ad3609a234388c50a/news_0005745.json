Game 3 will be played in Boston on Wednesday.\nTampa Bay goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 18 shots.\nCharlie McAvoy and Torey Krug scored one goal apiece and Brad Marchand had two assists for the Bruins.\nBoston goaltender Tuukka Rask made 27 saves in the loss.\nWith Tampa Bay up 2-1, David Pastrnak was whistled for a double minor for high sticking in the third period, giving the Lightning a four-minute power play. The Bruins killed off the double minor and still trailed by a goal with 8:30 remaining in the game.\nThe Lightning surged ahead 3-1 when Palat scored at 14:08. Point registered his third assist on the huge goal, which helped to secure the victory.\nKrug got the Bruins within one goal at 15:58 — his third tally of the playoffs.\nTampa Bay went ahead 2-1 when Johnson flipped the puck over Rask’s shoulder and into the back of the net at 10:14 of the second.\nThe Bruins received a power play when Tampa Bay’s Victor Hedman was called for holding, but they couldn’t capitalize for the third time on the man advantage.\nThe Lightning dominated most of the first, outshooting Boston 9-0 to open the game. On an early power play, Steven Stamkos skated in and fired a shot from a tough angle that was saved by Rask.\nTampa Bay kept up the offensive pressure on another power play and struck first for a 1-0 lead when Gourde scored at 11:47 on the team’s 10th shot.\nThe Bruins finally responded and were awarded a two-man advantage for 1:45 after penalties to Johnson and Ryan McDonagh late in the first period. Pastrnak immediately clanged a wrist shot off the post. Bruins center David Krejci then ripped a slap shot and saw the laser ricochet off both posts and out of the crease.\nMcAvoy then tied the game at 1 for Boston at 18:30 of the opening period, shortly after the power play ended.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:29:03.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
