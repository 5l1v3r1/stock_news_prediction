As I join a strong executive team, my focus will remain on putting a corporate infrastructure in place and setting up our franchisees for success.\"\nNamaste Nail Sanctuary, the brainchild of serial entrepreneur Michael Elliot and his wife Mecca, was created to fill a void in the health and wellness space. After recognizing the societal burnout women face in their fast-paced professional and personal lives, the husband and wife duo experienced a light bulb moment as they realized they could provide women with dual-purposed concept where they are able to receive a manicure and pedicure while simultaneously meditate and relax. As a result, the first Namaste Nail Sanctuary location opened in April 2018 to create an ultra-Zen environment specially created for relaxation, meditation and nail care.\nAs the founder and Chairman of Hammer & Nails Grooming Shop for Guys, Michael is no stranger to the industry and is sure to flourish alongside Mecca, a certified meditation instructor and a self-healing coach who studied under the renowned Deepak Chopra.\n\"Kathleen brings an incredible amount of industry knowledge and experience to our executive team,\" said Michael Elliot. \"We are confident she will help the Namaste Nail Sanctuary brand continue to flourish and grow as she leads franchise operations and assists our franchise partners in achieving success. Our brand is only as strong as the people behind it and Kathleen is a great addition to help guide ongoing development.\"\nWith the first flagship location open in Studio City on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles County, brand expansion will continue with the development of more than 600 locations across 25 states as part of the 10 Area Representative multi-unit agreements already awarded. The strong franchise development efforts are part of the company's overarching goal to have 100 locations open and operating by 2021.\nNamaste Nail Sanctuary's focus on relaxation and meditation sets it apart from conventional nail salons and positions the brand as the first-and-only nail services franchise in the health and wellness category. Through walk-ins and optional membership plans ranging from $50-$120 a month, Namaste Nail Sanctuary guests can receive their routine mani-pedi while doing something that improves their health and their lives: relaxing.
