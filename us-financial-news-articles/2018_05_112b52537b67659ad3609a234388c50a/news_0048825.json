When bitcoin was trading at around $8,000 on Tuesday, Lee appeared on CNBC's \"Futures Now \" saying the digital currency was actually \"trading at cost\" because the price of production was actually about that amount. Despite the plunge, Lee also wrote to CNBC that the cost of production for bitcoin on Wednesday was at around $6,000, meaning that in Lee's eyes, bitcoin is still actually worth more than its cost of production.\nBut among the big catalysts that will boost the crypto space, Lee is keeping an eye on institutional investors.\n\"I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven't really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,\" he said on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.\"\nAnd finally, data compiled by Fundstrat show a historical trend that has Lee encouraging investors to hold onto bitcoin.\n\"Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of bitcoin's price,\" he said. \"If you just took out those 10 days, bitcoin's down 25 percent a year.\"\n\"So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days,\" he added.\nWith Wednesday's drop, bitcoin is now down 41 percent this year.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
