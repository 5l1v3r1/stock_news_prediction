It was forced to seek waivers from its lenders three times to avoid breaching its debt covenants.\nThe company is targeting a reduction in the leverage of 2 times or less net debt to core earnings or EBITDA by the end of 2020.\n“The possibility of a rights issue has long been rumoured but we had assumed that Petra would have sufficient liquidity post the renegotiation of their debt covenants on our estimates,” Liberum analyst Ben Davis said.
