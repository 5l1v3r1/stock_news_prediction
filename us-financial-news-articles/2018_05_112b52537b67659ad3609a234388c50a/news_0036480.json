Dallas (13.8 percent for top pick, 42.5 percent top three), the Atlanta Hawks (13.7 percent/42.4 percent), Orlando Magic (8.8 percent/29.1 percent), Chicago Bulls (5.3 percent/18.3 percent) have the next best chances for fortunes-shifting outcomes on Tuesday.\n—Mike Budenholzer is the top candidate to become head coach of two NBA franchises, ESPN reported on Monday.\nBudenholzer and the Toronto Raptors engaged in contract talks over the weekend, and the Milwaukee Bucks plan to revisit discussions about their job opening this week, per the report.
