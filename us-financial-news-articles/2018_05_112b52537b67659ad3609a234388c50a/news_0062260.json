REUTERS/Eric Vidal/File Photo U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs of 25 percent on incoming steel and 10 percent on aluminum, but granted the European Union a temporary exemption, which expires on Friday.\nThe Commission said Malmstrom and Ross had met to discuss the impending exemption expiry.\n“We will not speculate on what the final decision from the U.S. side will be. It is now up to the President of the United States to take that decision,” a Commission spokesman said.\nMalmstrom told the European Parliament on Tuesday that she hoped to secure a permanent exemption, with no tariffs or quotas, but that this was probably an unrealistic hope.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
