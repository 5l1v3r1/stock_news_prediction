(the “Company” or “RavenQuest”) – (CSE:RQB) (OTCQB:RVVQF) (Frankfurt:1IT) provides a corporate update.\nOperational Activity\nRavenQuest’s Investment Division has added two new projects at the MOU stage, including a 250,000 square foot joint venture with Fort McMurray #468 First Nation and the acquisition of late stage applicant, Western AgriPharma Limited, with 125,000 square feet of future grow space. Full buildout of both facilities moves RavenQuest’s projected production from 11,000 kg annually to over 50,000 kg annually.\nRavenQuest has signed a lease for space in downtown Edmonton aimed at opening its flagship retail recreational cannabis store, with application for license to be submitted near term. The retail space is strategically situated within close proximity to Edmonton’s downtown nightlife, concert halls, conference center, public transit and the popular “ICE District”, home to NHL hockey and a densely populated residential area. RavenQuest has designed a unique retail experience which includes significant space dedicated to education and awareness surrounding cannabis consumption.\nRavenQuest’s Greater Toronto facility, Bloomera, currently has a license to cultivate and has completed the first of two harvests required by Health Canada for license to sell and dispense. Bloomera successfully passed all chemistry and microbiology testing on the first grow cycle, expects to complete the second and acquire sell/dispense license by July, 2018.\nConstruction on Edmonton based Alberta Green Biotech (“AGB”) is fully funded and continues apace, precisely on schedule and on track for license to cultivate by July of 2018.\nBill Robinson, who leads Government and Indigenous Relations and Executive Director of the Indigenous Peoples’ Cannabis Association, hosted the first national conference call for the IPCA. IPCA membership continues to grow rapidly, indicating the level of interest from Indigenous communities in taking steps toward participating in the cannabis economy.\nNotably, RavenQuest’s service division produced $611,000 in revenue in the most recent quarter, covering all operational expenses for the company.\nTogether with its research partner, McGill University, the Company has received a $480,000 grant from the Natural Sciences & Engineering Research Council (NSERC), which, combined with RavenQuest cash and in-kind contributions, will total $1.2 million over three years toward scientific research aimed at recognition, stabilization and yield maximization of the cannabis plant. RavenQuest sees this work as essential toward delivering a repeatable, reliable and consistent product to its end consumers and patients, all key elements to global success as a cannabis company.\nIn its commitment to ongoing human excellence, RavenQuest wishes to share the addition of two key members of its growing team.\nAndy Schinke will lead RavenQuest’s efforts in Cannabis Sales and Product Acquisition. Mr. Schinke has held VP Sales & Marketing roles within various industries.
