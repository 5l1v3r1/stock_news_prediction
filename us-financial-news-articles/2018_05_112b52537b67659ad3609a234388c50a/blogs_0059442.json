For instance, Greenfeld said clients raising cash to buy a home or to pay for a vacation tend to keep aggressive investments that have performed well recently, while selling conservative investments that have lagged behind the riskier assets.

However, it's also true that clients with larger portfolios at a single advisor may be able to negotiate lower percentages and discounts on other fees.\nAnd even advisors concede that sometimes having more than one financial planner is acceptable. For instance, advisors may support an investor keeping some funds with a legacy advisor who is a long-time family advisor or friend.\nAnd it's important to understand the difference between an advisor, who crafts and implements overall strategy including long-term asset allocation, and an investment manager who deals in specific investments. An investor with a single advisor may still have multiple managers employing different strategies, such as equities and fixed income. Single-advisor solutions\nInstead of having multiple advisors, investors can better address worries about overreliance on a single advisor by using one that, unlike Madoff, employs a third-party custodian to hold investments in the investor's name and issue account statements, according to Waldron's Greenfeld. \"If something would, God forbid, happen to your advisor's firm, you can take your assets to another firm,\" he said. \"Those are held in your name, not in a commingled bucket.\"\nTransferring all funds to a single advisor's care may still involve complications and risk. For instance, if consolidated assets include investments that a particular advisor doesn't normally deal with, it's important to consider tax and other concerns before simply selling those and replacing them with something the advisor is more comfortable with. \"At the end of the day, even if you have more than one advisor, you have to have somebody who's the alpha advisor. You have to have somebody who understands the whole picture.\" -Ben Greenfeld, certified financial planner with Waldron Private Wealth\nFor that reason, it may be best to take time to gradually transfer assets to a single advisor. Investors may also want to avoid burning bridges by suddenly leaving an advisor. However, Sipes at Exencial said most advisors will understand the desire to consolidate. \"I am a huge fan of it,\" she said. \"In fact, it might even give some relief to both the client and the advisors when a client decides to consolidate.\"\nAnd it may be fine to have multiple advisors if these risks and limitations are kept in mind and addressed by having someone to oversee it all. \"At the end of the day, even if you have more than one advisor, you have to have somebody who's the alpha advisor,\" said Greenfeld at Waldron Private Wealth. \"You have to have somebody who understands the whole picture.\" Mark Henricks Special to CNBC.com Investor Toolkit ", "external_links": ["http://exencialwealth.com/", "https://nbcuni.com/privacy/", "http://www.waldronprivatewealth.com/", "http://www.aicpa.org/"], "published": "2018-05-30T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T16:04:55.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
