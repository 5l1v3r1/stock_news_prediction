James Cockerille is promoted to Chief Strategy Officer; Lindsay Williams is promoted to Chief Connections Officer; Alex Lea joins Rokkan as SVP, Executive Creative Director for Cadillac; and Tammy Hwang joins as SVP, Strategy to lead strategy across various accounts, primarily Verizon.\n\"Rokkan's unique approach to business doesn't end with the creative work we deliver our client, but it's embodied in the unconventional decisions we make as we build a diverse and exceptional team,\" said John Noe, CEO, Rokkan. \"I'm delighted to elevate James to the role of Chief Strategy Officer. We were drawn to his expertise as a global brand strategist and steward, and his ability to bring a broader, less conventional perspective to the role; we want someone who can navigate the new world of advertising and provide leadership on how to creatively break down traditional models and architect new ways to serve brands,\" said Noe.\n\"Lindsay's role as Chief Connections Officer will be focused on deepening our ability to drive transformation and growth for clients with a growing focus on data and consumer engagement. The Connections group will also serve as a deeper connection point to more of the tools and resources the Publicis Groupe brings. James and Lindsay have been a perfect fit in helping to move Rokkan into the future, and we look forward to the brave, breakthrough work to come as we welcome Alex Lea and Tammy Hwang to the fold.\"\nJames Cockerille, Chief Strategy Officer\nJames Cockerille joined Rokkan in September 2017 as SVP, Strategic Integration to work across brands, with a specific focus on Cadillac. He immediately exceeded expectations, taking on strategic leadership during a time of rapid expansion and growth at Rokkan. His ability to look beyond traditional solutions and provide future-thinking counsel has been vital to Rokkan's continued success and the swift decision to name him CSO was organic.\nCockerille brings with him more than two decades of unique global branding expertise that spans market research and insight development to brand positioning and implementation. His career includes leadership roles at Interbrand and FutureBrand in Australia. His work on Cadillac during his time as global strategic lead at FutureBrand cemented his status as a dynamic, creative leader.

Williams' brand-side experience and strategic background helps her in solving complex business challenges through a mix of data and creativity.\nWilliams promotion to Chief Connections officer demonstrates Rokkan's deep integration within Publicis Groupe, and will help each leverage human insights captured through data and analytics to create more impactful work. Williams will be a key player in bringing siloed departments and work streams together to engage with new partners in a way that positions them for growth and delivers tangible business results.\nPrior to Rokkan, Williams was global digital marketing director at Estee Lauder and worked in media at Aviatech and Razorfish where she served global brands like Mrs. Fields, Best Buy, Nike, Walmart and Mercedes-Benz.\nAlex Lea, SVP, Executive Creative Director for Cadillac\nAlex Lea brings with him diverse career experience to offer fresh and creative ideas on the newly won Cadillac business. He comes to Rokkan from Saatchi & Saatchi's New York office, where he worked on Walmart as part of Publicis' dedicated unit DeptW. Previously, Lea led creative for Ally Bank as group creative director at Grey New York, and before that was executive creative director for Erwin Penland's New York office working with L.L. Bean. Additional client experience includes Miller High Life, Keystone Light, General Mills' Fruitsnacks, Kraft's Capri Sun, Kool Aid, Microsoft XBOX, Kraft JELL-O, and more at high-profile agencies including Droga5 and CP+B, among others.\nTammy Hwang, SVP, Strategy for Verizon\nTammy Hwang will lead strategy for various Rokkan accounts with a specific focus on Verizon.

Hwang has also held executive strategy positions at Fitzgerald & Co. and McCann New York.\nIn 2017, Rokkan broke the mold by achieving unprecedented growth during a time when the industry as a whole was struggling.
