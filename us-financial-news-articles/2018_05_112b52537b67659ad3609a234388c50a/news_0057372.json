It’s sometimes as simple as that,” Samoura told the BBC.\n“It is something we are fighting on a daily basis on the pitch - I don’t want any racist person around me.\n“Nobody asks a man when he takes a position if he’s competent to do the job. They just assume that he can do the job.\n“For a woman to make her way up to the top - you need to prove every single day that you are the best fit for that position.” Writing by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T08:59:15.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
