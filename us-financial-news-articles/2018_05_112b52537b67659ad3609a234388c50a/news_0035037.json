The company also announced the appointment of seasoned industry veteran Verl Allen as CEO. Allen previously worked in corporate development and strategy roles at Adobe and Omniture , overseeing over $2 billion in acquisitions during his time there.\n“Having evaluated hundreds of technology vendors in the enterprise marketing space, I’ve seen first hand just how difficult it is to get consistent and reliable data when making important decisions about campaign spend and attribution,” said Allen. “When I saw the Tracking First solution, I recognized how critical its service would be to enterprises everywhere. I’m looking forward to accelerating the company’s strong growth and helping marketers and data analysts gain deeper insights into campaign performance across the enterprise.”\nTracking First was co-founded by Craig Scribner and John Boyd in 2012 when they realized that enterprise marketing and analytics teams were struggling to make sense of campaign data being generated across an increasingly fragmented ecosystem of marketing agencies and software solutions. This fragmentation has led to dirty and siloed campaign data being delivered to analytics and business intelligence solutions, which results in inaccurate campaign attribution results and therefore incorrect marketing spend decisions.\n“Faulty data inevitably leads to flawed analysis, and nowhere is the problem more pronounced than within digital marketing campaigns,” said Craig Scribner, co-founder of Tracking First. “We started Tracking First to restore faith in digital analytics and enable our clients to transition their marketing safely and securely to a data-driven paradigm.”\nTracking First standardizes and structures campaign data coming from all marketing channels so that teams across the enterprise can make faster and more accurate decisions. The result is higher returns on investment in analytics, business intelligence and marketing spend by enabling the enterprise to operate using clean source data.\nWith more than 30 enterprise clients, Tracking First has already seen a strong market fit and significant traction. This funding will allow the company to continue expanding its sales, marketing and product teams so it is well-positioned to capture growing market demand.\nTo learn more about Tracking First visit www.trackingfirst.com .\nAbout Tracking First\nTracking First helps digital marketers analyze and run campaigns more efficiently by unifying the data from multiple campaigns across disparate systems into one single integrated view.
