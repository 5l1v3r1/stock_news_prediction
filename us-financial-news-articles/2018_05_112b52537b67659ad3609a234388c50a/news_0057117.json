We will make some announcements along these lines soon,” the spokesman said, confirming earlier media reports.\nCarrefour has been official sponsor of the French Football Federation since 1998 and of the Tour de France since 1993.\nThe contracts, which come up for renewal every four year, will not be renewed from 2019, the spokesman said.\nThis will thus not impact the World Soccer Cup in Russia in June 2018 nor the Tour de France that starts in early July.\nUnder pressure to increase profits, Europe’s largest retailer announced in January cost savings of 2 billion euros (1.7 billion pounds) by 2020, including a voluntary redundancy plan for 2,400 employees at its French head office.
