This study is being conducted on alternative diagnostic testing platforms using newly discovered biomarkers and seeks to confirm previous results,” said William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are on track to meet our mid-year timeline for the results of this study. If the remaining DetermaVu™ studies are successful, our goal remains to complete the final Clinical Validation study in 2018.”\nAs recently reported, OncoCyte discovered and filed patent applications for an additional 190 novel lung cancer biomarkers that may enable DetermaVu™ to provide better differentiation between malignant and benign lung nodules for improved lung cancer diagnosis. Our current study is analyzing a combination of the biomarkers OncoCyte used in earlier studies and newly discovered biomarkers. All 160 study samples have now been run on two established commercial diagnostic testing platforms and the data are being analyzed.\nThe outcome of the study will determine whether the 190 novel biomarkers will further increase the accuracy of DetermaVu™ and whether the diagnostic testing platforms being tested will provide consistent and robust support for the further clinical development studies that are necessary for commercialization.\nTimeline and Upcoming Milestones\nData analysis from all 160 samples is expected to be completed by mid-year, at which time a decision will be made as to the diagnostic testing platform the Company will use going forward. Once the appropriate platform is selected, OncoCyte will work to optimize and lock a new algorithm based on the diagnostic testing platform and the new panel of biomarkers selected for the test, and then conduct an R&D Validation Study which will include an Analytic Validation Study. All samples necessary for carrying out these studies are in-house, enabling rapid advancement through each study. If these studies are successful, the Company will conduct a Clinical Validation study, which it expects to complete in 2018.\nOther Recent Developments\nBolstered the balance sheet through a $10 million private placement of common stock with two current investors.\nDiscovered and filed patent applications for 190 novel lung cancer biomarkers that may enhance OncoCyte’s lung cancer test and enable better differentiation of malignant from benign lung nodules for improved lung cancer diagnosis.\nEnhanced abilities to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and develop lung cancer diagnostic products through the continued growth of our well-characterized lung cancer clinical sample bank.\nStrengthened the Board of Directors by adding Ronald Andrews, Jr., an executive with over 30 years’ experience in the molecular diagnostics and genomics industries. In addition, Cavan Redmond, a Director since 2015, was appointed Chairman of the Board.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, OncoCyte incurred a net loss of $3.8 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to a net loss of $4.7 million, or $0.16 per share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $3.9 million, and were $3.4 million on an as adjusted basis.\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $1.5 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $0.3 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1.8 million compared to $2.0 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $0.2 million. This decrease is mainly attributable to a $1.1 million shareholder noncash expense for the issuance of certain warrants during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by increases in legal, compliance and business development costs, and compensation related expenses, including noncash stock-based compensation expense primarily related to stock options granted to an executive hired in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, OncoCyte had cash and cash equivalents of $12.6 million and marketable securities valued at $0.95 million. An additional $2 million was received on May 10, 2018 as the final installment of a stock purchase commitment in a private placement of common stock during March 2018. The Company believes its resources, coupled with prudent expense management, are sufficient to execute its near-term strategies.\nCash used in operations was approximately $2.75 million for the first quarter of 2018, as reported, or just over $900,000 per month, which represents a reduced annualized cash used in operations compared to 2017.\nConference Call\nOncoCyte will host a conference call today, May 15, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT to discuss financial results.\nThe dial-in number in the U.S./Canada is 800-263-0877; for international participants, the number is +1-323-794-2094.

Early detection of cancer can improve health outcomes, reduce the cost of care, and improve patients’ quality of life. Liquid biopsy diagnostic tests like those OncoCyte is developing may reduce the need for costlier and riskier diagnostic procedures such as invasive biopsy and cystoscopic procedures. OncoCyte’s development pipeline is focused on non-invasive confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung, breast, and bladder cancer. OncoCyte’s tests are being developed using proprietary sets of genetic and protein molecular markers that differentially express in specific types of cancer. OncoCyte conducts ongoing research to identify additional molecular markers, acquire or license markers and related technology, and develop tests based on those markers.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements that are not historical fact (including, but not limited to statements that contain words such as “will,” “believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “estimates” and similar expressions) are forward-looking statements.

In particular, OncoCyte has provided non-GAAP total operating expenses, adjusted to exclude noncash stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, OncoCyte believes the presentation of non-GAAP total operating expenses, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP total operating expenses, is helpful in understanding OncoCyte’s ongoing operating expenses and its programs.\nFurthermore, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in the aggregate to establish budgets and operational goals, to manage OncoCyte’s business and to evaluate its performance and its programs.\nOncoCyte Corporation\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted Operating Expenses Amounts In Thousands For the Three Months\nEnded March 31, 2018\n(unaudited) GAAP Operating Expenses - as reported $ 3,906 Stock-based compensation expense (346 ) Depreciation and amortization expense (164 ) Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, as adjusted $ 3,396\nSource:OncoCyte Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MDrlWgfle9Ao0iiOf6HiXLkNfQbVsvt09M0_DC5fxRNHDRhPctC-kNocJOLd-T1-_c_v7ejJ70f258jNHcde5pb0HowjZbORjLLmIh1CK4DIz1WFR5GNp2MqyYu4iX5v5GxXOQASf-A7TDnnslwaaic_m9YVmT3HGQEZQ5G7jtrJ7NTE4_pM6ToLdjce9iVhqh-nklEWGagmLVaaspb-NH_iZeecgUxS6xZ8A2n-M46ETmH_Qr1PgN9iD5DV5lA9X61gY-FCBZW170jl0nnfHw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=05Qp2Ba-vh2vFVafHTMWUXgEvtVwbU3kdacMl2dDgG_aLNL1--z3N1Gk6U8SUqTM0RvUwuLpBzsagtg0D62PjGdUoSWiA_ydPoWdw63ehGI8C-G8tuWF5kefbK0TEWOIu9OTtBr8ncCWZqUnspfAY2rjebE9fmxg9eQJD7P6vO_4MgDiCc21JjZOjxjoA-Or", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=05Qp2Ba-vh2vFVafHTMWUXgEvtVwbU3kdacMl2dDgG_aLNL1--z3N1Gk6U8SUqTM0RvUwuLpBzsagtg0D62PjDHEo_2JSIJ_IErtGUFzKRzWI-FCmpehZdWcMR4PWSUEt-9bOYfUZD30iIZV678Xhbky3yqApXJrxnNIrpdbWrZArqGkNSMaFtiuEUCukXHr", "http://investors.oncocyte.com/events-and-presentations", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CIXfUFrfOtYdyt7E9-bQ32TfDWr0c1a4o1DKw9RcMuoR7bbXEQRoXOXN_VZ_RlV7TNBXzqci5NVuK2rRgi7Jy1w8TtmrEdMbI4LCDZiE8qesh9Igm9y7WVzwrR1dplzCMMUkkCPCWBJ6Z9Ed808q3RqWFBVM0hzm4RNx9uqaJZMxPwg9p6tIolsK5zzH3NPRWyAX7-iaq7Lva8_3DGIQ-quDsoSS5mndYIRM-zNQiW4=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wj9HgUGF6b7ZhdhsIffevdPrmiIsHHhzXIuWu-BuGJI0sP2gdWBTmJIpmm1mGhRsIoxh7uBVqzSGbLN4fZzoEhv4cpGXK9hWycmHimKTUCW6ghAM-l7bTdFonmsaTCwUTkVViZwQGl8_yiImPIOqZfWdZtE11ApXeVr2TMvqzmin_AADVTAPo5DkkdhI1mzCzlKU_ozuytIAkJw4fOA5bGPvkMXqtHvtGpoWT73BxWFrSzSEDXorqPAQsPpsCgCxgTeEWkmDIZDJ6rI28ZuhaQ=="], "published": "2018-05-16T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T02:54:22.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
