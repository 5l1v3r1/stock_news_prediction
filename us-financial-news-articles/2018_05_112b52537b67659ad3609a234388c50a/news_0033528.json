Few details of the climb were available.\nA Polish climber held the previous record of 126 days to complete the Seven Summits.\nApart from Everest, the six highest peaks are Denali (North America), Elbrus (Europe), Vinson (Antarctica), Aconcagua (South America), Kilimanjaro (Africa) and Papua New Guinea’s Carstensz Pyramid (Australasia/Oceania).\nMore than 340 foreigners, each paying $11,000 (8,110 pounds) for a climbing permit, and their sherpa guides, are at the Everest base camp or other high camps in Nepal.\nThe peak, first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953, can also be climbed from Tibet, where about 180 climbers are waiting to ascend.\nReporting by Gopal Sharma; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T10:14:35.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
