An eventual agreement, then, would have to involve state governors as well.\nMoreira Franco said there was no timeframe for a possible decision and implementation despite the ongoing talks.\nTruck owners are threatening a widespread strike if the government fails to act to reduce diesel costs.\nAbcam, a local truckers association, said truckers would go on strike on Monday if the government did not come up with a position on possible measures to reduce costs by the end of Friday.\nA large part of goods transportation in Brazil, including commodities such as sugar and grains, is by road.\nFuel costs have also impacted the agricultural sector in Brazil and worldwide. Farmers are about to start to harvest the country’s main corn crop and have complained about high operational costs.\nWriting by Marcelo Teixeira Editing by Bernadette Baum and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:33:19.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
