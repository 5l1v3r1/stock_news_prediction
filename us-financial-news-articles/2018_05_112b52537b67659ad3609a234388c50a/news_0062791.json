We will soon vote on the budget law and will understand what will happen,” another 5-Star source said.\nEarlier on Monday, League leader Matteo Salvini said his party was evaluating whether to continue the alliance with the 5-star in any new elections.\nReporting by Massmiliano Di Giorgio; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:24:37.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
