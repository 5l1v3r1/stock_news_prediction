Savona has espoused skepticism about the single currency project and the budget constraints it demands of members. He has also been highly critical of Germany, likening the dominant role Berlin plays in determining Europe’s economic policies to the military aggression of Nazi Germany.\nThe 5 Star Movement and the League refused to back away from their choice of Savona, creating the standoff. Italy’s president must approve a government’s ministerial picks.
