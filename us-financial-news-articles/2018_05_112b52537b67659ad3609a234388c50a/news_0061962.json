Keith Hovis, a spokesman for Minnesota Management and Budget, said general obligation and appropriation-backed bills were included in the bill and that plans for the state’s next bond sale have not been finalized.\nThe state’s GO bonds are rated AAA by Fitch Ratings, Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service and AA-plus by S&P Global Ratings.
