REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\nMany hotels and apartments are asking several thousand dollars for accommodation that normally costs around $50 per night or cancelling existing bookings to charge higher rates for the expected influx of around 50,000 supporters.\nTo promote a welcoming image of Ukraine, Ukrainians have taken to social media to offer supporters spare beds, lifts from the airport and even home-cooked meals of borscht, a traditional beetroot soup.\nEven President Petro Poroshenko has offered to host a few fans to make up for the lack of affordable accommodation in the capital over the weekend of the final between Liverpool and Spain’s Real Madrid.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\nOpposition MP Sobolev, his wife and three children have agreed to hand over the keys to their apartment in central Kiev to a Liverpool supporter and his young daughter.\n“I don’t think this is a risky idea. This is a pleasant and powerful way to connect people from different countries and continents,” he told Reuters in his apartment.

In 2014, they invited a family to stay for three months who had fled pro-Russian separatist fighting in eastern Ukraine.\nKiev’s outpouring of hospitality stems in part from a desire to show the country has recovered from the worst of a political and economic crisis sparked by a 2013/14 pro-European uprising and subsequent separatist conflict.\nA Facebook group called ‘Kyiv FREE couch’ that matches Ukrainians offering free accommodation with soccer supporters in need of a place to stay has gained over 5,000 members since its launch on May 5.\n“This group should be called ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’,” member Zibby Puculek said in a post, referring to the Liverpool club anthem. “You are very, very nice people.” Editing by Matthias Williams and Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:32:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
