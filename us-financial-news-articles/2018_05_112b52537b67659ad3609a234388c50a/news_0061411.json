China itself has cut solar costs by 90 percent in the last decade, offsetting the subsidy declines.\nLiang said a project built in Xinjiang in 2011 cost about 10-11 yuan per watt, while some industry estimates now say prices could fall to as low as 1.5 yuan by 2020.\nThe government is also offering alternative means of support, including a scheme compelling regions to ensure a fixed proportion of their power comes from renewables.\nRenesola, formerly a polysilicon wafer producer, last year transferred its manufacturing assets and debts to chairman Li Xianshou in exchange for additional equity, switching its business model to downstream generation projects in the process.
