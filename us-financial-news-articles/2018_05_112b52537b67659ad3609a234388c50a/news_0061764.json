It has made substantial progress in fortifying its manmade islands in the past few years, which it says it has the right to defend.\nLast week, the Philippines expressed “serious concern” over the presence of China’s strategic bombers in the disputed waters, but its response to the installation of missile systems was muted.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Martin Petty and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T09:56:17.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
