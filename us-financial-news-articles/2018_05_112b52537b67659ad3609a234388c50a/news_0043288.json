(NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018. Net sales for the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 increased 12% to $8.7 billion. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 3% over the comparable period last year ending May 6, 2017. Net income for the first quarter was $716 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.13. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $.96, a 17% increase over the prior year’s $.82.\nErnie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, “We are very pleased with our first quarter results as both our consolidated comp store sales growth of 3% and earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Marmaxx, our largest division, delivered a strong 4% comparable store sales increase as consumers were drawn to our great fashions and brands at outstanding values! Customer traffic was once again the primary driver of our comparable store sales increases at each of our four large divisions. Based on our strong first quarter performance, we are updating our outlook for full-year earnings per share. We believe that the consistency of our customer traffic increases demonstrates the strength and resiliency of our business and our ability to succeed through many types of economic and retail environments. Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a strong start and we see plentiful opportunities to capitalize on the exciting fashions and brands available to us in the marketplace. We are convinced that we will continue to gain market share and grow successfully around the world.”\nSales by Business Segment\nThe Company’s comparable store sales and net sales by division, in the first quarter, were as follows:\nFirst Quarter First Quarter Comparable Store Sales 1,2,3 Net Sales ($ in millions) 3,4 FY2019 FY2018 FY2019 FY2018 Marmaxx 5,6 +4% 0% $5,381 $4,967 HomeGoods 7 +2% +3% $1,269 $1,121 TJX Canada +3% +3% $854 $739 TJX International (Europe & Australia) +1% 0% $1,185 $957 TJX +3% +1% $8,689 $7,784 1 Comparable store sales outside the U.S. calculated on a constant currency basis, which removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. 2 Comparable store sales exclude Sierra Trading Post, tjmaxx.com , and tkmaxx.com . 3 Net sales in TJX Canada and TJX International include the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. See below. 4 Figures may not foot due to rounding. 5 Combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. 6 Net sales include Sierra Trading Post. 7 Net sales in FY2019 include Homesense stores in the U.S.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Company’s international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course, inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on the magnitude of these translations and adjustments when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates.\nThe movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a three percentage point positive impact on consolidated net sales growth in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.04 positive impact on first quarter Fiscal 2019 earnings per share, compared with a $.01 positive impact last year.\nA table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investors section of tjx.com .\nThe foreign currency exchange rate impact to earnings per share does not include the impact currency exchange rates have on various transactions, which the Company refers to as “transactional foreign exchange.”\nMargins\nFor the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company’s consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.0%, a 0.3 percentage point increase compared with the prior year’s 10.7%.\nGross profit margin for the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 was 28.9%, down 0.1 percentage point versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs as a percent of sales for the first quarter were 17.8%, down 0.3 percentage points versus the prior year’s ratio, primarily due to expense savings and a one-time gain related to a lease buyout.\nInventory\nTotal inventories as of May 5, 2018, were $4.4 billion, compared with $3.7 billion at the end of the first quarter last year. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis as of May 5, 2018, including the distribution centers, but excluding inventory in transit and the Company’s e-commerce businesses, were up 7% on a reported basis (up 6% on a constant currency basis, compared to a decrease of 7% on a constant currency basis in the prior year). The Company is in an excellent inventory position entering the second quarter and has plenty of liquidity to take advantage of the terrific opportunities it sees in the marketplace for quality, branded merchandise.\nShareholder Distributions\nDuring the first quarter, the Company returned a total of $597 million to shareholders. The Company repurchased a total of $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 4.9 million shares, and paid $197 million in shareholder dividends. The Company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $2.5 to $3.0 billion of TJX stock in Fiscal 2019. The Company may adjust this amount up or down depending on various factors. Additionally, the Company increased its dividend by 25% in the first quarter, marking the 22 nd consecutive year of dividend increases. The Company remains committed to returning cash to its shareholders while continuing to reinvest in the business to support the near- and long-term growth of TJX.\nSecond Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2019 Outlook\nFor the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04. Excluding an expected benefit of approximately $.15 per share due to items related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (primarily the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate), the Company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $.87 to $.89, compared to $.85 last year. This guidance assumes that restructuring costs within the Company’s IT department will negatively impact EPS growth by 3% to 4%. These costs were contemplated in TJX’s original full-year guidance provided in February 2018. The Company expects that wage increases will negatively impact EPS growth by another 2%. The Company also anticipates that foreign currency will benefit EPS growth by approximately 4%. This EPS outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 1% to 2%.\nFor the 52-week fiscal year ending February 2, 2019, the Company now expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.83, which represents an 18% to 20% increase over the prior year’s $4.04. The Company’s full-year guidance includes an expected benefit of approximately $.72 to $.73 per share due to items related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (primarily the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate), which is approximately $.02 lower than previous guidance of $.73 to $.75 per share.\nThe Company is increasing the high-end of its Fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance by $.02 to reflect its strong first quarter results. The Company now expects adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the benefit from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act mentioned above, to be in the range of $4.04 to $4.10. This guidance represents a 5% to 6% increase over the prior year’s adjusted $3.85, which excludes a $.17 net benefit due to items related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a benefit of approximately $.11 from the extra week in the Company’s Fiscal 2018 calendar, and a $.10 impairment charge related to Sierra Trading Post from GAAP EPS of $4.04. This guidance reflects an assumption that wage increases will negatively impact EPS growth by 2%. This EPS outlook continues to be based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 1% to 2%.\nIt is important to note that Fiscal 2019 full-year adjusted guidance assumes that $.07 of the $.09 EPS benefit from the above-plan first quarter will be offset by a combination of factors. The Company now expects a $.03 negative impact to EPS due to significantly higher planned freight costs than the Company originally expected, partially offset by assumptions for stronger operational performance. In addition, the Company now anticipates a reversal of the $.02 above-plan first quarter gain on inventory hedges, and an assumption that the benefit from translational foreign exchange will be $.02 lower than originally planned for the full year.\nThe Company’s earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year Fiscal 2019 assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the second quarter.\nStores by Concept\nDuring the first quarter ended May 5, 2018, the Company increased its store count by 71 stores to a total of 4,141 stores. The Company increased square footage by 5% over the same period last year.\nStore Locations 1 Gross Square Feet 2 First Quarter First Quarter (in millions) Beginning End Beginning End In the U.S.: T.J.
