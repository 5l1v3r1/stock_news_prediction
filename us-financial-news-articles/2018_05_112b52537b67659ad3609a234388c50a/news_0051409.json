The notes were sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”) and to certain non-United States persons in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\n“This discretionary funding is in complete alignment with our strategic priority to strengthen the balance sheet, as it reduces near-term pension funding risk using a fixed-rate, 10-year maturity instrument,” said Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer William Oplinger. “Further, because the debt increase is offset by a lower net pension liability, it is leverage neutral and does not impact our 2018 capital allocation strategy.”\nAs the Company has previously publicly stated, including in its May 2018 investor presentation , Alcoa’s 2018 capital allocation framework is to:\nMaintain liquidity with a cash balance greater than $1 billion; Spend approximately $300 million in sustaining capital expenditures; Drive value creation through approximately $150 million in return-seeking capital expenditures; Optimize liabilities by reducing debt and pension/other postretirement employee benefits liabilities by a combined approximately $300 million, plus additional reductions with 50 percent of excess cash above $1 billion cash balance; and Return cash to stockholders using the remaining 50 percent of excess cash above the $1 billion cash balance.\nIn April 2018, Alcoa optimized roughly one third of its targeted $300 million in liabilities when the Company purchased group annuity contracts and transferred approximately $555 million in obligations, and related assets, of defined benefit pension plans in Canada. As part of the annuity agreements, Alcoa contributed approximately $95 million to facilitate the annuity transaction and maintain the funding level of the remaining plan obligations.\nIn the remainder of 2018, Alcoa expects to achieve further liability optimization of approximately $200 million, either through discretionary contributions to its pension plans, reducing funded debt in Brazil, or both.\nAbout Alcoa\nAlcoa is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products, and is built on a foundation of strong values and operating excellence dating back nearly 130 years to the world-changing discovery that made aluminum an affordable and vital part of modern life.
