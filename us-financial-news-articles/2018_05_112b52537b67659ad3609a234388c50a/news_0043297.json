The benchmark fell 0.1 percent on Monday.\nJames McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut, said the market was being driven down by a broad-based sell-off.\n“The banks are all weak...the Royal Commission is still weighing heavily on the market’s perceptions. It’s not only the perception of what has happened, but also the perception of what’s going to happen,” McGlew said.\nThe country’s “Big Four” lenders all admitted on Monday to misconduct in their submissions at a third round of public hearings that focuses on loans to small businesses.\nWestpac Banking Corp admitted to signing a legally blind pensioner as guarantor without warning her of the risk losing her home, while Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said it was aware that 47 fraudulent business loans had been extended last year.\nThe news of the transgressions led to a sell-off in the sector, with the financial index falling as much as 0.9 percent to its lowest since April 30.\nWestpac fell as much as 0.7 percent, while ANZ dropped 1.6 percent.\nMaterials stocks, especially miners, were lower, weakened by an extended fall in iron ore prices. China’s Dalian iron ore futures fell more than 3 percent on Monday to their weakest in two weeks and were trading 2.1 percent lower by 0247 GMT.\nBHP, the world’s biggest miner, slipped 1.1 percent while rival Rio Tinto Ltd slid 0.9 percent.

The company posted a 17 percent rise in annual adjusted net operating profit, helped by higher unit prices and an uptick in house construction in the key U.S. market.\nIn New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 2.02 points to 8,613.70.\nConsumer staples led the fall, with the a2 Milk Company Ltd dipping 1.9 percent.\nCountering the losses on the benchmark was a jump in healthcare stocks, with Ryman Healthcare Ltd climbing 1.8 percent.
