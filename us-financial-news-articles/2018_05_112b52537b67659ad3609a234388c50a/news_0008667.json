REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\nThe Investec Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) improved to 55.3 from 54.1 in March. That was down from an all-time index high of 59.1 in December.\nThe index held above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the 59th month in a row, but growth in both new orders and new export orders fell to their slowest rates since 2016.\n“The moderation in client demand has had a knock-on effect on other components of the report,” including a cooling of growth in employment and backlogs of work, said Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O’Sullivan.\nBut the survey showed manufacturing managers remained positive, with around 95 percent of panelists saying they anticipate output to be the same or higher in 12 months’ time.\n“With global growth at a seven year high, we think that this optimism is well-placed,” O’Sullivan said.
