The MOS acquisition will position CEMATRIX for further growth in the United States and will provide both trained operation staff and additional equipment to meet the growing North American demand for cellular concrete. Each company has technologies that can make both companies stronger players in their respective markets and their combined sales will provide the growing working capital to support this expected growth. If CEMATRIX and MOS had been combined at the beginning of 2018 the combined contracted and verbally awarded projects would be in excess of $33.5 million, $5.2 million of which is scheduled for 2019. Since CEMATRIX will only be recording 7 months of the MOS sales in its 2018 results, this will amount to approximately $27.5 million in CEMATRIX consolidated sales for 2018 and a $5.2 million carryover to 2019.”\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Corporation’s unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, both of which can be found on SEDAR.\nCEMATRIX is an Alberta corporation with its head offices in Calgary, Alberta.
