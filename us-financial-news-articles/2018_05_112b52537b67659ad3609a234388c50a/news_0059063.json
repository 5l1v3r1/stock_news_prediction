Lawmakers finally enacted a fiscal 2018 budget and income tax rate hikes over Rauner’s vetoes last July.\nRevenue from the tax increase, which Rauner has vowed to roll back, is incorporated in the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The spending plan does not include controversial elements in Rauner’s proposed spending plan, which called for shifting some pension costs currently paid by the state onto local school districts, state universities and community colleges.\nThere was no immediate comment from the governor’s office.\nThe budget adds $350 million to a new K-12 school funding formula enacted last year, increases higher education spending by 2 percent, reduces cuts in state aid to local governments, and appropriates $1.3 billion to pay previously incurred expenses.\nIt also includes a voluntary buyout of pensions for vested former workers and for 3 percent cost of living increases due current workers in retirement — moves that are expected to save the state about $423 million in fiscal 2019.\nIllinois’ $129 billion unfunded pension liability, along with a chronic structural budget deficit that worsened during the impasse, led to a series of credit rating downgrades that left the lowest-rated state a notch or two above junk level.\nCredit rating analysts have said they are looking for the new budget to take steps towards addressing the state’s financial problems.
