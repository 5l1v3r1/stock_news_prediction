Its contents list past criminal records, social media accounts and personal information used to identify so-called gang members.\nThe police database even lists the type of music and videos watched online. Those listed are given a \"violence ranking\" in green, amber or red.\nAmnesty said that the \"deeply flawed\" database, frequently shared with local governing bodies, violated young people's privacy rights.\nThe human rights watchdog said police had been known to use fake online profiles to \"covertly befriend\" people in a bid to monitor what they did online.\n\"It is clear that many people are being profiled based on factors that have nothing to do with serious offending, but rather on indicators of youth culture.
