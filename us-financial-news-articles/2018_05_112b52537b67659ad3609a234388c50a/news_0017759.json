(OTCQB:QUES), a specialty systems integrator focused on field and supply chain mobility announced progress on its turnaround plan and its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nTurnaround\nTotal operating expenses decreased $1M to $12.2M for year ended December 31, 2017, a $1.1 saving following the execution of August 2017 turnaround plan. Efficiency steps including consolidation of operations and a 44% reduction in headcount partially impacted 2017 and will have a full impact on 2018 results. $15.4M of debt was eliminated by settlement agreements; Minimal potential dilution of up to 15% of the Company shares. Shareholders’ Equity as of December 31, 2017 improved by $13.6M to a deficit of $1.2 compared to a deficit of $14.8M in 2016. Total liabilities as of December 31, 2017 decreased by over $20 million.\nFinancial Results:\nNet cash provided from operations increased to $7.5M in fiscal year 2017 from $5.7M in 2016. Revenue for 2017 was $54.5M down from $60M in 2016 due to a discharge of non-profitable business. Adjusted EBITDA plus Stock Based Compensation for Fiscal Year 2017 increased by 78% to $1.78M Net loss from Continuous Operations decreased from $7.5M in fiscal year 2016 to $2.4 in Fiscal Year 2017. Approximately $12M decrease in Net loss attributable to the common stockholders from $14.2M ($0.4 per share) to $2.1 ($0.06 per share).\n.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Quest reported revenues of $54.5 million, compared to $60.0 million in the comparable 2016 period. Gross margin improved slightly to 21% for fiscal 2017 compared to 20% in fiscal 2016, During the year the Company drove a $466,000 or 20% reduction in general and administrative expense and a $457,000 or 5% reduction in salary and benefits. During 2017 the Company expensed $750,745 in non-cash stock based compensation. Excluding the charge for non-cash stock compensation, and over $145K of tax expense included in general and administrative expense, Quest would have achieved operating income for full year 2017. Total operational expenses for 2017 were over $1M less than in 2106. Net loss attributable to the common stockholders improved significantly to $2.1million, or a loss of $0.06 per share, compared to a net loss of $14.2 million, or a loss of $0.40 per share in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus Stock Based Compensation) for full year 2017 improved by 78% to $1,780,245, or 3.3% of sales, compared to $977,473, or 1.6% of sales for the previous year.\nShai Lustgarten, CEO, commented, “In July 2017, a new board of directors was elected to Quest Solution. The Board and new management team inherited a business with excellent customers and a strong reputation in the supply chain sector. We also inherited an extremely weak balance sheet, a consistent history of operating losses and the consequences of an acquisition that resulted in million of dollars of losses which coupled with these historic losses resulted in a $14M Shareholders Equity deficit. Management has initiated an aggressive turnaround plan including actions to drive a return to profitability, generate positive cash flow and improve the Company’s financial strength by negotiating with noteholders a settlement on their approximately $18M worth of notes. The plan also includes the addition of new technologies to our product offerings, and increasing margins and differentiating ourselves from our competitors. We have implemented efficiency measures by consolidating operations, cutting our headcount by approximately 44% and instituting other operational costs that favorably impacted a portion of the 2017 results. We expect that they will have a full impact on our 2018 financials. Following the close of the quarter, we announced a $15 million reduction of our notes liability. This positive development represents a significant improvement in our financial situation, but resulted in a delay in the release of our financial statements, as we needed to ensure that the transactions were properly accounted for. The combination of our efficiency measures and this meaningful debt reduction have improved Quest’s financial strength and stockholders’ equity, increased cash flow and profitability, and established the foundation for a healthier company going forward.\"\n“We established clear goals for the turnaround of Quest and have made solid progress against these goals thus far. These goals included:\nImproving the balance sheet Delivering sustained profitability by realizing efficiencies Improving performance by changing company culture, motivating employees and consolidating operations Adding advanced new technologies to elevate Quest’s profile as a high-tech company offering unique solutions, driving margin improvement and a stronger market position\n“We are seeing tremendous opportunities in the evolving and growing markets in which we operate, and we are better positioned today to capitalize on these opportunities. Quest has built a solid base of blue chip customers and we are focused on expanding our customer reach as we continue to increase our capabilities and offerings. We remain focused on developing new and enhanced solutions to improve our competitive positioning with a particular focus on offering higher margin software solutions and services. This is a very exciting time for our Company and we remain dedicated to executing on the initiatives we’ve embarked upon to establish a profitable business with leadership position in the supply chain marketplace. I would like to thank our great team of employees, consultants and customers who have enabled us to execute this plan for the benefit of our shareholders.”\nPlease refer to the financial tables included below for a reconciliation of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to non-GAAP financial results.
