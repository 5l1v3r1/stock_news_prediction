What’s more important are the problem-solving skills that you can’t learn in a classroom, panelists at WSJ’s Cybersecurity Executive Forum said Thursday.\nThe lack of diversity in gender and race in the cybersecurity industry is a hot topic, but cybersecurity company executives at the panel said what’s sometimes overlooked is the importance of diversity in soft skills, such as creativity, problem-solving and a strong willingness to continuously learn.\n“There’s a lot of people graduating from fine cybersecurity programs but they’re missing that core skill set of problem solving, (having) no fear,” said Theresa Payton, president and chief executive of Fortalice Solutions and former chief information officer of the White House.\nMs. Payton herself started a career as a developer working on artificial intelligence and big data analytics, she said. One of the best network security engineers and security analysts she has on staff currently is a former network administrator and network engineer who is an “insatiable problem-solver” and knows how to find consensus, she said.\nMeerah Rajavel, chief information officer at Forcepoint, said one of her best cybersecurity hires didn’t have the technical skills but knew how to ask the right questions and solve difficult problems from his risk and governance background.\n“Cognitive diversity is more important than anything for a cybersecurity person,” she said.\nThe panelists spoke about hiring cybersecurity talent amid grim statistics: The number of unfilled cybersecurity positions is expected to reach more than 1.8 million globally by 2022, according to a 2017 report from (ISC)2 , a nonprofit association.\nJames Stickland, chief executive at Veridium, said hiring cybersecurity talent is about finding the right attitude versus aptitude.\nWhat’s also critical is being able to keep their jobs interesting and fulfilling once they’ve been hired. “A lot of it is about intellectual reward, not necessarily about financial outcomes. It’s about how you keep them intellectually stimulated,” he said.\nShare this: CYBERSECURITY IT SKILLS GAP SOFT SKILLS TALENT Previous The Morning Download: Chatbots Push Software Developers Into New Territory", "external_links": ["http://tk.wsjemail.com/track?type=click&enid=ZWFzPTEmbXNpZD0xJmF1aWQ9NzYwODA0MyZtYWlsaW5naWQ9Njc2NjcwMSZtZXNzYWdlaWQ9MTMzNDAwMCZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMzk3MDAmc2VyaWFsPTE3MDY1NTY0JmVtYWlsaWQ9QWRhbS5KYW5vZnNreUB3c2ouY29tJnVzZXJpZD1BZGFtLkphbm9mc2t5QHdzai5jb20mdGFyZ2V0aWQ9Jm1uPTIzNyZmbD0mbXZpZD0mZXh0cmE9JiYm&&&5869300069612&&&https://www.isc2.org/News-and-Events/Press-Room/Posts/2017/06/07/2017-06-07-Workforce-Shortage?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy&mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy"], "published": "2018-05-24T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:28:40.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
