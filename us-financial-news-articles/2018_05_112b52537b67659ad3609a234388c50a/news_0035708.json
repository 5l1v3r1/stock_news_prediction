On Thursday, it urged the government to act against growing calls to boycott the election.\nIn a Facebook video posting, the Cambodia National Rescue Movement (CNRM), an opposition group launched by Sam Rainsy, a former CNRP leader, also called for an election boycott.\n“Cambodians won’t go to vote ... won’t vote for the dictator,” ran a song in the video, referring to Hun Sen.
