USG has advised Knauf that it is prepared to agree to a customary confidentiality agreement to facilitate sharing appropriate due diligence information.\nThe Board believes that by entering into negotiations and exchanging certain information, Knauf should be able to identify additional sources of value in combining the businesses and will see value in excess of its most recent proposal.\nThere can be no assurance that the negotiation process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing. The Company has not set a timetable for completion of negotiations and does not intend to disclose developments related to the process unless and until definitive agreements are reached or negotiations are abandoned.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 related to management's expectations about future conditions, including but not limited to, statements regarding the indication of interest made by Knauf and uncertainties regarding future actions that may be taken by Knauf in furtherance of such interest and the Company’s authorized commencement of negotiations with Knauf regarding a potential sale of the Company.
