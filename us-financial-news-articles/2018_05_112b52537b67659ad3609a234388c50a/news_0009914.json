LJM later told clients it would return what was left of their money.\nIn Wednesday’s filing, LJM’s lawyers denied an earlier claim by Wells Fargo that the fund company is now likely to be insolvent.\nInvestors are suing Caine and Anish Parvataneni, a portfolio manager at LJM who previously worked for well-known fund investor Ken Griffin’s Citadel, over what they said was inadequate disclosure about the risks of LJM’s investment approach.
