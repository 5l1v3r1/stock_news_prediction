The brand is available only to Amazon Prime subscribers , who pay monthly or annual fees in exchange for fast delivery as well as video and music streaming.\nThe move is a threat to Petco Animal Supplies and PetSmart (petm) , which purchased Chewy.com last year for more than $3 billion, as well as big box retailers and supermarkets that sell pet supplies. Dog food is a difficult item to sell profitably online because it’s heavy and expensive to ship. It appeals to Amazon as a product pet owners purchase frequently, keeping the online marketplace top of mind during buying decisions. It is also a major staple for grocery stores and retail competitor Walmart (wmt) , which has its own private label dog foods, including Ol’ Roy.\nWag.com, which was previously owned by Quidsi, now redirects to Amazon’s pet supplies page, which includes a new icon for the private-label dog food. The e-commerce giant closed Quidsi last year, saying it couldn’t make a profit. Seattle-based Amazon purchased Quidsi, which also owned Diapers.com and Soap.com, for $545 million in 2011 to eliminate a competitor and gain customers.\nU.S. pet owners will spend $72.1 billion on animals , care and supplies this year, with about $30 billion on pet food, according to the American Pet Products Association.\nAmazon began selling pet beds and carriers under the AmazonBasics brand in 2016, with pet carrier sales totaling $2 million last year, according to a March report by One Click Retail, which monitors e-commerce sales.\nAmazon’s other recent private-label pushes include bedroom, dining-room and office furniture under the Rivet and Stone & Beam lines. It also reintroduced its own diapers under the Mama Bear brand last year after killing a diaper brand three years earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T16:07:54.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
