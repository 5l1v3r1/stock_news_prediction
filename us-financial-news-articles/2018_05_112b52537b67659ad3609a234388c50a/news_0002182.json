Messrs. Kelly and Perrotta couldn’t be reached for comment.\nMr. Pruitt is under investigation by the White House, inspector general of the EPA, House oversight committee and Government Accountability Office over spending on security, lodging, and travel, along with allegations that he pushed out staffers who criticized his decisions. He has denied the allegations and noted that ethics officers cleared the actions.\nMr. Perrotta is scheduled to appear for a transcribed interview with House oversight-committee staffers Wednesday and an aide said that would still go ahead. “His resignation will not impact his appearance before the committee.”\nMr. Perrotta oversaw controversial actions taken in the name of Mr. Pruitt’s security, including a $43,000 secure phone booth in his office, first-class travel and a security detail during personal travel including a trip to Disneyland.\nDemocrats have raised questions about whether Mr. Kelly should have had a position such of responsibility at the EPA after Oklahoma regulators banned him from the banking industry.\nMr. Pruitt praised both men for their service, saying in the statement that Mr. Kelly “will be sorely missed” and wishing Mr. Perrotta “the very best in retirement.” He didn’t provide any details on the reason for their departures and the EPA declined to comment beyond its statement.\nRep. Don Beyer (D, Va.), who recently asked the EPA’s inspector general to investigate Mr. Kelly’s hiring and work at the agency, called the departures of two of Mr. Pruitt’s closest aides an indication of “how toxic” the administrator has become.\n“ Albert Kelly was never qualified to run Superfund, his banking ban was a huge red flag, and his resignation is a positive development,” Mr. Beyer said in a statement.\nOthers, however, praised Mr. Kelly’s work to improve and speed the process of cleaning up the Superfund hazardous waste sites.\n“Mr. Kelly really did appear to be a champion for these sites,” said Dawn Chapman, head of a nonprofit called Just Moms STL that has long campaigned for the cleanup of a polluted St. Louis landfill . She said Mr. Kelly was extremely accessible, handing out his cellphone number and immediately picking up when she called. He also visited the St. Louis site twice and worked to get attention for their plight, Ms. Chapman said.\n—Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.\nWrite to Heidi Vogt at heidi.vogt@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T07:37:11.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
