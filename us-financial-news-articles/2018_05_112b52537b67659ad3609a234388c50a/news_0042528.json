There are also rapid exchanges of gunfire before and after the blasts, although it is not clear where the shots were coming from.\nThe assailants, who numbered around a dozen, then load sacks into at least two get-away cars before speeding away. Motorists caught up in the shoot-out are seen pulling U-turns across the road to escape the scene.\nPolice said two security guards in the cash vans were injured in the incident and were treated in hospital. They also said some of the robbers were arrested after being tracked by helicopter to a run-down industrial park.\nSecurity experts quoted in South African media said the way the assailants behaved and handled the weapons suggested they had military backgrounds.
