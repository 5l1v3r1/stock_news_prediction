It goes under the heading of you need to do things that make him uncomfortable, make him think twice, get inside his head.”\nThere is a solid logic to O’Shannessy’s argument — in that Nadal stands a huge distance behind the baseline when receiving on clay, allowing him time to impart massive amounts of topspin and loop on his returns.\n“Rafa backs up so far when he’s receiving serve he’s halfway to Moscow. So an underarm serve? Why not?” O’Shannessy said.\n“People think it’s illegal. But it’s a legit shot. I’m not advocating a player continually doing it because a player like Rafa would adjust. An underarm serve might not win the point, but it throws a curve ball into the match.\n“You need an agent of disruption. Perhaps a slow serve and volley, more drop shots. Do something radical.”\nWhen Thiem beat Nadal in Madrid he used the higher altitude and thinner air to step in and take the ball much earlier than he usually does — rushing Nadal and dictating rallies.\nIt is a tactic Alexander Zverev also used in Rome where he pushed Nadal to three sets in the final.\nWhile the good news is that Thiem proved Nadal is mortal on clay, the bad news, according to three-times French Open champion and Eurosport pundit Mats Wilander, is that this year’s Nadal is perhaps the best version yet.\n“I see no chinks in his armor really,” the Swede told Reuters. “He is playing as well as ever. Better technically with his backhand more aggressive. Because of that it frees up his first serve and he can go for more.\n“The only chink is that the younger players don’t have the same fear factor when playing him. They don’t have the baggage.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:21:42.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
