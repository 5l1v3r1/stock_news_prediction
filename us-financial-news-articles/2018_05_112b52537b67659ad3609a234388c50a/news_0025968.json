We also continue to work with our surgeon investigators on our commercialization plans in both the U.S. and Japanese markets, and are pursuing additional NeoCart licensing and partnership opportunities in other major international markets. Our objective is to make NeoCart available to as many patients as possible with a goal of maximizing the clinical and commercial value of this innovative, restorative cell therapy that treats pain at the source,” continued Mr. Gridley.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights\nRelease of NeoCart top-line Phase 3 Data and Submission of Biologics License Application on Track for Third Quarter 2018: Histogenics expects to report top-line data from its 249-patient Phase 3 randomized, controlled clinical trial of NeoCart in the third quarter of 2018. The trial is designed to show superiority of NeoCart at one year after treatment as compared to microfracture, the current standard of care. The trial will follow patients for three years and is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the United States Food and Drug Administration.\nDevelopment of Additional NeoCart Biomechanical Data to Support Potential Commercialization: As part of their Sponsored Research Agreement, Histogenics and Cornell University (Cornell) continue to build upon the robust body of evidence related to the biomechanical properties of NeoCart, with additional data that were presented at the Orthopaedic Research Society Annual Meeting in March 2018. The body of data is intended to provide additional mechanism of action and physical competence information to regulatory agencies and clinicians regarding the potential performance advantages of NeoCart when compared to other treatment alternatives. Furthermore, Histogenics and Cornell are working together in related areas including the novel testing and three-dimensional printing of cartilage tissue. Histogenics believes this work may have significant utility in identifying and supporting additional future product opportunities including the automation of certain aspects of the NeoCart manufacturing process.\nExpansion and Enhancement of Board of Directors : In April 2018, Susan Washer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Applied Genetic Technologies (AGTC) joined Histogenics’ Board of Directors. Ms. Washer has served as CEO of AGTC, a company developing genetic therapies to treat patients with rare inherited conditions, since 2002. She also serves on the boards of Biotechnology Innovation Organization and the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine.\nReceipt of MEDINET Licensing Agreement Proceeds and Completion of Financing: Histogenics received a $10 million up-front payment from MEDINET Co., Ltd. (MEDINET) pursuant to the terms of the license agreement with MEDINET for the development and commercialization of NeoCart in Japan. In addition, Histogenics successfully completed a registered direct offering of common stock in January 2018 that raised proceeds of $5.7 million, after deducting underwriter’s discounts and commissions, and expenses related to the offering.\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter of 2018\nLoss from operations was $(6.1) million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $(6.8) million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating expenses was driven by a reduction in research and development expenses which was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in costs related to the NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial, for which enrollment was completed in June 2017. General and administrative expenses were $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and consulting expenses related to increased activities to support the potential commercialization of NeoCart.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $(14.4) million in the first quarter of 2018, or $(0.52) per share, compared to $(5.8) million, or $(0.27) per share, in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders is primarily due to the conversion of convertible preferred stock into common stock and an increase in expense related to the fair value of the warrant liability which was partially offset by lower operating expenses.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Histogenics had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $15.5 million, compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2017. Histogenics believes its current cash position will be sufficient to fund its operations into the fourth quarter of 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nHistogenics management will host a conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

Histogenics’ lead investigational product, NeoCart, is designed to rebuild a patient’s own knee cartilage to treat pain at the source and potentially prevent a patient’s progression to osteoarthritis. NeoCart is one of the most rigorously studied restorative cell therapies for orthopedic use. Histogenics recently completed enrollment of its NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial and expects to report top-line, one-year superiority data in the third quarter of 2018. NeoCart is designed to perform like articular hyaline cartilage at the time of treatment, and as a result, may provide patients with more rapid pain relief and accelerated recovery as compared to the current standard of care. Histogenics’ technology platform has the potential to be used for a broad range of additional restorative cell therapy indications.
