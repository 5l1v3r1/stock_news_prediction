At the time of the bond issue, CEFC Shanghai International had a AAA long-term credit rating from domestic ratings agency China Lianhe Credit Rating Co.\nChina Lianhe downgraded CEFC Shanghai’s rating to B on May 15, the fourth time it had downgraded the issuer’s rating in less than three months.\nThe default by CEFC Shanghai is the latest in a wave of corporate debt defaults amid a broad campaign to crack down on risky financing, and follows a reminder on Friday from China’s securities regulator that exchanges should monitor default risks.\n“This is only an appetizer, (there are) more defaults to come,” said a fixed-income portfolio manager in Shanghai.\nCEFC Shanghai has 12 outstanding bonds worth a total of 27.6 billion yuan, according to Reuters Eikon data, including bonds worth 8.1 billion yuan maturing this year.
