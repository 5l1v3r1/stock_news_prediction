Comey has said and written about prior discussions with Trump in which the former FBI boss says the president sought personal loyalty. Trump also requested Comey let go a federal investigation into former national security advisor Mike Flynn .\nTrump has denied Comey's assertions.\nThe administration has said Trump fired Comey over his handling of the investigations into Hillary Clinton during the campaign.\nBut in an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt that aired two days after Trump fired Comey, the president said: \"When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'\"\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, Comey's predecessor as FBI director, to take over the Russia probe after Trump fired Comey. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the investigation.\nTrump has often slammed Mueller, Sessions and Rosenstein, while calling the probe a \"witch hunt.\" He has also repeatedly denied any collusion took place.\nRepresentatives for the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n—CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T07:23:14.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
