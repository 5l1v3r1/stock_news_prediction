If the policy turns out in certain ways, then business can go forward.\"\nMarkets reacted negatively to the morning news, with the Dow industrials down about 200 points and government bond yields down substantially as well.\nIn a letter to Kim Jung Un , Trump said that recent rhetoric from North Korea made a summit impossible at this point.\nTrump also announced possible new tariffs on imported vehicles to the U.S. even as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin earlier this week said a trade war with China had been averted at least for the moment.\n\"You're at the fork in the road, and there are multiple ways you can go,\" Bostic said. \"What I'm hearing from business is we're going to wait and we're going to see what happens, and I think that will offset some of the impact.\"\nOn other matters, Bostic said he thinks the Fed is getting close to the end of its rate-hiking cycle.\nThe so-called neutral rate, he said, is probably around 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent, which would imply three to five more increases in the Fed's benchmark funds rate. The comments came a day after the Federal Open Market Committee, of which Bostic is a voting member, released minutes from a meeting earlier this month that indicated officials are comfortable with letting inflation run a little hot for a short period as the economy grows.\n\"For me, I think we get to the neutral and we let the economy work,\" Bostic said.\nCorrection: Bostic's Fed affiliation was misstated in an earlier version .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:29:40.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
