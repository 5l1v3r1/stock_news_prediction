China's lawmakers could simply choose to wait until the president's various issues are resolved — or until his four-year term is over.\n\"This narrative has become so ingrained that we have come to expect every stock to go down as it's repeated,\" Cramer said. \"We'd like to think that the stocks of companies that have little to do with trade, or at least anything domestic, ... would somehow be immune, but if they're in the S&P 500 , they go down.\"\nBig hedge fund managers and individual investors alike have flocked to index funds like the S&P 500 in recent months, causing stocks to trade in tandem as the three Ts — Trump, tariffs and trade — fuel the market's concerns, Cramer explained.\nBut the broad-based declines have brought some courageous buyers out of the woodwork, too, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"Periodically we get bargain-hunters [who come in] and basically say, 'Enough is already enough. It can't possibly be this bad,'\" Cramer said. \"Look, they might be right. Maybe there will be no negative headlines about Trump tomorrow — hey, crazier things have happened.\"\nBetter yet, if Trump's National Economic Advisor and former CNBC host Larry Kudlow is optimistic about his meetings in China this week, the bargain-hunters could really luck out, Cramer said.\n\"Or perhaps [tomorrow] will just be another lousy Friday like all the rest of them as people worry about what'll happen this weekend with China,\" he said. \"If you have one takeaway from today, it should be that there comes a point where everyone is collectively too negative for that very moment, and that's when you have to take the other side of the trade.\"\nWATCH: Cramer on 3 troubling Ts: Trump, tariffs and trade show chapters Cramer on trade: China could wait out Trump's presidency to make a trade deal, and that's bad for stocks 20 Hours Ago | 11:27 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
