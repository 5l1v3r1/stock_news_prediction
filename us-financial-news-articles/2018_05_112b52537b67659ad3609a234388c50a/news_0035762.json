They are Namibia, Palau, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and the three United Statesâ€™ territories of American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nThe EU blacklist was set up last December after several revelations of widespread tax avoidance schemes used by corporations and wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills.\nBlacklisted jurisdictions could face reputational damage and stricter controls on their financial transactions with the EU, although no sanctions have been agreed by EU states yet.\nThose who are on the grey list could be moved to the blacklist if they do not honor their commitments.\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:00:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
