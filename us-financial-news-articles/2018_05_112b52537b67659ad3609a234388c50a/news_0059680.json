REUTERS/Juan Medina Browder was in Madrid to give evidence to Jose Grinda, a Spanish prosecutor who spearheads investigations into organized crime, about money from the Magnitsky case that has flowed to Spain, the British businessman said on Twitter.\nHe later posted a tweet and photograph of himself at Madrid’s Barajas airport saying he had cleared Spanish immigration without problems and was on his way back to London.\nMagnitsky was arrested in 2008 shortly after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. His death nearly a year later while awaiting trial caused an international uproar.\nBrowder has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of a personal vendetta over the businessman’s efforts to get other countries to impose so-called Magnitsky sanctions against Russian individuals.\nBritish foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he had spoken to Browder and was glad he had been released.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of Magnitsky to justice,” Johnson said in a tweet.\nWriting by Paul Day; Editing by Sonya Dowsett and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:08:04.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
