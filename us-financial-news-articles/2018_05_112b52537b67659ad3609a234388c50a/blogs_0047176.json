We believe most of the (comparable-store sales) pressure to be more transitory in nature than structural,\" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. Getty Images A Lowe's employee walks through the store during the grand opening of the Lowe's store in San Francisco, California.\nLike Lowe's, its bigger peer Home Depot last week blamed cold weather for missing Wall Street estimates on same-store sales for the first time in seven quarters.\nLowe's maintained its annual forecast for profit and same-store sales, while slightly raising its estimate for sales growth to reflect an accounting change.\nThe company's net income rose to $988 million or $1.19 per share in the first quarter, while sales rose nearly 3 percent to $17.36 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.22 per share and revenue of $17.46 billion.\nOn Tuesday, Mooresville-North Carolina-based Lowe's said current J.C. Penney CEO Marvin Ellison would be taking over at Lowe's , replacing Niblock, who held the position for 13 years.
