That was just shy of the company’s guidance and the average expectation of 1.856 billion euros in a Reuters poll of 11 analysts.\n“Our order books are bulging,” Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss said in a statement. “We therefore are very confident that we will achieve our revenue targets for the 2018 fiscal year.”\nSegment result, a measure of profitability across Infineon’s operating units, rose 6 percent year-on-year to 315 million euros compared with average expectations of 298 million, while margins expanded to 17.1 percent.\nAdjusted earnings per share were 26 euro cents, compared to poll expectations of 21 cents.\nInfineon forecast sequential revenue growth of 3 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, in the third quarter, with a segment margin of around 17 percent.
