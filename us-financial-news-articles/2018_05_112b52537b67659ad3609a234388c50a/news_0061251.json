Companies that want to classify workers as independent contractors must now prove they are not under their direct control, do not perform a core function of their business and are engaged in an independent business.\nUber and Lyft drivers are classified as independent contractors, and they lack paid sick and vacation days and must pay their own expenses, such as car maintenance and gasoline.\n\"We don't know whether these ride-hailing companies are breaking the law until they provide the information we seek in these subpoenas,\" Herrera said. \"We are going to ensure that these companies comply with the Supreme Court's ruling and with San Francisco's laws.\"\nUber and Lyft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
