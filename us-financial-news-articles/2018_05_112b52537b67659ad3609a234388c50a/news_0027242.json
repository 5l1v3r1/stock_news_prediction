All the series we hosted were not always profitable. If we can conduct them, we would expect the other cricket boards, especially bigger ones like Cricket Australia, to do the same.\n“We have proposed a shorter version as an alternative. But it looks like they are not continuing. So, this series is not going to happen.”\nIn the ICC’s Future Tours Programme, Bangladesh’s tour was pencilled in for the Australian winter, when football codes occupy the main cricket stadiums and dominate sports broadcasting.\nBangladesh’s last test tour of Australia was in 2003 when they suffered innings losses in the tropical northern cities of Darwin and Cairns and it is likely such venues would have been considered if the 2018 tour had gone ahead.\nAustralia drew 1-1 with Bangladesh in a two-test series last year, their first tour of the country since 2011 after Cricket Australia cancelled a trip in 2015 citing security concerns.
