He fled Russia after he received threats for saying he did not mourn the victims of a Russian defence ministry plane crash in 2016.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described allegations by Ukrainian government officials that Moscow was behind the murder as “the height of cynicism” and said he hoped other countries would lean on Kiev to do more to protect journalists.
