They had led or been tied for the lead in the NL West every day of the season until the Colorado Rockies passed them Monday night.\nBrewers right-hander Jhoulys Chacin pitched five scoreless innings before Matt Albers (3-1), Josh Hader and Corey Knebel finished up. Knebel recorded his third save.\nMilwaukee first baseman Ji-Man Choi doubled and Cain walked to open the sixth inning off Arizona starter Matt Koch (2-3) before the runners moved up on a slow roller by Travis Shaw. Santana greeted reliever Jorge De La Rosa with a sacrifice fly.\nIn the fourth inning, Arizona center fielder Jarrod Dyson leaped and got his glove over the fence to take a three-run homer away from Santana. Dyson also took a homer away from Houston’s Jake Marisnick on May 4 while playing right field.\nThe Diamondbacks have three runs and 12 hits in their past three games and have scored 24 runs in their past 13 games.\nKoch gave up three hits and one run in 5 1/3 innings, with a season-high five strikeouts and three walks.\nChacin gave up two hits while striking out six and walking four. He has not lost since April 4, his second start of the season, and he has a 1.54 ERA in four May starts. He gave up two hits and one run in a no-decision last Wednesday.\nCain lined a single to left field to with two outs in the fourth inning after Koch retired the first 11. Shaw walked before Dyson got his glove over the fence to snare Santana’s long fly. Santana had homered in each of his previous two games against Milwaukee.\nCain threw out Diamondbacks shortstop Ketel Marte attempting to stretch a single in the second inning. He made a diving catch in short center field and doubled Ketel Marte off first base to end the seventh.\nDyson was thrown out attempting to steal second in the eighth, and Nick Ahmed was thrown out attempting to steal second in the ninth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:16:10.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
