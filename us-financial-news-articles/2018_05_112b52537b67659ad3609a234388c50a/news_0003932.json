The rains typically begin in April and peak in July, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department says.\nU.N. officials say some 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh from Myanmar’s Rakhine state to escape a military crackdown since August, amid reports of murder, rape and arson by Myanmar troops and Buddhist vigilantes in actions which the United Nations has likened to “ethnic cleansing”.\nMyanmar has denied nearly all allegations, saying it has been waging a legitimate counter-insurgency operation.
