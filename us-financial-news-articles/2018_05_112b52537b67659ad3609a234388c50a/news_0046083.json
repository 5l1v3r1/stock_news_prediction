For Kiev to remain “comfortable” next year, bond market lenders will have to ‘rollover’ — re-lend — 100 percent of their loans to the country.\nHowever, if that ‘rollover’ rate stayed at last year’s 85 percent level the government would face a $3 billion funding gap and one of $5.5 billion if rate dropped down to 75 percent.\n“Unless capital inflows pick up substantially, Ukraine will likely need fresh IMF support in coming years,” to meet its needs, the IIF analysis said.\n“The cumulative financing gap for 2019-21 could reach $16.5 billion, or 90 percent of international reserves in a low rollover rate scenario.”\nUkraine’s current IMF programme is due to finish next year. The country has so far received $8.4 billion of what was originally supposed to be $17.5 billion of aid.\nIts overall amount of short-term debt has fallen and its reserves have more than doubled during the programme, but both are projected to reverse these moves as it comes to an end.\nBetween now and 2021 it has $20 billion of IMF and other ‘official sector’ debt payments due. The government’s revenues will also be squeezed, the IIF said, as new gas pipes allow Russia to pump its gas around Ukraine rather than through it, meaning it will no longer have to pay transit fees.
