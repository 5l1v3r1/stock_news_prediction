It has declined 0.2 percent so far this month after a 1.5 percent fall in April.\n“The market was dull today as investors are worried over the global uncertainties on top of local issues,” a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.\n“The central bank sold to select banks at 157.90 rupees per dollar.”\nOfficials at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were not immediately available for comments.\nThe dollar eased slightly from 2018 highs ahead of U.S. April inflation numbers on Thursday and as currency markets eyed the Bank of England’s policy meeting and inflation report.\nThe rupee will stabilise and the monetary authority will intervene to smooth high volatility as there is no reason for a weaker currency, Nandalal Weerasinghe, senior deputy governor at the central bank, said last week.\nThe central bank said on April 26 it would intervene to support the rupee when necessary and that there was no reason for the rupee to be under pressure given the country’s record $10 billion foreign currency reserves.\nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government. But Weerasinghe on Thursday said debt repayment by the government will not have an impact on the currency.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 5.7 billion rupees ($36.20 million) in the week ended May 2, bringing the outflow so far this year to 5.8 billion rupees, central bank data showed.
