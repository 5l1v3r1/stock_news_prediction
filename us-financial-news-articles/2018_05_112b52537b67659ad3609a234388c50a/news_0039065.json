(NYSE American: RVP) reports the following results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to results for the same period in the prior year. The operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 decreased from $1.152 million to $157 thousand, a decrease of $995 thousand, or 86.4%.\nDomestic sales accounted for 86.0% and 85.9% of our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Domestic revenues increased 10.9% principally due to higher volumes and a higher average selling price. Domestic unit sales increased 9.0%. Domestic unit sales were 76.6% of total unit sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018. International unit sales and revenues increased 56.8% and 10.2%, respectively, due to higher unit sales mitigated by lower average selling prices. Our international orders may be subject to significant fluctuation over time. Overall unit sales increased 17.3%.\nGross profit increased 23.0% primarily due to higher sales volume.\nThe average cost of manufactured products sold per unit decreased by 11.2% due to higher unit production. Profit margins can fluctuate depending upon, among other things, the cost of manufactured product and the capitalized cost of product recorded in inventory, as well as product sales mix. Royalty expense increased 7.5% due to increased gross sales.\nOperating expenses decreased 13.2% or $461 thousand. The decrease was primarily due to bonuses paid in 2017, reduced litigation costs, and no stock option expense incurred in 2018.\nCash comprises 40.6% of total assets. Working capital was $18.5 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $173 thousand from December 31, 2017.\nCash flow provided by operations was $459 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 due primarily to collection of accounts receivable outstanding at the end of the year, mitigated by increased inventory and payment of accounts payable.\nFurther details concerning the results of operations as well as other matters are available in Retractable's Form 10-Q filed on May 15, 2018 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRetractable manufactures and markets VanishPoint ® and Patient Safe ® safety medical products and the EasyPoint ® needle.
