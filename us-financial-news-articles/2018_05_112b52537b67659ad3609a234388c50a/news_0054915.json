The maximum penalty is seven years.\nThe woman, in her 40s, received two concurrent three-and-a- half year jail sentences for duping her daughter into leaving Britain to get married and for forcing her into marriage.\nShe was jailed for a further year for committing perjury at the High Court.\nKarma Nirvana, a charity supporting forced marriage victims, hailed the verdict as “very significant”.\n“It sets a massive precedent,” said Natasha Rattu, a lawyer at Karma Nirvana. “If you are not prosecuting anybody under the law it will not have any deterrent effect.”\nThe government’s Forced Marriage Unit received reports of nearly 2,000 possible cases last year, many involving girls from South Asian backgrounds. But campaigners say the figure is just the tip of the iceberg.\nDetective Superintendent Sally Holmes of West Midlands Police praised the victim’s “extraordinary” bravery.\n“Anyone who is considering marrying a person against their will must understand that we will thoroughly investigate any such offences, wherever they take place in the world,” she said.\nEditing by Claire Cozens, Belinda Goldsmith and Katy Migiro.
