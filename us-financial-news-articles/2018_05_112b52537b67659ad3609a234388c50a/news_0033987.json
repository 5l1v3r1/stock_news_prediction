REUTERS/Beawiharta\nHe said the imprisonment of JAD’s leader, Aman Abdurrahman, could be another motive, and cited clashes with Islamist prisoners at jail near Jakarta last week in which five counter-terrorism officers were killed.\nIn another incident in Sidoarjo, south of Surabya, Karnavian said police recovered unexploded pipe bombs an apartment where an explosion killed three members of a family alleged to have been making bombs. Three children from the family survived and were taken to hospital.\nIn all, 25 people have died since Sunday in attacks, including 13 suspected militants, Karnavian said. CHILDREN USED IN ATTACKS\nCCTV footage of the blast outside the police station on Monday morning showed two motorbikes arriving at a checkpoint next to a car followed by an explosion as officers approached.\nSecurity experts said it was the first time in Indonesia that a child had been used by militants on a suicide mission.\n“The objective of using a family for terror acts is so it is not easily detected by the police,” said Indonesian terrorism analyst Stanislaus Riyanta.\nHe said that families could also avoid communicating using technology that could be tracked.\nIndonesia’s chief security minister said on Monday that police backed by the military would step up security across Indonesia.
