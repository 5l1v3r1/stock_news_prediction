It’s improving almost on a week-by-week basis,” he said.\nArcelorMittal said its average steel selling price was 18.2 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2017, with shipments up 1.4 percent. For iron ore, of which it mines more than 50 million tonnes a year, shipments rose 5.5 percent, while prices were down 13.1 percent.\nThe firm has been a vocal supporter of trade measures against cheap imports into both the United States and the European Union, where it has the bulk of its operations.\n“Comprehensive solution for unfairly trade imports across geographies still required,” ArcelorMittal said in an overview of EU and U.S. measures, including the 25 percent import tariffs imposed since March 23 by U.S. President Donald Trump, with certain temporary exemptions, such as for EU steel.\nThe principal target of such measures has been China, the world’s largest consumer and producer of steel and a key gauge for the global industry, even though ArcelorMittal itself has no direct exposure to the Chinese market.\nChinese steel exports declined at the start of the year as local demand has grown and the state has reined its domestic steel capacity to curb stifling smog. However, they jumped in April despite the U.S. tariffs.\nFILE PHOTO: Rolled up steel sits in the ArcelorMittal Dofasco steel plant in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, March 13, 2018.
