IAC owns more than 80 percent of Match Group.\nThe unit, which owns numerous online dating services, reported results on Tuesday that beat estimates and said Facebook’s dating tool would not hurt Tinder.\nEarlier this month, Facebook said it was developing a dating feature for its 2.2 billion monthly users. Following the announcement, IAC and Match Group lost about $5 billion in combined market value.\n“Tinder released a genie from the bottle and neither Facebook’s launch of a new profile page for single people nor anything else is going to put that genie back in,” IAC’s Chief Executive Officer Joey Levin said in a letter to shareholders.\nWhen asked if IAC plans to invest more in its dating businesses following Facebook’s announcement, Levin told Reuters there were no specific investments tied to that.\nRevenue from ANGI Homservices ANGI.O rose 69 percent to $255.3 million in the reported quarter, beating analysts’ estimate of about $252.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The unit accounted for a quarter of IAC’s total revenue.\nIAC created ANGI by merging its digital home services marketplace business with consumer review website operator Angie’s List that it bought last year.\nIAC has also been ramping up its efforts to expand its presence in the rapidly growing video market through Vimeo, which offers cloud-based video hosting, editing and sharing tools to individuals and business customers.\nTotal subcribers for Vimeo rose 13 percent to 901,000 in the first quarter.\nIAC’s net income more than doubled to $71.1 million, or 71 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $26.2 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier.\nTotal revenue rose about 31 percent to $995.1 million, topping analysts’ average estimate of $934.7 million.\nReporting by Pushkala Aripaka and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T00:33:27.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
