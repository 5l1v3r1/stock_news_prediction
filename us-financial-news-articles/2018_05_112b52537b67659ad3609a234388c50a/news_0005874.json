(NASDAQ:HNNA) today reported results for its second fiscal quarter , and announced a quarterly dividend.\nSummary Highlights (compared to prior comparable quarter ended March 31, 2017):\nFully diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.58. Our effective tax rate decreased from 38% to 24%.\nNote: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was passed during our first fiscal quarter, allowed us to blend in a lower corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018 (our second fiscal quarter). Total revenue increased 6% to $14.0 million. Total assets under management decreased 1% to $6.58 billion. Average assets under management, upon which revenue is earned, increased 4% to $6.90 billion.\nOur Board of Directors today also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, which will be paid on June 11, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 17, 2018.\n\"We are realizing favorable effects on our financials due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but we remain conservative in our application of the tax law changes as we await further IRS guidance,\" said Teresa Nilsen, President and COO of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. \"As we navigate the changes in the tax code, we are forging ahead with our business strategy of pursuing tactical acquisitions and growing organically,\" she added.\n\"The markets experienced a sharp rise in volatility during the quarter, driven by concerns over tariffs and possible trade wars, rising inflation and interest rates, and negative headlines about the Tech sector. Over the past year, I have shared my belief that the market was due for a correction, but that it would bounce back. I firmly believe both the market and the economy are resilient enough to rally through the discourse on trade, rate increases, and volatility,\" said Neil Hennessy, Chairman and CEO of Hennessy Advisors, Inc.\nHennessy Advisors, Inc.\nFinancial Highlights\nPeriod to Period\nThree Months Ended\nSecond Quarter\nMar. 31, 2018\nMar. 31, 2017\n$ Change\n% Change\nTotal Revenue\n$ 14,006,152\n$ 13,236,438\n$ 769,714\n5.8%\nNet Income\n$ 4,555,525\n$ 3,628,418\n$ 927,107\n25.6%\nEarnings Per Share (Diluted)\n$ 0.58\n$ 0.47\n$ 0.11\n23.4%\nWeighted Average Number of\nShares Outstanding (Diluted)\n7,886,380\n7,773,622\n112,758\n1.5%\nMutual Fund Average Assets\nUnder Management\n$ 6,904,516,776\n$ 6,634,570,676\n$ 269,946,100\n4.1%\nAt Period Ending Date\nMar. 31, 2018\nMar. 31, 2017\n$ Change\n% Change\nMutual Fund Total Assets\nUnder Management\n$ 6,577,379,155\n$ 6,635,802,239\n$ (58,423,084)\n-0.9%\nAbout Hennessy Advisors, Inc.\nHennessy Advisors, Inc. is a publicly traded investment manager offering a broad range of domestic equity, multi-asset, and sector and specialty mutual funds.
