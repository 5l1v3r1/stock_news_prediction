REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Like Kohl’s, Macy’s ( M.N ) raised its annual profit forecast but warned that the timing of promotions — shifting promotional events from the second quarter to the first — would be a “slight negative” on same-store sales in the second half of the year.\nMeanwhile, Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ) and J.C. Penney ( JCP.N ) reported lower-than-expected comparable sales for the first quarter.\nSales at Kohl’s stores open for at least 12 months climbed 3.6 percent in the first quarter ended May 5, with promotions contributing 320 basis points. Analysts on average had expected a 2.7 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“Looking at the big picture, Kohl’s comparable sales did increase ... this growth is still a strong story,” said Bob Phibbs, CEO of research firm Retail Doctor.\nKohl’s shares, which rose 6 percent in premarket trading, reversed course and fell as much as 7.4 percent to $60.62 in late morning trade.\nThe company’s net income rose 13.6 percent year-over-year to $75 million. Excluding one-time items, Kohl’s earned 64 cents per share, topping analysts’ estimates by 14 cents.\nRevenue rose 3.5 percent to $4.21 billion and exceeded expectations of $3.95 billion.\nReporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar, Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:23:29.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
