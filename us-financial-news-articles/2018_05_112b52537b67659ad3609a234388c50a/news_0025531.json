Actually FP1 (first practice) was even more difficult than we expected.\n“This morning we were slow but apart from being slow it was nearly impossible to keep the car on the track. That’s something we need to change.”\nKubica ended the session 19th out of the 20 drivers — a place ahead of teenage Canadian team mate Lance Stroll.\nIt was not his first time back behind the wheel of a Formula One car — he tested repeatedly last year while hoping to secure a race seat — and he said even some of the excitement was lacking.\n“I am satisfied with the session and how I react to difficult conditions and difficult balance,” he said. “It sounds strange that you can be happy about P19, but actually I am happy.\n“I was more emotional last year when I was jumping for the first time in the car. It’s already the sixth or seventh time I’m driving the F1 car, it’s becoming more natural, which is good,” he added.\nThe Pole partially severed his right arm in the 2011 accident when a steel guardrail penetrated both car and driver. The arm remains atrophied after extensive surgery, but Kubica has learned to drive around his limitations.\n“I have been in the school where they give you a bird in the hand and you have to hold it so it doesn’t fly away, but you cannot hold it too much that it gets scared,” he said as explanation.\n“And this is the way you have to hold the steering wheel.” Reporting Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:22:47.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
