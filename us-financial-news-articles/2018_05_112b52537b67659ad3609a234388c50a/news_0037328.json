Amsterdam determined to tame tourism Toby Sterling 3 Min Read\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Amsterdam unveiled far-reaching plans on Wednesday to rein in tourism, reflecting the dissatisfaction of many residents who feel the city’s historic centre has been overrun.

REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\nThe leading Green-Left and other parties negotiating a new municipal government after March elections vowed to return “Balance to the City”, in a document of that name seen by Reuters.\n“The positive sides of tourism such as employment and city revenues are being more and more overshadowed by the negative consequences” including trash and noise pollution, the document said.\nChanges the document outlines include curtailing “amusement transportation” such as multi-person “beer bikes”; cracking down on alcohol use in boats on the canals; further restricting AirBnB and other home rentals; and a large tax hike.\nThe plans announced on Wednesday also include creating an inventory of all commercial beds in the city to try to cap various sectors such as those on cruise ships and in hotels.

He also said some unruly, drunken tourists were making the city centre an unattractive place for local residents.
