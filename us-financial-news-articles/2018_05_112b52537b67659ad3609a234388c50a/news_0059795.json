The total value of the transaction is approximately $96 million. The Exeter Township wastewater system serves nearly 9,000 customers.\nPennsylvania American Water and the township will seek approval of the acquisition from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) and other necessary approvals from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The signing of the purchase agreement is the culmination of negotiations between Pennsylvania American Water and Exeter officials. The township’s Board of Supervisors voted on April 23, 2018, to accept the company’s proposal and sign the asset purchase agreement.

The company will partner with the township to identify areas where aging wastewater and water facilities can be replaced in conjunction with street and sidewalk improvements, economic development projects or other local infrastructure needs.\nThe company expects to close the transaction by the end of first quarter 2019, pending regulatory approvals.\nPennsylvania American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, is the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing high-quality and reliable water and/or wastewater services to approximately 2.4 million people.
