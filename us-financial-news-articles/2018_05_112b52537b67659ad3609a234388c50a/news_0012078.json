Today, we have the economy fixed, confidence regained, projects moving, and hopes rising,” said Mutharika.\nMalawi, which is experiencing power rationing due to inadequate generation, aims to more than double power supply from the current 360 Megawatts (MW) to 1,000 MW by 2023, by diversifying from hydro electricity generation to coal, wind, solar and gas, Mutharika said.\nMutharika said Malawi planned to build an international airport along Lake Malawi, as part of ambitious plans to turn the country’s tourism industry into a major source of revenue.\nThe lake, which has also been subject of oil exploration in recent years, covers more than half of the country and is a major tourist attraction.\nElections are due in Malawi in May 2019 and Mutharika has declared that he will seek a second term, despite recent criticism of his age. He will be 79 next year.
