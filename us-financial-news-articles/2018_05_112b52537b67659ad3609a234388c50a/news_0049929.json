Waha pumps around 260,000 bpd, officials have said.\nSome youths had also protested at Marada town’s lack of road links to other communities and demanded jobs, officials have said, a common grievance in Libya. The nation, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been in turmoil since the toppling of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.\nArmed groups have twice blown up the pipeline near Marada since December as security in the remote eastern area is volatile.\nReporting by Ayman al-Warfalli in Benghazi and Aidan Lewis in Cairo; Writing by Aidan Lewis and Ulf Laessing; Editing by Dale Hudson and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:17:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
