(“Zoom”) (OTCQB: ZMTP) (the “Company”), a leading producer of cable modems and other communication products, today reported its 2018 first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights (comparisons to prior year’s period)\nNet sales increased 62.0% to $8.3 million due to the strength of Zoom’s Motorola brand products; Gross margin improved to 39.4% from 33.7%; and Net income was approximately $359,000 or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million or $0.07 per share\nManagement Commentary\nFrank Manning, Zoom’s President and CEO, commented on the quarter, “We were pleased to report dramatic organic growth, fueled primarily by increased sales of our Motorola brand cable modems and gateways products. Zoom is continuing to grow market share as a result of customers choosing our Motorola products based on strong retail sales channels, product quality, favorable customer reviews, and value. This year we will introduce exciting new Motorola cable modem/routers as well as launch new Motorola routers, DSL and MoCA products, cellular modems, and cellular sensors. Our balance sheet remains solid, and we are excited about our prospects and future growth in the US as well other countries.”\n2018 First Quarter Financial Review\nThe Company reported an increase in net sales of 62.0% to $8.3 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, up from $5.1 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nGross profit was $3.3 million, or 39.4% of net sales, in the 2018 first quarter, as compared to $1.7 million, or 33.7% of net sales, for the same period of 2017. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in sales of Motorola brand cable modems and gateways, which are higher margin products for the Company.\nOperating expenses were $2.9 million, or 34.9% of net sales, in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $2.8 million, or 54.1% of net sales, in the same period of 2017. Selling expenses increased approximately $208,000 to $2.1 million for the 2018 first quarter, primarily due to increases in Motorola trademark royalty costs and in advertising expenses. General and administrative expenses slightly increased for the 2018 first quarter to $448,000 attributable to additional sales tax expense, which was largely offset by decreases in stock compensation expense. Research and development expenses were $410,000 for the 2018 first quarter, compared to $508,000 in the same period of 2017, as a result of decreases in certification expenses and in contracted app development costs.\nZoom reported net income of $359,000, or $0.02 per share, for the 2018 first quarter compared to a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.07 per share, in the same period of 2017. The significant improvement in profitability was due to higher sales, improved gross profit margin, and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAt March 31, 2018, Zoom had $423,000 in cash, $50,000 drawn on a $3.0 million line of credit, working capital of $3.2 million, a current ratio of 1.5, and no long-term debt.\n(in thousands except for percentages) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 % Changed Cash $423 $229 84.6% Total Current Assets $9,212 $8,239 11.8% Total Assets $9,726 $8,793 10.6% Total Current Liabilities $6,009 $5,621 6.9% Working Capital $3,203 $2,618 22.3% Stockholders’ Equity $3,717 $3,172 17.2% Conference Call Details\nDate/Time: Thursday, May 3, 2018 – 5:00 p.m. ET Participant Dial-In Numbers: (United States): 866-393-7958 (International): 706-643-5255 Conference ID 1999214 To access the call, please dial-in approximately five minutes before the start time and, when asked, provide the operator with the conference ID 1999214.
