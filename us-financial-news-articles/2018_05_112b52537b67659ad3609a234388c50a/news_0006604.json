The state owned the nation’s herd and grazing land, with herders paid a wage for working in collective farms. The herd wsa kept at about 25 million in line with land capacity assessments.\nBut that changed after Mongolia became a parliamentary democracy in 1990 and privatization followed, prompting a surge in numbers with the herd hitting 56 million in 2015, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n“Since 1990 everything was chaos ... everyone wanted to have the land ... and animals,” Altantsetseg said.\nSome herders have welcomed the new post-Soviet system.\n“The conditions are fair for everyone. Compared to the previous regime you can work hard to have a better life, you can grow your herd and get a car,” Samdan said.\nBut the dramatic increase in the herd has brought problems of over-grazing exacerbated by desertification, as witnessed by Samdan’s daughter Altantsetseg Jugdur, aged in her 30s.\n“When I was a child ... you couldn’t see the animals in the grass. Now look at what we have. Only dust and soil,” she said.\nHerders’ accounts of climate change are backed by data with a 2014 report from Japan’s Ministry of the Environment stating Mongolia’s annual mean temperature rose by 2.14 percent between 1940 and 2008 with drier weather leading to more dust storms.\nThe report also highlighted an increasing frequency of cold and snow damage from so-called dzuds since the early 1990s - the name for a severe winter that comes after a summer drought.\n“If there is grass beneath the snow then the animals will survive. When there is no grass beneath the snow then it is dzud,” explained herder Altangerel Dolgor.\nDEATH ON THE STEPPE Mongolia’s recent winter killed more than 700,000 livestock left weak after a drought last year, the highest toll since 2011, according to the country’s statistics bureau.\nThe steppe around Tuvshruulekh is littered with animals that have frozen to death. Stray dogs and groups of vultures dot the landscape scavenging the frozen carcasses.\nSamdan said he can read the signs of climate change around him. Lizards are appearing for the first time while some plants are disappearing, including those used in traditional medicines.\n“Before we used to have a leaf which we would boil and drink for stomach problems. Now I can’t find it anymore,” he said.\nBut it is not just the damage to livestock and the land concerning herders but social changes.\nBayarmaa Vanchindorj, deputy director of the National Mental Health Center, said there has been rising numbers of cases of addiction, depression, trafficking and sexual abuse of children.\nThousands of Mongolians protested in front of parliament in Ulaanbaatar in March to demand more action to prevent child abuse after the widely-reported rape of a young boy.\n“Mongolians for many centuries roamed unlimited spaces of their own free will. So I think urbanization took its toll on people’s minds,” she said.\nNarantuya Nijir is one example. She lost all her livestock in a 2010 dzud and now lives in a ger in her landlord’s yard at the edge of Ulaanbaatar where the city meets the open pasture.\n“It’s quite difficult living in someone else’s yard. Even when they don’t give us a hard time we worry a lot,” she said.\nUp the road lives Samdan’s son Chudur with his young family. He has adapted to city life better, having bought a small plot of land where he has just built a small house, in the process learning the skills to start a small double-glazing business.\nBack on the steppe Samdan concedes herding is a tough life but his pleas for young people to stay go unheeded.\nHis 16-year-old grandson Tsendmandakh Altantsetseg has no romantic view of the traditional nomadic life.\n“Nature is changing. The grasslands are turning into deserts. Rivers and streams are disappearing,” he said.\n“I’m planning to go to university in the city after I graduate. I’ll follow my profession, work in the city and build a life there.”\nReporting by Max Baring, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
