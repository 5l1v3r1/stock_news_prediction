Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports\nGame 2 is Tuesday night in Boston.\nCleveland swept the Toronto Raptors and Boston beat the Philadelphia 76ers in five games to set up a rematch of last year’s East finals. James and the Cavaliers eliminated the Celtics in a five-game series last May. Slideshow (5 Images)\nJames has appeared in seven consecutive NBA Finals series, including three straight with Cleveland. Boston is seeking its first Finals berth since 2010, when it lost in seven games to the Los Angeles Lakers.\nBoston shot 51.2 percent (43 of 84) from the field and 36.7 percent (11 of 30) from 3-point range while outrebounding the visitors 48-40. Cleveland was held to 36 percent (31 of 86) from the floor.\nJ.R. Smith’s buzzer-beating jumper had the Cavaliers within 78-64 after three quarters, but a Tatum finger roll put the Boston lead over 20 at 85-64 with 10:52 remaining. Cleveland trailed by as many as 29 after that.\nThe Celtics were up 61-35 at halftime. Brown’s 3-pointer with 32.4 seconds left in the second quarter gave Boston its biggest lead of the half (28) at 61-33. The Cavaliers never came closer than 15 in the period.\nBoston led 36-18 after one quarter after going up by as many as 21, matching the biggest first-quarter deficit James has ever faced in a playoff game. Boston went on a 17-0 run midway through the period.\nCeltics reserve Shane Larkin (left shoulder sprain) did not play. Larkin was already ruled out for Game 2 and is likely to miss the entire series. Boston started Morris in place of Aron Baynes to match up against James.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T02:18:26.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
