Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arrives in Downing Street, in London, May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nJohnson made the comments in parliament on Tuesday in response to a question about whether he thought John Bolton, the U.S. National Security Advisor, was seeking regime change in Tehran.\n“I have to tell you that I do not believe that regime change in Tehran is the objective that we should be seeking,” Johnson said.\n“We might conceivably achieve regime change at some stage in the near future but I cannot with any confidence say that would be a change for the better because it seems equally plausible to me to imagine that Qasem Soleimani of the IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps) could put himself in a very good position to take over from Ayatollah Khamenei for instance.” Reporting by Estelle Shirbon and Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:35:57.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
