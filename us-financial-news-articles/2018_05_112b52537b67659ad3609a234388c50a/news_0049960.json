The emotional reactions and arguments are entirely understandable and that is why it is important that any owner of Wembley Stadium respects its role as the home of English football.”\nClarke said that while Wembley holds a special place in English football, many people regard the “soul” of the English game as being the “clubs, leagues and volunteers”.\nThe FA, Clarke says, has funds in place to repay the remaining debt on Wembley by 2024, after which the organisation would be £3 million pounds a year better off.
