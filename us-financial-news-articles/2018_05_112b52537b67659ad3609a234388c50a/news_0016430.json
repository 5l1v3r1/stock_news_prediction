He does not require surgery and is not expected to recover for at least six weeks,” the team said in a statement.\nMarx, 23, was injured early in his side’s 28-19 away loss to the Wellington Hurricanes last Saturday and will miss the Springboks’ test against Wales in Washington on June 2, as well as the three-match home series against England that will be played on consecutive weekends thereafter.\nHis powerful performances in 2017 for the Springboks and the Johannesburg-based Lions, who were Super Rugby runners-up, led to Marx being named SA Rugby’s Player of the Year.
