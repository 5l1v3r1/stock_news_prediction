As to clarity of whether Wayne is leaving or staying I’ll find out when he comes in for training today.\n“I don’t get involved in transfers or negotiations. All I know is there is interest - where Wayne lies with it I can’t tell you at the moment. If the player wants to leave - if any player does - I’m comfortable with it.\n“But I don’t want to make a headline ‘Sam says Rooney can leave’ - I mean if any player wants to leave he can leave,” Allardyce added.\nAllardyce was also asked about media reports suggesting that Rooney has asked for guarantees over playing time next season should he say at Goodison Park.\nThe former England captain was visibly annoyed at being substituted just after halftime in successive games against Manchester City and Liverpool a few weeks ago.\n“How can anyone be guaranteed playing time next season?” asked Allardyce. “It’s up to the player to put their game together on a consistent basis every week and keep their place in the team.\n“He’s (Rooney’s) had a difficult time since last summer but we’ve all come through that, Wayne included. Wayne is so level-headed. He’s never got carried away and that’s why he’s played so well and achieved so much.”\nAllardyce’s own situation is also uncertain following supporter unrest at recent performances but the 63-year-old showed every intention of staying at the club next season.\n“I have a contract — a one-year contract. Until someone tells me I’m no longer wanted then I have a contract. That’s it. Next season is already planned. It’s done, it’s there,” he said.\n“I think recruitment is the start of the process to try and achieve a top six challenge. The next level of recruitment has to be quality players who get into the team and make them better than they are at this moment in time.” Reporting by Neil Robinson; editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T14:03:30.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
