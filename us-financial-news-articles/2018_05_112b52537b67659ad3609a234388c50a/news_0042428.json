I’m reading the greens well and I’m hitting the ball well.”\nLeishman said there was a big difference in him shooting a four-over 76 in the final round of last week’s Players Championship and his play in Dallas.\n“My speed has been really great,” he told the Golf Channel. “Last week at The Players I hit a lot of really good putts that lipped out, and this week they’re going in.\n“Some weeks you read them really well, and some weeks you’re not sure if a 10-footer is slightly uphill or downhill, and that affects your speed and line and everything.”\nWise, who tied for second in the Wells Fargo Championship two weeks ago, said he used the Australian as an incentive. “I saw Marc Leishman way up there at 15-under and I started the day at six (under) so I knew I had a long ways to go,” Wise told PGA Tour Radio.\n“It was nice when I started getting it going to see his numbers still ahead of me so I could keep chasing and chasing. Even though I was playing tough, I felt like I had to go get him a little bit, which was fun.”\nGay had as many birdies as Leishman on Thursday, 10, but a bogey at the par-four fourth spoiled his chances of equaling Leishman’s round.\nSix of his birdies came on the back nine.\n“My putting has been really down the last month or two, and that’s my strong suit, so I have just been waiting for it to turn around,” Gay admitted.\nHometown favourite Jordan Spieth found improvement with a solid 66 but was still eight strokes off the pace on a low-scoring day.
