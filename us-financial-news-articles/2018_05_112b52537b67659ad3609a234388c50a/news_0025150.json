As a first step it must change its thinking about migration.”\nOrban also said the era of liberal democracy had ended.\n“We have replaced a shipwrecked liberal democracy with a 21st-century Christian democracy, which guarantees people’s freedom, security,” Orban, in power since 2010, told parliament.\n“It supports the traditional family model of one man and one woman, keeps anti-Semitism at bay, and gives a chance for growth,” he added.\nOrban also outlined broad plans for the next 12 years entailing rapid economic and social progress under a conservative ideology.
