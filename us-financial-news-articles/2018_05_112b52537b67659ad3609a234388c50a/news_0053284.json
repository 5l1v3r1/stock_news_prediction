In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox.\nA regulatory filing in April showed Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox's assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion last November - just before Disney's offer was agreed.\nAfter a sale, Fox's remaining assets will include Fox News, Fox Business Network and sports cable networks.\nComcast shares were down 2 percent at $31.83 while Disney was down 0.7 percent at $103.26 in premarket trading.\n\"I think Fox, or its controlling shareholder and Board of Directors, has already expressed their preference - Disney, even though Comcast allegedly offered a higher consideration already,\" said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with JBL Advisors in California.\n\"Comcast does seem intent on winning this one (and) rivalry can frequently drive prices to un-economic levels.\" (Additional reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham and Sriraj Kalluvila)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T01:23:44.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
