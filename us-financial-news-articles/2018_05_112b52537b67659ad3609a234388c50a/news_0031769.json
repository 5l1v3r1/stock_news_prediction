This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to finance the purchases with existing cash balances.\nZynex, Inc. had approximately 33.1 million shares issued and 32.6 million shares outstanding as of May 11, 2018.\nAbout Zynex\nZynex, founded in 1996, markets and sells its own design of electrotherapy medical devices used for pain management and rehabilitation; and the company's proprietary NeuroMove device designed to help recovery of stroke and spinal cord injury patients.
