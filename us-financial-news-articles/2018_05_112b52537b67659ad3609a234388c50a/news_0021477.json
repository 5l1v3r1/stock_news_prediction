Income vs. sales\nNet income\nSales\nbillion\n$3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n–1\n’17\n2016\nLong-term debt\nbillion\n$40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n2016\n’17\nSource: FactSet\nThe company will still keep the names of its businesses, such as Salix for the unit that sells gastrointestinal drugs.\nCanada-based Valeant has been undergoing an overhaul since Mr. Papa took the helm two years ago, after the company faced scrutiny from investors, health insurers and lawmakers over its accounting and business practices, such as buying drugs and then increasing their prices .\nMr. Papa, who has replaced much of management and now leads a largely new board of directors, said the company has paid down about $6.9 billion in debt, hired a comptroller who installed new financial-reporting processes, and limited price increases for branded prescription drugs to less than 10% a year.\nThe company, which was known under the previous regime for spending little on research , plans to increase R&D spending by about 15% this year to $425 million, Mr. Papa said.\nValeant still faces stiff challenges. Its debt surpassed $25 billion at the end of last year. Sales have slowed, partly because the company sold assets to focus the business and to help pay down debt.\nValeant’s market capitalization was $6.3 billion Monday, well below the peak three years ago of $90 billion but about $2.2 billion more than the company’s value before Mr. Papa came aboard.\nMr. Papa said he had been thinking of renaming the company “probably from the first day I joined.” He waited, he said, until the company had made enough progress that investors wouldn’t think the name change was a ploy to mask poor company fundamentals.\nThe Bausch name refers to one of the company’s key and most storied businesses. Bausch & Lomb, founded in 1853 as an optician’s shop in Rochester, N.Y., introduced the first mass-produced soft contact lenses and invented Ray-Ban sunglasses for the military.\nAt Valeant offices in Bridgewater, N.J. The name change will take effect in July and come with a new logo, branding and the ticker BHC on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges. Photo: Dominick Reuter for The Wall Street Journal Valeant bought Bausch & Lomb for $8.7 billion in 2013, and the eye-care business has been one of its best performers. Its products, from contact lenses to eye-surgery equipment, have become more important to the company’s future.\nLast year, the segment comprising Bausch and branded generic drugs sold outside the U.S. notched $4.9 billion of Valeant’s $8.7 billion total revenue.\nMr. Papa said the new name, by referring to health broadly rather than pharmaceuticals in particular, reflects the growing role of non-drug products in the company.\nThe company has been renamed several times. It was founded in 1960 as International Chemical & Nuclear Corp. by a Yugoslav immigrant named Milan Panic, and was known as ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. as the business focused on prescription drugs.\nAfter Mr. Panic was forced out following fights with shareholders and regulators, the company was renamed Valeant in 2003.\nWrite to Jonathan D.
