In that year the Paper Mill in Klucze was established and the company's main manufacturing facility has been located there for over 120 years. The Velvet name, the brand underpinning its paper-based hygiene products, was launched in 1997 on the 100 th anniversary of establishing the company. Today, the Velvet brand has grown to become the leader among paper-based categories and the most popular tissue brand in Poland.\n\"We are delighted that in less than three months from the time of signing the agreement we have been able to complete the acquisition of Velvet CARE successfully. Our approach to this investment reflects our long-term investment strategy of turning Velvet CARE into a leading manufacturer in Central Europe. We are convinced that we will achieve this target in a few years by working hand-in-hand with the highly seasoned management team at Velvet CARE,\" says Paweł Gieryński, Managing Partner of Abris Capital Partners.\nArtur Pielak, CEO of Velvet CARE Sp.
