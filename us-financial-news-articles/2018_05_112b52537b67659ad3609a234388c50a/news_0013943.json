But overall banking revenue fell by a more-than-expected 3.6 percent to 7.57 billion crowns, dragged lower by weaker financial operations income.\nThe bank also said it planned to update its strategy in the coming years to counter pressure on profit margins and growing competition. It will simplify, digitalise and accelerate customer processes in its retail and corporate segments, it said, adding implementation of its KB Change 2020 plan would bring a net positive financial contribution starting from 2019.
