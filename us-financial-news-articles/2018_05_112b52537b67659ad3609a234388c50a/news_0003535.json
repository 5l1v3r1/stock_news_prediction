We are pursuing multiple large opportunities that should close in the second half of the year.”\n“Service margins improved in the first quarter of 2018 to 59.1% from 57.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, helped by a 3.3% sequential increase in higher-margin Recurring Service Revenues of $1.2 million, while less profitable Other Service Revenues decreased $2.5 million as several large deployments are nearing completion,” said Robert Costantini, Chief Financial Officer of ORBCOMM. “Product margins also improved in the first quarter to 21.6% from 12.7%. This trend of improving margins for both Service Revenues and Product Sales is expected to continue in 2018.”\nRecent Highlights:\nFinancial Highlights\nFor Q1 of 2018, Total Revenues were $68.0 million, up 31% year-over-year. Service Revenues of $38.0 million were up 29%, and Product Sales rose 34% to $30.0 million. First Quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $10.1 million, representing 14.9% of Total Revenues, was $2.3 million lower than the same period last year. The decline was the result of higher operating costs, mostly from the acquisitions in the second half of 2017 as well as completing the large deployments. Net subscriber communicator additions for ORBCOMM were over 100,000 in Q1 of 2018, increasing the total billable subscriber communicators to 2,126,000 at March 31, 2018, which compares to 1,766,000 at the end of March last year; a 20.4% increase year-over-year.\nBusiness Highlights\nOn February 28, 2018, ORBCOMM announced that it had been selected by Armstrong Transportation to provide its industry-leading logistics tracking and monitoring solution for their trailer fleet.

Common Stockholders was ($10.1) million 2018, compared to the Net Loss of ($3.3) million in the first quarter of 2017.

To facilitate external analysis of the Company’s operating performance, ORBCOMM also presents financial information that are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under Regulation G and related reporting requirements promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, Net Income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different than those presented by other companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and are therefore considered non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation table is presented above.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings attributable to ORBCOMM Inc. before interest income (expense), loss on debt extinguishment, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. ORBCOMM believes EBITDA is useful to its management and investors in evaluating operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used to evaluate the economic productivity of the Company’s operations, including its ability to obtain and maintain its customers, its ability to operate its business effectively, the efficiency of its employees and the profitability associated with their performance. It also helps ORBCOMM’s management and investors to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period on a consistent basis by removing the impact of its financing transactions and the depreciation and amortization impact of capital investments from its operating results. In addition, ORBCOMM management uses EBITDA in presentations to its board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the annual operating budget.\nThe Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, noncontrolling interests, impairment loss, and acquisition-related and integration costs, is useful to investors to evaluate the Company’s core operating results and financial performance because it excludes items that are significant non-cash or non-recurring expenses reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin equals Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenues.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005469/en/\nInvestor Inquiries:\nORBCOMM Inc.\nAly Bonilla, 703-433-6360\nVice President, Investor Relations\nbonilla.aly@orbcomm.com\nor\nFinancial and Trade Media:\nThe Abernathy MacGregor Group\nAlan Oshiki, 212-371-5999\nExecutive Vice President\naho@abmac.com\nSource: ORBCOMM Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orbcomm.com%2F&esheet=51800362&newsitemid=20180503005469&lan=en-US&anchor=www.orbcomm.com&index=6&md5=65893d54557d9665b722d784eaabe536", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orbcomm.com&esheet=51800362&newsitemid=20180503005469&lan=en-US&anchor=www.orbcomm.com&index=3&md5=a0588a010222aea2a96048d6f8bc725c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orbcomm.com%2Fen%2Findustries%2Ftransportation-and-distribution&esheet=51800362&newsitemid=20180503005469&lan=en-US&anchor=fleet+management&index=2&md5=d4b5f8e54b792f067ca5d29dd70b4203", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.webcasts.com%2Fstarthere.jsp%3Fei%3D1188461%26tp_key%3D0bfbf2c301&esheet=51800362&newsitemid=20180503005469&lan=en-US&anchor=Click+Here&index=5&md5=6f5fffd8a5129e454412e1938b9d6ba9", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005469/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orbcomm.com%2Fen%2Fsolutions%2Fweb-applications%2Fcargowatch&esheet=51800362&newsitemid=20180503005469&lan=en-US&anchor=tracking+and+monitoring+solution&index=1&md5=639d8c1b0445e6a90866d72c40744f2e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.orbcomm.com&esheet=51800362&newsitemid=20180503005469&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.orbcomm.com&index=4&md5=c35d744f97f52b8a89ee2005b1070610"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:37:09.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
