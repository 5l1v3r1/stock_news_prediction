For 10-year futures, open interest fell by around 137,000 as trading volume in the benchmark contract hit a record.\n“Some people were short coming in and then they flipped,” Greg Adamsick, director of global futures and options at RCM Alternatives in Chicago, said on Wednesday.\nLast week, hedge funds’ net short positions in 10-year Treasury notes fell to the lowest level in nearly two months, while bond dealers raised net shorts in 10-year T-notes to the highest since February 2016.\n“One would have to think a lot of short positions, especially weak ones, had to capitulate,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed income at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.\nLess than two weeks ago, the 10-year Treasury yield broke above 3.10 percent to its highest levels in nearly seven years on expectations of rising inflation and federal borrowing.\nBut since then, bond yields have begun retreating on worries about the renewed trade tension between China and the United States; cancellation of a nuclear summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Turkey’s economic policies under President Tayyip Erdogan.\nSome analysts also reckoned Treasuries were simply oversold.\nAlthough bond bears regained some footing as the market gave back some of Tuesday’s dramatic gains, yields remained well below their seven-year high.\nOn Wednesday, the 10-year yield rose to 2.855 percent as Italian politicians scrambled for a deal to form a government, reducing some safe-haven bond holdings from the day before. The 10-year yield had fallen to 2.759 percent on Tuesday, which was the lowest since April 11, according to Reuters data.\nThe boon for U.S. Treasury securities on Tuesday resulted in a 0.952 percent total return on the day, the biggest one-day gain since July 29, 2011, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays.\nThe reversal in market sentiment was captured by a closely followed survey from J.P. Morgan.\nIt showed that the share of J.P. Morgan’s Treasury customers who are holding fewer longer-dated government issues than their benchmarks was equal to the share of customers who are holding more longer-dated bonds than their benchmarks on Tuesday.\nThis was the least bearish their clients were on Treasuries since April 2017.\nIn the short-term term, bearish bond bets remain vulnerable to political developments in Europe as Italy seeks to form a government and a possible no-confidence vote of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday.\n“I hardly think we are out of the woods,” D.A. Davidson’s Hurley said.\nReporting by Richard Leong; editing by Diane Craft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
