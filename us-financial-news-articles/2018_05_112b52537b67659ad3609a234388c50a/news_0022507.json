The financial information presented in this news release was derived from the Q1 2018 Financial Statements (as defined below).\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Subsequent Financial Highlights\nRevenues – Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 23.8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, revenues for the quarter would have increased by approximately 12.4%. Real-money online poker revenues and real-money online casino and sportsbook combined revenues represented approximately 62.6% and 34.2% of revenues for the quarter, respectively. Poker Revenues – Real-money online poker revenues for the quarter were $245.9 million, or an increase of approximately 12.4% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, real-money online poker revenues would have increased by approximately 2.3% for the quarter. The increase in poker revenue was primarily driven by the positive impact of the Stars Rewards loyalty program, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the introduction of shared poker liquidity in France and Spain, as offset by, among other things, the cessation of operations or difficult operating conditions in certain markets including Australia and Colombia. Casino & Sportsbook Revenues – Real-money online casino and sportsbook combined revenues for the quarter were $134.5 million, or an increase of approximately 55.0% year-over-year. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, 20.7% of the combined casino and sportsbook revenues related to sportsbook revenues. Excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, real-money online casino and sportsbook combined revenues would have increased by approximately 39.3% for the quarter. The increase in casino and sportsbook combined revenue was primarily driven by continued improvements in The Stars Group's casino and sportsbook product offerings, positive impacts of foreign exchange fluctuations, and the addition of revenue related to the acquisition of a majority of the equity interests in CrownBet. Debt and Cash – Total long-term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.45 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. As previously disclosed, on April 6, 2018, The Stars Group successfully increased the size, repriced at lower interest rates and extended the maturity on its U.S. dollar and Euro denominated first lien term loans and revolving credit facility, amended and restated the applicable credit agreement, and fully repaid the remaining $95 million outstanding on its second lien term loan. The Stars Group ended the first quarter of 2018 with approximately $257 million in operational cash on its balance sheet.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Subsequent Operational Highlights\nQuarterly Real-Money Active Uniques (QAUs) – Total QAUs were approximately 2.24 million, a decrease of approximately 4.6% year-over-year primarily led by The Stars Group's strategy of focusing on positive return customer relationship management initiatives to attract high-value, net-depositing customers (primarily recreational players) and the cessation of operations or difficult operating conditions in certain markets including Australia and Colombia. Approximately 2.09 million of such QAUs played online poker during the quarter, a decrease of approximately 5.5% year-over-year, while The Stars Group's online casino offerings had approximately 621,800 QAUs, a decrease of 2.4% year-over-year, which The Stars Group continues to estimate as one of the largest active casino player bases among its competitors. The Stars Group's emerging online sportsbook offerings had approximately 335,800 QAUs, a 16.3% increase year-over-year. Quarterly Net Yield (QNY) – Total QNY was $165, an increase of 26.7% year-over-year, and QNY excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates was $155, an increase of 18.7% year-over-year. QNY is a non-IFRS measure. Net Deposits – Net Deposits were $353.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 25.9% year-over-year. Net Deposits are closely correlated to The Stars Group's reported net gaming revenue as some or all of the deposits eventually become revenue. The Stars Group believes that the increase in Net Deposits was primarily driven by the implementation of the Stars Rewards loyalty program and continued focus on high-value customers (primarily recreational players), positive impacts from foreign exchange fluctuations and continued development of the casino and sportsbook product offerings. Customer Registrations – Customer Registrations increased by 2.3 million during the quarter. CrownBet and William Hill Australia – On February 27, 2018, The Stars Group acquired a 62% equity interest in CrownBet Holdings Pty Limited, an Australian-based online sportsbook, from Crown Resorts Limited and then on April 24, 2018, The Stars Group increased its equity interest in CrownBet to 80%, and CrownBet completed the acquisition of William Hill Australia Holdings Pty Ltd. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was $435 million (inclusive of $117.7 million to acquire the 62% equity interest in CrownBet), which was paid in a combination of cash and the issuance of approximately 3.1 million newly-issued common shares of The Stars Group. Sky Betting & Gaming – On April 21, 2018, The Stars Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Sky Betting & Gaming, one of the United Kingdom's leading online sportsbooks and gaming providers. The aggregate purchase price was $4.7 billion, of which $3.6 billion will be payable in cash and the remainder will be payable through the issuance of approximately 37.9 million newly-issued common shares. Completion of the transaction is conditional upon obtaining customary approvals from the Toronto Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and certain gaming and other regulatory authorities, in addition to the completion of other customary closing conditions. To finance the cash portion of the purchase price for the transaction, The Stars Group obtained fully committed debt financing of $6.9 billion, including $5.1 billion of first lien term loans, $1.4 billion of senior unsecured notes and a $400 million revolving credit facility. The funded proceeds of $6.5 billion will be used for the cash portion of the transaction consideration, refinancing The Stars Group's existing first lien term loans and repaying Sky Betting & Gaming's outstanding debt.\n2018 Full Year Guidance\nFull Year Guidance – The Stars Group intends to provide revised 2018 full year financial guidance to include its acquisitions of Crown Bet, William Hill Australia and Sky Betting & Gaming when it releases its financial results for the second quarter in August. The Stars Group continues to be satisfied with the performance of its existing operations and as of the date hereof continues to expect the following 2018 full year financial guidance ranges: Revenues of between $1,390 and $1,470 million; Adjusted EBITDA of between $625 and $650 million; Adjusted Net Earnings of between $487 and $512 million; and Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share of between $2.33 and $2.47.\nThese unaudited expected results reflect The Stars Group's existing business, excluding CrownBet, William Hill Australia and Sky Betting & Gaming. These expectations also reflect management's view of current and future market and business conditions, including assumptions of (i) potential negative operating conditions in Russia expected to begin in late-May 2018, (ii) no other material regulatory events, and (iii) no material foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly against the Euro. Such guidance is also based on a Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.20 to 1.00, Diluted Shares of between 207,000,000 and 209,000,000 for the high and low ends of the Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share range, respectively, and certain accounting assumptions.\nFinancial Statements, Management's Discussion and Analysis and Additional Information\nThe Stars Group's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (the \"Q1 2018 Financial Statements\"), management's discussion and analysis thereon (the \"Q1 2018 MD&A\"), as well as additional information relating to The Stars Group and its business, can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com , Edgar at www.sec.gov and The Stars Group's website at www.starsgroup.com .\nIn addition to press releases, securities filings and public conference calls and webcasts, The Stars Group intends to use its investor relations page on its website as a means of disclosing material information to its investors and others and for complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable securities laws.

Investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on or information. Any forward-looking statement or information speaks only as of the date hereof, and The Stars Group undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nNon-IFRS and Non-U.S. GAAP Measures\nThis news release references non-IFRS and non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including QNY, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations, Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share, and the foreign exchange impact on revenues (i.e., constant currency). The Stars Group believes these non-IFRS and non-U.S. GAAP financial measures will provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of its business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating its business. Although management believes these financial measures are important in evaluating The Stars Group, they are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP. They are not recognized measures under IFRS or U.S. GAAP and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS or U.S. GAAP. These measures may be different from non-IFRS and non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of certain of these measures is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of the adjustments thereto provided herein have an actual effect on The Stars Group's operating results. In addition to QNY, which is defined below under \"Key Metrics and Other Data\", The Stars Group uses the following non-IFRS and non-U.S. GAAP measures in this news release:\nAdjusted EBITDA means net earnings before financial expenses, income taxes expense (recovery), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring and certain other items.\nAdjusted Cash Flow from Operations means net cash inflows from operating activities after adding back customer deposit liability movements.\nAdjusted Net Earnings means net earnings before interest accretion, amortization of intangible assets resulting from purchase price allocation following acquisitions, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, restructuring, foreign exchange, and certain other items.\nAdjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share means Adjusted Net Earnings divided by Diluted Shares. Diluted Shares means the weighted average number of common shares on a fully diluted basis, including options, other equity-based awards, warrants and convertible preferred shares. The effects of anti-dilutive potential common shares are ignored in calculating Diluted Shares. See note 7 to the Q1 2018 Financial Statements. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, Diluted Shares equaled 209,495,673 and 200,656,549, respectively. For the purposes of the full year 2018 financial guidance provided in this news release, Diluted Shares equals between 207,000,000 and 209,000,000 for the high and low ends of the Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share range, respectively.\nTo calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, The Stars Group translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for its local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which The Stars Group believes is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to its historical performance.\nFor additional information on The Stars Group's non-IFRS measures, see the Q1 2018 MD&A, including under the headings \"Management's Discussion and Analysis\" and \"Selected Financial Information—Other Financial Information\".\nKey Metrics and Other Data\nThe Stars Group defines QAUs as active unique customers (online, mobile and desktop client) who (i) made a deposit or transferred funds into their real-money account with The Stars Group at any time, and (ii) generated real-money rake or placed a real-money bet or wager on or through one of its real-money online poker, casino or sportsbook offerings during the applicable quarterly period. The Stars Group defines unique as a customer who played at least once on one of its real-money offerings during the period, and excludes duplicate counting, even if that customer is active across multiple verticals (poker, casino and/or sportsbook). The definition of QAUs excludes customer activity from certain low-stakes, non-raked real-money poker games, but includes real-money activity by customers using funds (cash and cash equivalents) deposited by The Stars Group into such customers' previously funded accounts as promotions to increase their lifetime value.\nThe Stars Group defines QNY as combined real-money online gaming and related revenue (excluding certain other revenues, such as revenues that are included in \"other gaming\" revenues) for its two business lines (i.e., real-money online poker and real-money online casino and sportsbook) as reported during the applicable quarterly period (or as adjusted to the extent any accounting reallocations are made in later periods) divided by the total QAUs during the same period. The Stars Group provides QNY on a U.S. dollar and constant currency basis. QNY is a non-IFRS measure.\nThe Stars Group defines Net Deposits as the aggregate of gross deposits or transfer of funds made by customers into their real-money online accounts less withdrawals or transfer of funds by such customers from such accounts, in each case during the applicable quarterly period. Gross deposits exclude (i) any deposits, transfers or other payments made by such customers into The Stars Group's play-money and social gaming offerings, and (ii) any real-money funds (cash and cash equivalents) deposited by The Stars Group into such customers' previously funded accounts as promotions to increase their lifetime value.\nThe Stars Group defines Customer Registrations as the cumulative number of online real-money and play-money customer registrations on The Stars Group's brands.\nTo ensure consistency in The Stars Group's key metrics for the three months ended March 31, 2018 presented in this news release, The Stars Group has excluded all QAUs, Net Deposits and Customer Registrations related to CrownBet and has excluded CrownBet revenues from QNY. The Stars Group will continue to review and analyze applicable data and information available to it and will consider including key metrics from CrownBet in its own key metrics, including QAUs, QNY, Net Deposits and Customer Registrations, once it has had sufficient time to evaluate, confirm and record the same.\nFor additional information on The Stars Group's key metrics and other data, see the Q1 2018 MD&A, including under the headings \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" and \"Key Metrics\".\nTHE STARS GROUP INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nU.S. dollars\n2018\n$000 ' s\n(except per share amounts)\n2017\n$000 ' s\n(except per share amounts)\nRevenues\n392,891\n317,320\nExpenses\nSelling\n61,297\n43,051\nGeneral and administrative\n161,395\n131,141\nFinancial\n45,015\n40,589\nGaming duty\n42,952\n34,533\nAcquisition-related costs\n7,739\n—\nTotal expenses\n318,398\n249,314\nGain from investments\n1,023\n435\nNet earnings before income taxes\n75,516\n68,441\nIncome taxes\n1,155\n2,688\nNet earnings\n74,361\n65,753\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to\nShareholders of The Stars Group Inc.\n75,451\n65,411\nNon-controlling interest\n(1,090)\n342\nNet earnings\n74,361\n65,753\nBasic earnings per Common Share\n$\n0.51\n$\n0.45\nDiluted earnings per Common Share\n$\n0.36\n$\n0.33\nTHE STARS GROUP INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at March 31,\nAs at December 31,\n2018\n2017\nU.S. dollars\n$000 ' s\n$000 ' s\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents -
