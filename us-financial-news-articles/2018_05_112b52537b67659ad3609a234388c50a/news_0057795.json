We would be very happy to see you,” Lavrov, seated across a table from Kim, said during a televised meeting.

KCNA/via REUTERS\nKim’s personal meeting with Lavrov was likely a move to try to secure Russia - along with China - as another powerful player that can push the United States to ease sanctions and make other concessions, said Anthony Rinna, a specialist in Korea-Russia relations at Sino-NK, a website that analyzes the region.\nIn the short term, Moscow “cannot afford to be remembered as the country that had no hat in the ring leading up to June 12,” he said.\n“From a longer-term perspective, Russia hopes to foster economic cooperation with both North and South Korea.”\nKim would be wise to delay any official visit to Russia until after his meeting with Trump, said Jeong Hyung-gon, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.\n“It won’t be easy for Kim Jong Un to turn down an official invitation, so I think it would be after the June 12 summit, which would help him to hold a successful summit with the U.S.” Slideshow (5 Images)\nLavrov also held talks with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, Russian news agencies said.
