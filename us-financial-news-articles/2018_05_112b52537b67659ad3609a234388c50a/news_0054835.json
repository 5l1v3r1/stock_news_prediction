Last year, the cosmetics giant used the technology to create more than 15,000 prototypes.\nHowever, Hamilton said that trialing products on social media goes beyond simply providing a cheap fix for cash-strapped start-ups. It also give an insight into customer demands that goes beyond traditional methods.\n\"Ultimately, you want to know that the product is going to sell,\" noted Hamilton. \"Big corporates can invest a lot of money in focus groups and things. But if you don't have the money, you can go to social media and get real feedback — and it's also more likely to be genuine feedback.\"\nHaving that direct line of communication with consumers has also made it easier for entrepreneurs to identify new opportunities, according to Hamilton.\nSupernova Beauty brands including SkinnyMint, Sand & Sky and Coco & Eve are showcased in Supernova's Singapore HQ \"There's a huge market for product discovery these days, so we're creating niche brands that really appeal to the consumer,\" she said. \"Social media gives you that opportunity to see what other people are saying.\"\nHamilton is not alone in using social media for inspiration.
