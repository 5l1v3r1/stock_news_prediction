The Company recognized $1.3 million in contract revenue – related party, $29,000 in government contract revenue and $129,000 in government grant revenue for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $1.6 million in contract revenue – related party, $39,000 in government contract revenue and $31,000 in government grant revenue for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.3 million, compared with total operating expenses of $4.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in expenses was related to the FDA Advisory Committee Meeting. General and administrative costs were unchanged. Research and development expenses increased $800,000. In the first quarter of 2018, our research and development expenses were higher due to higher consulting costs related to the FDA meeting and the submission fees for our MAA application as well as severance expenses. This increase in expenses was offset by lower costs for clinical expense and lower employee related expenses due to a reduction in headcount. The receipt of a tax incentive in Australia offset a portion of the research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.8 million or $0.32 per share, compared with a net loss of $3.7 million or $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net loss resulted primarily from an increase in operating expenses of $800,000 related to the FDA meeting in January and the submission of the MAA to EMA in March for approval of Linhaliq. A decrease in revenue of $200,000 and an increase in interest expense of $100,000 related to the convertible notes was recorded.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources and Related Matters\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4 million.\nIn January, Aradigm received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for Linhaliq as a treatment for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) patients with chronic lung infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).\nThe CRL states that the FDA has determined that it cannot approve the NDA in its present form and provides specific reasons for this action along with recommendations needed for resubmission; the areas of concern include clinical data, human factor validation study and product quality.\nThe Aradigm Board of Directors approved temporary measures on February 9, 2018 intended to preserve the Company’s cash resources.\nIn April Aradigm raised $2.0 million through the issuance of bridge notes and obtained commitments for additional monthly funding through September of 2018 totaling $5 million. This $7.0 million along with the cash balance of $1.4 million will be sufficient to fund operations through the third quarter of 2018.\nAradigm is pursuing potential alternatives to resolve our cash position in the short term as well as developing strategic options that would provide for our long term viability. We feel it is very important to bring Linhaliq to commercialization in as many geographies as possible to allow patients suffering from non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) to receive the benefits of Linhaliq. Patients, patient advocacy groups and key opinion leaders have expressed support as we work towards this goal. The MAA was filed in early March and validated for review in late March and that is the first step in achieving regulatory approval in Europe.\nAbout Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis\nNCFBE is a severe, chronic and rare disease characterized by abnormal dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles, frequently associated with chronic lung infections. It is often a consequence of a vicious cycle of inflammation, recurrent lung infections, and bronchial wall damage. NCFBE represents an unmet medical need with high morbidity and mortality that affects more than 150,000 people in the U.S. and over 200,000 people in Europe. There is currently no drug approved for the treatment of this condition.\nAbout Aradigm\nAradigm is an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of drugs for the prevention and treatment of severe respiratory diseases. Aradigm has completed two Phase 3 trials with Linhaliq, an investigational proprietary formulation of ciprofloxacin for inhalation for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis BE and submitted an NDA to the FDA for this indication. Aradigm’s inhaled ciprofloxacin formulations include Linhaliq and Lipoquin which are also product candidates for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and for the prevention and treatment of high threat and bioterrorism infections, such as inhaled tularemia, pneumonic plague, melioidosis, Q fever and inhaled anthrax.\nMore information about Aradigm can be found at www.aradigm.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, this news release contains that involve risk and uncertainties, including the risk that Linhaliq may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized, as well as the other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC on March 23, 2018, and the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nAradigm and the Aradigm Logo are registered trademarks of Aradigm Corporation.
