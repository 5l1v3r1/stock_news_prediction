Thirty-six people died there as the wind speed reached 80 miles an hour, said Relief Commissioner Sanjay Kumar of Uttar Pradesh state.\nThe monument wasn’t damaged.\nThe Press Trust of India news agency said at least 27 others died and that an additional 100 were injured in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. Most of the deaths were caused by house collapses and lightning.\nThe rainstorm caught people by surprise, as the monsoon season is still more than six weeks away.\nUprooted trees flattened mud huts of the poor, Sanjay Kumar said. Electricity supply and telephone lines were snapped in parts of Uttar Pradesh state, Mr. Kumar said.\n—Copyright 2018 the Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T13:56:57.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
