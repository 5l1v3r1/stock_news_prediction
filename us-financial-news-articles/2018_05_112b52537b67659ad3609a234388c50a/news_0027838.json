The Italian unit of broadcaster Sky had challenged the terms of the tender.\nThe tender had already been suspended in mid-April after Sky Italia requested the court to verify whether the sale respected Italian regulation.\nMediapro said it had analysed the judge’s decision and believed its tender was in line with Italian regulations and with the contract it had signed with Italy’s soccer league.
