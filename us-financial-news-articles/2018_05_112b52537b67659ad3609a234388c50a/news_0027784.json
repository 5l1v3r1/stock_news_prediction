This means tax brackets are not adjusted for inflation.\nUnlike in many other major economies such as the United States, Britain and France, thresholds in Germany’s progressive tax system are not automatically adjusted. The OECD has urged Germany and others to introduce index-linked tax brackets.\nSPENDING SQUEEZE Scholz said that any further fiscal room in the future would be used to finance the projects agreed in the coalition deal, such as increasing defense spending and development aid.\nLast week Scholz presented spending plans that envisage public investment falling from 2020 and advised ministries seeking more funds to live within their means.[L8N1SG6QU]\nGermany’s defense and development ministries have already objected to Scholz’s budget plans, saying they violate the coalition pact between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and their junior partner, the Social Democrats (SPD).\nDefence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and Development Minister Gerd Mueller - both conservatives - have met Merkel to demand more funds for their ministries.\nThey said the budget plans submitted by Scholz flouted pledges to ensure that Germany’s development aid and defense spending as a percentage of economic output did not shrink in the coming years.\nThe lack of a more pronounced increase in military spending has drawn the ire of U.S. officials, who have been pressing Germany to move more rapidly toward a NATO target of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense.\nGermany has had a “debt brake” law in place since 2011 that forces the federal and state governments to virtually eliminate any budget deficits by 2020. This means any spending must be financed by additional tax revenues or cuts in other areas.\nThe German economy has been enjoying an unusually prolonged upswing since 2010 and the federal government has kept a balanced budget since 2014.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Madeline Chambers and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:26:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
