(NYSE American: SYN), a late-stage clinical company developing therapeutics that preserve the microbiome to protect and restore the health of patients, today provided an operational update and reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n\"During the first quarter, we held several collaborative and productive meetings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have reached preliminary agreement on a clinical trial synopsis for our planned Phase 3 clinical program for ribaxamase, our first-in-class therapeutic intervention designed to prevent the onset of primary C. difficile infection (CDI) by protecting the gut microbiome from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis,\" stated Steven A. Shallcross, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\"The establishment of key components of our planned Phase 3 clinical trial, including the important distinction of evaluating efficacy and safety as separate, co-primary endpoints, is a significant milestone in ribaxamase's clinical development. Looking ahead, we plan to continue to work closely with the FDA to define the remaining elements of our trial protocol and intend to share these outcomes following the completion of our End-of-Phase 2 meeting, expected during the second half of 2018. Antibiotic exposure is the major risk factor for CDI, and there are more than 450,000 cases of CDI each year in the U.S. If approved, ribaxamase will be the first intervention specifically designed to prevent CDI associated with the most commonly used IV antibiotics,\" concluded Shallcross.\nClinical Development and Operational Update\nThe proposed Phase 3 clinical trial synopsis for SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is expected to include two separate and decoupled co-primary endpoints designed to evaluate efficacy and safety in a patient population being treated with a representative selection of intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics, and is expected to: Comprise a global, event driven clinical trial with a fixed maximum number of patients for total enrollment Evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of ribaxamase in a broader patient population by the inclusion of additional IV beta-lactam antibiotics in addition to ceftriaxone and by enrolling patients with a variety of underlying infections Evaluate the ability of ribaxamase to reduce the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in the ribaxamase treatment group compared to placebo as the primary efficacy endpoint Evaluate mortality risk as the co-primary safety endpoint which will be separate from the primary efficacy endpoint of reduction in the incidence of CDI Anticipate End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2H 2018 to solidify the remaining elements of the planned SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Phase 3 clinical trial; Plan to initiate SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Phase 3 clinical trial in 2H 2019; Issued U.S. Patent No. 9,956,292 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USTPO), which includes claims related to composition of matter for the use of anti-methanogenic compositions to treat IBS-C and expires no later than 2035, providing key intellectual property protection in the U.S. for SYN-010; and Continue efforts to solidify clinical infrastructure, including exploring international regulatory and market access structures to support advancement of SYN-010, designed to treat an underlying cause of the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 Financial Results\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease is primarily the result of lower salary expense, stock compensation, and related benefits costs incurred in 2018 due to the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer, along with the reduction of travel, consulting fees, and legal expenses in 2018 offset by higher registration fees. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $349,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $698,000 for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses decreased to $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.1 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease is primarily the result of lower SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-010 program costs for 2018 since no clinical trials were ongoing during the quarter. The research and development costs incurred during the quarter were primarily related to planning for future Phase 3 (SYN-004) and Phase 2b/3 (SYN-010) clinical programs as we seek to secure the financial resources necessary for the completion of these clinical trials. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $326,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $437,000 for the same period in 2017.\nOther income was $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to other income of $5.1 million for the same period in 2017. Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily comprised of non-cash income of $2.7 million from the change in fair value of warrants. The decrease in the fair value of the warrants was due to the decrease in our stock price from the prior quarter.\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 was $11.0 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nSynthetic Biologics will hold a conference call today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. (EDT).

(NYSE American: SYN) is a late-stage clinical company developing therapeutics that preserve the microbiome to protect and restore the health of patients. The Company's lead candidates poised for Phase 3 development are: (1) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to protect the gut microbiome from the effects of certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics for the prevention of C. difficile infection (CDI), overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and (2) SYN-010 which is intended to reduce the impact of methane producing organisms in the gut microbiome to treat an underlying cause of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). The Company's preclinical pursuits include an oral formulation of the enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) to treat both local GI and systemic diseases as well as monoclonal antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of pertussis, and novel discovery stage biotherapeutics for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU).
