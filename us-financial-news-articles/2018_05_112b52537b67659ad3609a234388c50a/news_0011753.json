REUTERS/Darren Staples The new funds will amount to about 22 billion euros (19.4 billion pounds) per year for the 2021-27 period, or about 12 percent of the total EU budget revenue.\nThe Commission wants a 3 percent common consolidated corporate tax base to harmonise national rules on tax deductions, including for digital services companies. It said this could add 12 billion euros per year to the budget.\nIt also proposed that member states contribute 20 percent share of revenues from national emission trading system auctions to be worth 3 billion euros a year to the EU budget.\nEU governments should also contribute 80 cents per kilogram of non-recycled plastic packaging waste for a total amount estimated at 7 billion euros for the budget.\nReporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar; Editing by Foo Yun Chee\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:10:17.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
