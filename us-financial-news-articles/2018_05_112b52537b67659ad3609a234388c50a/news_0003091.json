For the first quarter of 2017, the Company reported operating income of $1.8 million on revenue of $22.0 million.\n“Our first quarter results demonstrate the leveraged earnings power of our business model and the diversity of new revenue opportunities we have been cultivating,” said Michael D. Popielec, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Total Company government/defense sales grew 6% driven by strong Communications Systems shipments and total Company commercial sales grew 3% driven by higher medical sales. On the strength of 5% revenue growth, solid gross margins and disciplined expense control, operating profit grew 28% generating a 10.2% operating margin. A strong start to the year, backlog, and strict adherence to our business model parameters give us confidence that we will deliver another year of profitable growth.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue was $23.1 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 4.7%, compared to $22.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 reflecting higher medical and government/defense sales. Battery & Energy Products sales decreased $.3 million, or 1.5%, to $17.2 million compared to $17.5 million last year due primarily to timing differences in government/defense shipments, not fully offset by an 18.9% increase in medical sales. Communications Systems grew 28.3% to $5.8 million compared to $4.6 million for the same period last year reflecting shipments of our Vehicle Amplifier Adapters for the U.S. Army’s Special Force Assistance Brigades under a contract awarded in December 2017, power supplies shipments to a large global defense prime contractor, as well as a 49% year-over-year increase in shipments of core products such as our 20-watt amplifiers and universal vehicle adapters.\nGross profit was $7.3 million, or 31.6% of revenue, compared to $6.9 million, or 31.3% of revenue, for the same quarter a year ago. Battery & Energy Products’ gross margin was 29.2%, compared to 28.2% last year, and Communications Systems’ gross margin was 38.4%, compared to 43.0% last year, primarily due to product mix.\nOperating expenses were $4.9 million compared to $5.0 million last year reflecting continued tight control over discretionary spending. Operating expenses were 21.4% of revenue compared to 22.9% of revenue for the year-earlier period.\nOperating income was $2.4 million compared to $1.8 million last year for an operating margin of 10.2% compared to 8.4% last year.\nNet income was $2.2 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to net income of $1.7 million, or $0.11 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAbout Ultralife Corporation\nUltralife Corporation serves its markets with products and services ranging from power solutions to communications and electronics systems.
