Please see “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Glossary of Terms” and “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” below for an explanation of non-GAAP measures used throughout this release.\nHurricane Impact\nIn September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria affected several Vistana and HVO resorts and sales centers, as well as nearly 300 properties within the Interval Network or managed by VRI or Aqua-Aston Hospitality. At March 31, 2018 our Westin St. John Resort Villas in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hyatt Residence Club Dorado, Hacienda del Mar, in Puerto Rico were closed and expected to reopen early in 2019. Approximately 50 Interval Network properties on the hardest-hit islands were also closed at quarter end. However, a number of them are expected to reopen in the second quarter.\nFirst quarter consolidated operating results\nConsolidated revenue was $482 million, and excluding the estimated hurricane impact, it would have been $501 million, up 13% over the prior year driven by strong performance in our vacation ownership segment.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $43 million. Excluding the estimated impact of the hurricanes it would have been $48 million, up 9% compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.34, compared to $0.35.\nAdjusted net income was $46 million, compared to $42 million in 2017. Excluding the estimated impact from the hurricane, it would have been $50 million, up 19% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.36. Excluding the impact from the hurricane it would have been $0.39, higher by 18%.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $98 million. Excluding the impact from the hurricane, it would have been $104 million, an increase of 13% compared to 2017.\nBusiness segment results\nVacation Ownership\nExcluding cost reimbursements, Vacation Ownership segment revenue increased $53 million, to $267 million principally as a result of the following:\n$27 million increase in management fee and other revenue predominantly attributable to revenue from the consolidation of our HOAs starting in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase is largely offset by a corresponding decrease in cost reimbursement revenue. $18 million increase in sales of vacation ownership products principally attributable to higher consolidated contract sales largely due to an 11% increase in tour flow. $5 million increase in resort operations revenue primarily driven by higher available and occupied room nights and average daily rate resulting from the increase in the number of units which came on-line beginning in the second quarter of 2017.\nVacation Ownership segment operating income increased 6% to $17 million and adjusted EBITDA was higher by $3 million to $36 million driven primarily from higher VO sales and stronger performance in our resort operations. Excluding the impact of the hurricanes, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA would have been $8 million to $41 million, 24% higher than 2017.\nExchange and Rental\nExchange and Rental segment revenue was $171 million dollars, relatively consistent with 2017. Excluding cost reimbursements, segment revenue was up 3% to $150 million dollars related to stronger club rental revenue resulting from the above- mentioned increase in available and occupied room nights and average daily rate.\nTotal Interval Network active members at quarter-end were 1.8 million, consistent with 2017, and average revenue per member was $53.17, up 2%.\nOperating income for the segment was $49 million, up 4%. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 5% to $62 million dollars primarily driven by the stronger club rental activity. Excluding the estimated hurricane impact, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA would have been 7%.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, ILG's cash and cash equivalents totaled $158 million, compared to $122 million on December 31, 2017, and we had $204 million of eligible unsecuritized receivables.\nThe principal amount outstanding of long term corporate debt as of March 31, 2018 was $570 million consisting of $350 million 5 5/8% Senior Notes and $220 million drawn under our revolving credit facility.\nILG had $366 million available on its revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit as of March 31, 2018.\nNet cash and restricted cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2018 was $152 million compared to $58 million. The $94 million increase was principally due higher net cash receipts partly attributable to property insurance proceeds of $42 million related primarily to the damage caused by the 2017 hurricanes on our Westin St. John resort. In addition, inventory spend was lower by $36 million and restricted cash increased $27 million primarily reflecting the collection of maintenance fees following the consolidation of our HOAs beginning in the fourth quarter of last year.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $16 million primarily related to capex associated with resort operations and sales and marketing locations, as well as IT initiatives. Capex in the quarter includes an offsetting $3 million of insurance proceeds for hurricane property damage.\nNet cash and restricted cash used in financing activities was $75 million, reflecting $45 million repayments on securitized debt, a dividend payment of $22 million, and $8 million withholding tax on the vesting of restricted stock units and shares.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $66 million, compared to $54 million in 2017. The change is primarily a result of the increase in net cash and restricted cash provided by operating activities, and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher net securitization activities, including higher repayments on securitizations.\nDividends\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, ILG paid $22 million, or $0.175 cents per share in dividends. In May 2018, our Board of Directors declared a $0.175 per share dividend payable June 12, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018.\nCombination with Marriott Vacations\nOn April 30, 2018, ILG announced it had entered into an agreement whereby Marriott Vacations Worldwide, Inc. (Marriott Vacations) will acquire ILG for a combination of cash and stock consideration which values the company at approximately $5.1 billion, based on Marriott Vacation’s closing price on April 27, 2018.\nILG shareholders will receive $14.75 per share in cash and the rest in newly issued shares of Marriott Vacations. The combination will result in ILG shareholders owning at closing 43.1% of the company on a fully-diluted basis, based on a fixed exchange ratio. Two ILG directors will be appointed to the board of the combined company.\nThe transaction, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second half of 2018. More information on the transaction can be found on the ILG website, ww.ilg.com .\nPRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nILG management believes that the presentation of non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures, including, among others, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted basic and diluted EPS, and free cash flow, serves to enhance the understanding of ILG's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance and liquidity prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, adjusted EBITDA (with certain different adjustments) is used to calculate compliance with certain financial covenants in ILG's credit agreement and indenture. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures improve the transparency of our disclosures, provide meaningful presentations of our results from our business operations and liquidity excluding the impact of certain items not related to our core business operations and improve the period to period comparability of results from business operations. These measures may also be useful in comparing our results to those of other companies; however, our calculations may differ from the calculations of these measures used by other companies. More information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of historical GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures, is available in the financial tables that accompany this press release.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nInvestors and analysts may listen to the live conference call by dialing (844) 832-7221 (toll-free domestic) or (973) 638-3062 (international); Conference ID: 2599704 .

The Company's presentation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, excluding the impact of (1) acquisition related and restructuring costs, (2) other non-operating foreign currency remeasurements, (3) the impact of the application of purchase accounting, (4) goodwill and asset impairments, and (5) other special items.\nAncillary member revenue - Other Interval Network member related revenue including insurance and travel related services.\nAverage revenue per member - Membership fee revenue, transaction revenue and ancillary member revenue for the Interval Network, Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club for the applicable period, divided by the monthly weighted average number of Interval Network active members during the applicable period.\nClub rental revenue – Represents rentals generated by the Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club mainly to monetize inventory to provide exchanges through hotel loyalty programs.\nConsolidated timeshare contract sales – Total timeshare interests sold at consolidated projects pursuant to purchase agreements, gross of incentives and net of actual cancellations and rescissions, where we have met a minimum threshold amounting to a 10% down payment of the contract purchase price during the period.
