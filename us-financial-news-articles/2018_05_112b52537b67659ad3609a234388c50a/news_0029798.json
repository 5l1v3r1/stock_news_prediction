(TSXV:LUM) (OTC:LUMAF) (the “Company” or “Lumina”) announces an updated mineral resource estimate for the Company’s Condor project, located in Zamora-Chinchipe Province, southeast Ecuador. This updated mineral resource estimate is the first since Lumina Gold acquired Condor and incorporates the 1,907 metres of drilling at Santa Barbara that has been completed since the acquisition in November 2016.\nMineral Resource Estimate Summary\nMillion Average Grade Contained Metal Deposit Tonnes AuEq\n(g/t) Au\n(g/t) Ag\n(g/t) Cu\n(%) AuEq\n(koz) Au\n(koz) Ag\n(koz) Cu\n(Mlbs) Indicated Santa Barbara 13.3 0.78 0.63 0.7 0.09 333 267 278 27 Soledad 11.6 0.81 0.72 5.3 0.01 300 269 1,951 3 Los Cuyes 38.6 0.77 0.68 5.5 0.02 953 841 6,858 13 Enma 0.4 0.91 0.76 11.9 0.01 10 9 136 0.1 Total Indicated 63.8 0.78 0.68 4.5 0.03 1,597 1,385 9,234 43 Inferred Santa Barbara 119.0 0.69 0.52 0.9 0.10 2,622 1,985 3,521 255 Soledad 2.8 0.59 0.54 3.1 0.01 52 48 271 1 Los Cuyes 22.7 0.73 0.65 5.7 0.01 534 475 4,118 4 Enma 0.03 1.26 1.12 10.4 0.01 1 1 11 0.01 Total Inferred 144.5 0.69 0.54 1.7 0.08 3,209 2,509 7,916 260 Notes:\n(1) The mineral resource estimate has an effective date of April 5, 2018. (2) There are no known issues related to environmental, permitting, legal, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, or political issues that could materially affect the mineral resource. (3) The quantity and grade of reported Inferred mineral resources in this estimation are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred mineral resources as an Indicated or Measured mineral resource. It is reasonable to expect that the majority of Inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to Indicated or Measured mineral resources with continued exploration. (4) The mineral resources in this estimate were calculated with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions. (5) Gold equivalent values were calculated using the following prices: for gold a price of US$1,400 per ounce, for copper a price of US$3.25 per pound and for silver a price of US$17 per ounce. Gold equivalent values can be calculated using the following formula: AuEq = Au g/t+(Ag g/t*0.0122)+(Cu%*1.592). (6) The base case cut-off grade for the estimate of mineral resources is 0.35g/t AuEq. (7) The Indicated and Inferred mineral resources are contained within a limiting pit shell and comprise a coherent body.\nFuture Activity and Exploration Plans\nLumina believes there are additional near surface drill targets at Santa Barbara. Exploration drilling and completion of the 29km geophysical Induced Polarization program has confirmed that the copper-gold mineralization has a distinctive high chargeability signature. Extensions to the resource that match this signature remain untested by drilling and constitute priority drill targets at the project.\nIn addition to Santa Barbara, the Condor land package covers a highly prospective area, within the most prolific mineral belt in Ecuador, along strike from significant gold and copper mines that are in construction. Lumina has been actively exploring the 10,101 hectare land package and has identified a large, four by two kilometre surface gold anomaly at the Prometedor prospect and an extension to the Los Cuyes deposit defined by a 200 metre by 200 metre surface gold anomaly that remains open.\nThe Santa Barbara and Los Cuyes extensions, Prometedor drill targets and others, continue to be advanced to drill stage. When ready, a drill will be mobilized to site to begin testing the targets in order of priority.\nComparative Commentary on the Current Mineral Resource Estimate Versus Prior Mineral Resource Estimates\nPrior technical reports by Al Maynard & Associates (effective date March 24, 2014) and by GBM Mineral Engineering Consultants Limited (“GBM”) (effective date May 19, 2015) took a substantially different approach to their classification of Inferred and Indicated mineral resources. The prior mineral resource estimates used a cut-off grade of 0.25g/t Au, versus the 0.35g/t AuEq cut-off used in the current mineral resource estimate. Although a cut-off grade that reflected the costs associated with open pit mining methods was used in the prior reports, there was no constraint on the mineral resource within economic pit shells. Accordingly, the updated mineral resource estimate is lower than prior mineral resource estimates. There is still substantial mineralization below and around the economic pit shells that could be re-incorporated into a mineral resource estimate in a higher gold and copper price environment. The majority of the mineral resource reduction occurred at the Santa Barbara deposit.\nThe May, 2015 PEA Technical Report that was prepared for Santa Barbara included an estimate of “material planned for processing” that was derived from the Indicated and Inferred resources. This material was potentially amenable to open pit extraction, but did not include mining losses or dilution.\nMaterial Planned for Processing:\n98.8Mt @ 0.72 g/t gold; 0.96 g/t silver; 0.11% copper; 2,272koz gold; 3,036koz silver; 233Mlbs copper.\nNote: the cut-off grade used to calculate “material planned for processing” is not stated in the GBM report.\nLumina’s management believes that the “material planned for processing” amount from that report provides a more appropriate comparison to the current Lumina Indicated and Inferred resource estimate methodology. The current resource estimate has higher tonnage, with 13Mt Indicated and 119Mt Inferred at a cut-off grade of 0.35 AuEq g/t. The contained gold and copper quantities are similar, with 267koz gold and 27Mlbs copper Indicated and 1,985koz gold and 255Mlbs copper Inferred.\nPrior Condor mineral resource estimates included the El Hito copper-molybdenum deposit. For the purpose of the current mineral resource estimate, it was determined that the nine holes of completed drilling were inadequate to form the basis of an estimate of Inferred mineral resources. An exploration target has been estimated based on the assumption that the mineralization is continuous between drill holes and extends to a depth of between 150m and 300m below surface. The exploration target has been estimated to have a range of mineralization between 150-250Mt, with grades of 0.25-0.35% copper and 0.003-0.005% molybdenum.\nThe Chinapintza area of Condor has also been classified as an exploration target. The area has over 100 drill holes, plus numerous surface trench samples. The Chinapintza exploration target has been estimated to have a range of mineralization between 0.7-1.0Mt, with 2-4g/t Au.\nThe potential quantities and grades of the exploration targets are not mineral resource estimates and are conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the exploration target being delineated as a mineral resource.\nSensitivity of the Mineral Resource Estimate to Cut-off Grade\nSanta Barbara Only\nCut-off\nMillion\nAverage Grade Contained Metal (AuEq g/t) Tonnes AuEq\n(g/t) Au\n(g/t) Ag\n(g/t) Cu\n(%) AuEq\n(koz) Au\n(koz) Ag\n(koz) Cu\n(Mlbs) Indicated 0.25 15.7 0.71 0.56 0.6 0.09 355 283 307 30 0.35 13.3 0.78 0.62 0.7 0.09 333 267 278 27 0.45 11.4 0.84 0.68 0.7 0.10 309 250 249 24 0.55 9.9 0.89 0.73 0.7 0.10 284 232 222 21 Inferred 0.25 130.3 0.65 0.49 0.9 0.09 2,731 2,059 3,771 270 0.35 119.0 0.69 0.52 0.9 0.10 2,622 1,985 3,521 255 0.45 99.5 0.74 0.57 1.0 0.10 2,369 1,813 3,071 224 0.55 78.2 0.81 0.62 1.0 0.11 2,026 1,568 2,540 184 Soledad, Los Cuyes and Enma Combined\nCut-off\nMillion\nAverage Grade Contained Metal (AuEq g/t) Tonnes AuEq\n(g/t) Au\n(g/t) Ag\n(g/t) Cu\n(%) AuEq\n(koz) Au\n(koz) Ag\n(koz) Cu\n(Mlbs) Indicated 0.25 61.2 0.69 0.61 5.1 0.01 1,366 1,203 10,009 18 0.35 50.6 0.78 0.69 5.5 0.01 1,264 1,118 8,956 16 0.45 40.2 0.87 0.78 6.0 0.02 1,132 1,006 7,712 14 0.55 31.2 0.98 0.88 6.4 0.02 987 882 6,422 12 Inferred 0.25 33.4 0.62 0.55 5.0 0.01 663 587 5,314 6 0.35 25.5 0.72 0.64 5.4 0.01 587 524 4,395 5 0.45 19.1 0.82 0.74 5.9 0.01 506 454 3,617 5 0.55 14.8 0.92 0.83 6.3 0.01 438 394 2,995 4 Notes:\n(1) The mineral resource estimate has an effective date of April 5, 2018.

(7) The Indicated and Inferred mineral resources are contained within a limiting pit shell and comprise a coherent body.\nThis updated mineral resource estimate was based on a total of 69,665 metres of diamond drilling in 296 holes across the four deposits. At Santa Barbara, mineral resources in the Indicated category were estimated using three or more drill holes that are spaced at a maximum distance of 75 m. At Soledad, Los Cuyes and Enma, mineral resources in the Indicated category are estimated using at least three drill holes that are spaced at a maximum distance of 50 m. Mineral resources in the Inferred category include model blocks that do not meet the criteria to be classified as Indicated resources, but are within a maximum distance of 100 m from a drill hole at Santa Barbara, or within a maximum distance of 75 m from a drill hole at Soledad, Los Cuyes and Enma. The mineral resource estimate was generated using drill hole sample assay results and the interpretation of a geological model which relates to the spatial distribution of gold, copper and silver. Sample data was collected following accepted industry procedures and analyzed by accredited commercial assayers and tracked by quality assurance/quality control programs that meet industry standards. Interpolation characteristics were defined based on the geology, drill hole spacing, and geostatistical analysis of the data. The effects of potentially anomalous high-grade sample data, composited to 2 metre intervals, are controlled using both traditional top-cutting as well as limiting the distance of influence during block grade interpolation. Block grades are estimated using ordinary kriging and have been validated using a combination of visual and statistical methods. The estimate of mineral resources is within a limiting pit shell derived using projected technical and economic parameters.\nA NI 43-101 technical report detailing the mineral resource estimate for the Condor Project will be completed and filed on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ) and Lumina's website ( www.luminagold.com ) within 45 days.\nResults From the November 2017 - January 2018 Condor Drilling\nLumina drilled nine holes and 1,907 metres around the Santa Barbara deposit, testing new near surface step out areas outside of the previous mineral resource estimate. Three of the nine holes intersected mineralization, the most significant mineralized intervals are as follows:\nHole\nNumber From\n(m) To\n(m) Interval\n(m) Au Grade\n(g/t) Cu Grade\n(%) Azimuth\n(°) Dip\n(°) Total\nDepth (m) DSB_50 60.00 122.0 62.00 0.31 0.13 45 -45 301.75 146.00 192.00 46.00 0.51 0.16 262.00 301.75 39.75 0.36 0.17 DSB_52 102.00 155.45 53.45 0.34 0.11 225 -45 155.45 DSB_53 36.00 48.00 12.00 0.34 0.03 45 -45 192.00 Note: Intervals in the reported holes are calculated using a cut-off of 0.2 g/t Au with maximum internal dilution of 10 continuous metres and the highest gold value used in the reported weighted averages is 1.83 g/t Au. All Lumina core samples were analyzed by 30g FA and ICP 4-acid digestion.\nQuality Assurance\nAll Lumina sample assay results have been independently monitored through a quality control / quality assurance (\"QA/QC\") program including the insertion of blind standards, blanks and the reanalysis of duplicate samples. The results of the QA/QC program and the resampling program indicate that the sample database is of sufficient accuracy and precision to be used for the generation of mineral resource estimates.\nQualified Persons\nRobert Sim, P.Geo., a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, is responsible for the estimate of mineral resources presented in this news release and has reviewed, verified and approved the contents of this news release as they relate to the mineral resource estimate.
