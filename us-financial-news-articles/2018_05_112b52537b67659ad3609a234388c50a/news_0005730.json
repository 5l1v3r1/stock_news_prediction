There is nothing to boost the market,” said a stockbroker in Colombo where the stock index ended flat on Tuesday.\nThe coalition government and its reform agenda has been under pressure since a political party backed by Sri Lanka’s former president Mahinda Rajapaksa won a landslide victory in local polls on Feb. 10.[nL4N1Q10EG]\nThe government has struggled to deliver on its 2015 campaign promises to impose fiscal discipline as recommended by multi-lateral lenders, reform the constitution to give more power to the provinces, and begin an international probe in alleged war crimes during the final phase of Sri Lanka’s civil war which ended in 2009.\n“The country does not need a cabinet reshuffle at this point, but reforms to restructure the country,” said Victor Ivan, an independent political columnist.
