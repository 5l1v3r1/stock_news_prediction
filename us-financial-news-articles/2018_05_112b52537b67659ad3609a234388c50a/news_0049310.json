U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 67 cents to $71.17 a barrel, a 0.9 percent loss.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may decide in June to lift output to make up for reduced supply from Venezuela and Iran, the latter in part due to the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear arms control deal, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters.\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said production cuts could be eased “softly” if OPEC and non-OPEC countries see the oil market balancing in June, the Interfax news agency reported.\nRussia and Saudi Arabia have a common position on the future of the oil output cut deal, Novak told Interfax news agency, though he said the deal would stay in place for now. Russia’s Lukoil ( LKOH.MM ) said the deal should remain in place but needs to be altered.\n“A move to put more oil on the market by Saudi Arabia and Russia would be very bearish for prices. The mere contemplation of it has hit oil prices this week,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.\nVenezuela’s output has fallen to about 1.4 million barrels per day, according to OPEC secondary sources, as its economic crisis grows and state-run PDVSA struggles to pay its debts and fund operations.

The United States in February produced 10.3 million bpd, a record.\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump called off a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over that nation’s nuclear aims.\nTrump’s comments should be negative for oil prices, but the comments pushed the dollar index down, supporting crude futures, Commerzbank strategist Carsten Fritsch said.\nA weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities less expensive for holders of other currencies.
