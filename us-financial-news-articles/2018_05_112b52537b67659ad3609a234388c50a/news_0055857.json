REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\nDenmark is the only country to formally classify certain residential zones as ghettos. An area fits into the category if more than half of its inhabitants originate from non-Western countries and it also matches certain other criteria, such as unemployment exceeding 40 percent.\n“When journalists come here I want to talk about the good things, but they’re not interested. They are interested in gangs, conflict and ghettos. It saddens me,” said Salim El-Chahabi, a Palestinian who came to Denmark in 1999 and works as a youth job coordinator in the Copenhagen ghetto of Mjolnerparken.\n“Only a few people create chaos, the rest of the inhabitants are good, polite family people. Unfortunately, a few people have ruined things for us.”\n(Click reut.rs/2LEzZU6 for a package of pictures.)\nDenmark has struggled for decades with how to integrate immigrants into its welfare state. The public debate intensified in 2015 with the arrival of large groups of refugees from conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. The anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party became the second-largest party in parliament in an election that year.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\nIn March this year, Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of the Liberal Party announced a plan aimed at boosting the integration of immigrants and eliminating ghettos - a word that is the same in Danish - by 2030.\nMeasures include banning criminals from moving into the areas, giving double punishment for crimes committed in ghettos, and demolishing then rebuilding parts of the zones.\nThe plan has met with a mixed response in Mjolnerparken in central Copenhagen, one of the country’s 25 ghettos - a term that originated in 16th-century Venice and was used to describe certain areas of the city to which Jews were restricted.

You’re spending all your time explaining that you’re not getting beaten up at home or that you’re not a terrorist.” Reporting by Emil Gjerding Nielson; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Pravin Char", "external_links": ["https://reut.rs/2LEzZU6"], "published": "2018-05-29T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:01:16.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
