Private citizens will be able to board flights, taking off from Dulles National Airport, through the atmosphere before landing back in Dulles, for a small fee, via the EPA’s new private airline.\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for the EPA provided the following statement.\n“As a result of our efforts to make U.S. businesses more competitive and less weighted down by responsibilities to the environment, we’ve received some criticism. To share our work with the public, we invite any U.S. citizen with $180,000 to experience the opportunity to fly directly through the widening hole in the ozone layer.”\nFor citizens worried there may be a nationwide water contamination crisis , the flight only uses Fiji-brand water, including in the restrooms, which may help justify the $180,000 airfare.\nWhile Pruitt seems enthusiastic, there are some EPA employees who believe this stunt does not serve the original mission of the agency.\n“There is no reason to believe flying through a hole in the ozone will be beneficial, to either the passenger or the planet,” said one EPA official, who requested his name would not be used in fear of retaliation. “But it will definitely be expensive.”\nA spokesperson for Pruitt also reached out to reiterate that the EPA head has also taken cost saving measures in the past, such as renting a condo for a thrifty $50 per night . The spokesperson also clarified, per recent precedent set by the EPA , media will be barred from traveling on these new flights.\nFor more satire from Fortune, click here .", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "http://komonews.com/news/nation-world/epa-bars-ap-cnn-from-summit-on-contaminants", "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/30/politics/epa-pruitt-travel-whitehouse-rose-bowl-disneyland/index.html"], "published": "2018-05-22T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:47:53.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
