REUTERS/Jose Cabezas Picture Supplied by Action Images FIFA said Maradiaga, a Honduran who played for his own country in the 1982 World Cup, had “allowed and failed to report” a meeting in which a third party offered the players “financial compensation” in exchange for fixing the result.\nIt said the offer was rejected and reported by the players in a news conference on Sept. 5, 2016. The incident was widely reported at the time.\nMaradiaga could not immediately be reached for comment.\nEl Salvador were bottom of their four-team group with two points from five games and had already been eliminated from the competition for places at this year’s finals in Russia.\nHowever, a heavy defeat for El Salvador could have potentially allowed Canada to finish above Honduras and progress to the next stage of the competition on goal difference.\nIn the event, Canada won 3-1 but were eliminated after Honduras drew 0-0 away to Mexico.\nMaradiaga, 63, was found guilty of violating FIFA ethics rules on bribery and corruption and duty of disclosure, FIFA said in a statement. He was also fined 20,000 Swiss francs ($20,036.06).\nHe is widely known in Central America, having also coached the national teams of Honduras and Guatemala as well a number of clubs including Marathon, Motagua, Real Espana and Aguila.\nCentral America is seen as especially vulnerable to match-fixing as many clubs struggle financially, playing conditions are poor and players often do not get paid on time.\nIn 2013, El Salvador banned 14 international players for life for match-fixing, including some of their best-known and most experienced names.\n($1 = 0.9982 Swiss francs)\nWriting by Brian Homewood in Bern; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T19:30:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
