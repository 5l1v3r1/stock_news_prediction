(\"Salix\"), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE/TSX: VRX), and its partner Norgine B.V. (\"Norgine\") announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PLENVU® (polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium ascorbate, sodium sulfate, ascorbic acid, sodium chloride and potassium chloride for oral solution), a lower-volume (1L) polyethylene glycol based (PEG) bowel preparation.\nColorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women and the second leading cause in men in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that there are approximately 97,000 new cases of colon cancer and 43,000 new cases of rectal cancer each year. 1 It is also shown that successful colorectal cancer screening can help save lives. 1\n\"With the FDA approval of PLENVU®, physicians can now offer their patients a new preparation option for colonoscopies that features a lower-volume, one-liter PEG bowel preparation,\" said Mark McKenna, senior vice president and general manager, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Studies have shown that high-volume bowel preparations can often be a deterrent to patients fully completing their preparation regimen. In contrast, PLENVU® is the lowest, total-volume preparation bowel cleanser available in the United States.\"\nAccording to patients' experiences and reported barriers to colonoscopy, most patients perceived the bowel preparation to be the most burdensome part of colonoscopy. 2 Complaints regarding bowel preparation typically relate to the large volumes necessary to consume and the unpleasant taste. By reducing the volume of solution patients must consume for effective bowel cleansing to only one liter of active solution, Salix hopes to improve the patient colonoscopy preparation experience with PLENVU®.\n\"Often considered to be the gold standard, colonoscopy is the most effective screening method for the detection and prevention of colon cancer. With today's approval, we have a next-generation, one liter low volume option while still providing adequate and effective cleansing,\" said Philip Schoenfeld, M.D.\nThe approval was based on multiple Phase 3 clinical trials, including the NOCT study, 3 which compares PLENVU® versus a trisulfate bowel cleansing solution (SUPREP ® ) using a two-day split-dosing regimen in adults. Both primary endpoints were met, achieving non-inferior overall bowel cleansing success and 'Excellent plus Good' cleansing of the ascending colon. PLENVU® is also the only FDA-approved bowel cleanser to offer split dosing on the same day as the colonoscopy procedure.\nPLENVU® was licensed by Salix from Norgine in August 2016 for introduction to the U.S. market and will be available in the U.S market in the third quarter of 2018.\nIn Europe, PLENVU® is approved and available through Norgine.\nAbout PLENVU ® ( polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium ascorbate, sodium sulfate, ascorbic acid, sodium chloride and potassium chloride for oral solution )\nPLENVU® (NER1006) is a low-volume (1L) polyethylene glycol based bowel preparation that has been developed to provide whole bowel cleansing, with an additional focus on the ascending colon.\nPLENVU® Phase 3 Clinical Trial Program\nNOCT study. A U.S. study that compared PLENVU ® to a trisulfate bowel cleansing solution using a two-day evening/morning split-dosing regimen in adults. Both primary endpoints were met. PLENVU ® was as effective as a trisulfate solution in achieving overall bowel cleansing success and 'high quality' cleansing of the right colon. 3 MORA study. A European study that compared PLENVU ® to MOVIPREP ® using a two-day evening/morning split-dosing regimen and a one-day morning only split-dosing regimen in adults. The study met both of its primary endpoints. When administered using either dosing regimen, PLENVU ® was as effective as MOVIPREP ® in achieving overall bowel cleansing success, and superior to MOVIPREP ® in achieving 'high quality' cleansing of the right colon using the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). 4\nAbout Norgine\nNorgine is a leading European specialist pharmaceutical company with a direct commercial presence in all major European markets.
