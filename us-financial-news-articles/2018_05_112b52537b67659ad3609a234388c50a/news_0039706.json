(NASDAQ:HBNC) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a 3-for-2 stock split on Horizon’s authorized and outstanding shares of common stock. Shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 31, 2018, the record date, will be entitled to receive an additional half share for each share of common stock held.\nShareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of common stock that they otherwise would have been entitled to receive in connection with the split, except that those shareholders participating in Horizon’s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans will have fractional shares of common stock credited to their accounts. The price paid for fractional shares will be based on the average closing price of a share of common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five trading days immediately prior to the record date.\nIn connection with the 3-for-2 stock split, the Board of Directors has approved an amendment to Horizon’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the amount of authorized common shares in the same proportion. The amendment will become effective upon approval by the Indiana Secretary of State, and the 66 million common shares presently authorized will become 99 million authorized common shares.\nThe additional shares issued in the stock split are expected to be distributed to shareholders on June 15, 2018. Horizon common shares are expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on or about June 18, 2018, or such other date specified by NASDAQ.\nCraig M. Dwight, Horizon’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Horizon has a strong and stable shareholder base, and we appreciate the large number of long-term, loyal shareholders. This split is intended to improve the liquidity for our stock by making more shares available in the marketplace, and to make our stock affordable and attractive to investors. We believe Horizon offers the opportunity to invest in a growing community bank that has consistently offered an attractive cash dividend and solid growth.”\nThe stock split will increase Horizon’s outstanding shares from approximately 25.6 million shares prior to the split to approximately 38.4 million shares.\nAbout Horizon\nHorizon Bancorp, Inc. is an independent, commercial bank holding company serving northern and central Indiana, and southern, central and the Great Lakes Bay regions of Michigan through its commercial banking subsidiary Horizon Bank.
