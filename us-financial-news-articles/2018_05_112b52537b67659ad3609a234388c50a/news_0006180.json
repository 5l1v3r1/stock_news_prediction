It is unclear when the short-range surface-to-surface, surface-to-air missile systems will become operational.\nA senior naval commander said the Philippines would now be more of a force in patrolling the South China Sea and its pirate-plagued southern waters.\n“It will be a deterrent because, this time, we have a credible armament that can strike a punch whether the target is a small or large ship,” said the commander, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media.\nThe missiles have a maximum range of eight km (5 miles).\nThe Philippines is paying $11.6 million in total for the system and the missiles will be installed on three boats from its fleet of small, fast gunboats.\nIts warships, which include two South Korean-made frigates, will be armed with advanced, longer-range missiles.\nThe Philippines has allocated 125 billion peso ($2.41 billion) over the next five years to acquire frigates, fighter jets, helicopters, surveillance planes, drones and radar systems.\n($1 = 51.9010 pesos)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:34:18.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
