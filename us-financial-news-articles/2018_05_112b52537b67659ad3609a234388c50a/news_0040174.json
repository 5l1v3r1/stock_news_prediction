(TSX: GRT.UN / NYSE: GRP.U) (\" Granite REIT \" and \" Granite GP \", and, collectively \" Granite \") today announced the acceptance by the Toronto Stock Exchange (the \" TSX \") of Granite GP's Notice of Intention to Make a Normal Course Issuer Bid (\" NCIB \"). Pursuant to the NCIB, Granite GP proposes to purchase through the facilities of the TSX and any alternative trading system in Canada, from time to time over the next 12 months, if considered advisable, up to an aggregate of 3,939,255 of Granite`s issued and outstanding stapled units (the \" Stapled Units \") (each Stapled Unit consisting of one trust unit of Granite REIT and one common share of Granite GP), being approximately 10% of Granite's public float of Stapled Units as of April 30, 2018. Pursuant to a previous notice of intention to conduct a NCIB, under which Granite sought and received approval from the TSX to purchase up to 4,118,757 Stapled Units for the period of May 16, 2017 to May 15, 2018, Granite has purchased, as of April 30, 2018, 1,474,493 Stapled Units on the open market at a weighted average purchase price of $49.49 per Stapled Unit. As of April 30, 2018, Granite had 45,733,941 Stapled Units issued and outstanding and a public float of 39,392,552 Stapled Units.\nThe NCIB will commence on May 18, 2018 and will conclude on the earlier of the date on which purchases under the bid have been completed and May 17, 2019. Pursuant to the policies of the TSX, daily purchases made by Granite GP through the TSX may not exceed 16,546 Stapled Units, being 25% of the average daily trading volume of the Stapled Units on the TSX for the six-month period ended April 30, 2018, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by the TSX, including the \"block purchase exemption\".\nGranite GP intends to enter into an automatic securities purchase plan with a broker in order to facilitate repurchases of the Stapled Units under the NCIB during Granite's scheduled blackout periods. Under the automatic securities purchase plan, Granite GP's broker may repurchase Stapled Units under the NCIB in accordance with any advance instructions that Granite GP may elect to deliver, including without limitation repurchases made at times when Granite GP would ordinarily not be permitted to repurchase Stapled Units due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods. Purchases will be made by Granite GP's broker based upon the parameters under the NCIB and the terms of the parties' written agreement.\nThe Board of Trustees of Granite REIT and the Board of Directors of Granite GP believe that the proposed purchases at prices below Granite's view of intrinsic value are in the best interests of Granite and are a desirable use of Granite's funds. All Stapled Units that are purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.\nABOUT GRANITE\nGranite is a Canadian-based REIT engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership and management of predominantly industrial, warehouse and logistics properties in North America and Europe.
