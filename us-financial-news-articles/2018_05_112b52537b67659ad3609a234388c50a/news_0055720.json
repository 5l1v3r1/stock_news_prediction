Who would drug legalization be good for? Latin America and the Caribbean, for God’s sake. Because the illegality is what’s killing people,” she said. “It’s time to seriously consider legalizing drugs.”\nPeru, Colombia and Bolivia are the top producers of coca leaves used to make cocaine, much of which is smuggled through Mexico to reach the world’s biggest market, the United States.\nThe battle to dominate crystal meth and heroin markets has also precipitated mounting violence in Mexico.\nMost countries in the Americas continue to pursue restrictive policies toward drugs, although growing liberalization of marijuana laws in the United States has encouraged supporters of legalization to redouble their efforts.\nReporting by Diego Ore; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T07:13:07.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
