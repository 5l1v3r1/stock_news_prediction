(NASDAQ:DARE), a clinical-stage, women’s biopharmaceutical company, today announced it has appointed Mr. Fair to the newly created position of Chief Business Officer. Mr. Fair’s role will include business and corporate development, partnering, and strategic planning. Mr. Fair was formerly the President and COO of Evofem Inc.\n“John’s deep understanding of the women’s health business, coupled with his substantial experience at the most senior levels in business development and planning will serve Daré well during our next phase of corporate development, where we seek to establish global alliances for our portfolio,” said Sabrina Martucci Johnson, CEO of Daré Bioscience. “We are looking forward to John’s leadership in establishing partnerships for Daré as we look toward advancing our products through clinical development.”\nMr. Fair has over twenty years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry in business and corporate development roles. Most recently, Mr. Fair was President and COO of Evofem Inc., a late-stage, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on women’s reproductive health. He was part of the management team that secured a global license to the Nestorone® one-year contraceptive vaginal ring, successfully divested the OTC women’s hygiene franchise and closed series C and D funding. Prior to joining Evofem, Mr. Fair held senior-level roles at WomanCare Global, a UK based global women’s health entity. During his tenure he was part of the management team that collaborated with FHI 360 to commercialize Sino-implant (II) in select regions and secured donor funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID).\nMr. Fair holds a master’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine and a BA from Rider University.\nAbout Daré Bioscience\nDaré Bioscience is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s reproductive health that address clear therapeutic gaps. The Company is driven by a mission to identify, develop and bring to market a diverse portfolio of novel and differentiated therapies that expand treatment options, improve outcomes and facilitate convenience for women, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health and fertility. Daré currently has two product candidates in clinical development. The first is Ovaprene, a non-hormonal monthly contraceptive ring intended to provide protection over multiple weeks between menses. The second is SST-6007 (5% Topical Sildenafil Citrate Cream), a potential treatment for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder. SST-6007 incorporates sildenafil, the same active ingredient in Viagra ® , in a proprietary cream formulation that is specifically designed to locally increase blood flow to the vulvar-vaginal tissue in women, leading to a potential improvement in genital arousal response and overall sexual experience. Daré has also entered into an agreement to acquire PT-101, a vaginal tamoxifen tablet, as a potential treatment for vulvar and vaginal atrophy in the hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer population, which includes estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR-positive) breast cancer. PT-101 incorporates the active ingredient tamoxifen, which is currently approved by the FDA in an oral form as a treatment for hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Daré’s preclinical portfolio includes a novel intravaginal ring technology platform that was developed by Dr. Robert Langer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr. William Crowley from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, including three preclinical candidates. Portfolio expansion opportunities include Daré’s option to enter into a license agreement for ORB-204 and ORB-214, preclinical stage injectable etonogestrel contraceptives with target 6- and 12-month durations.\nContacts:\nInvestors on behalf of Daré Bioscience, Inc.:\nAmi Bavishi\nBurns McClellan\nabavishi@burnsmc.com\n212-213-0006\nOR\nMedia on behalf of Daré Bioscience, Inc.:\nAmanda Guisbond\nCanale Communications\namanda@canalecomm.com\n781-405-8775\nSource: Daré Bioscience\nSource:Dare Bioscience, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Y_An6anip0klh_rp9tGVe_Xnp59yfId_A9lmXm6-KSfrXCCn28LL4QRQW4fB163BgNoCisMiuuprRJ47xcmKxCOadzUjtkwRbazFu2SU1Ms=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9KLFrxw_wqaqejVQKWqi3qq91yW4SazIIqrMjOtuo-cNunxjOK9GBWlUOYQTa_rz4aaLElkR8CA6elKfbhGNnZKkOqnERrVSqPkAthwusIU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/51be2e68-4397-4bd8-936a-804f85b00db3"], "published": "2018-05-08T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:32:53.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
