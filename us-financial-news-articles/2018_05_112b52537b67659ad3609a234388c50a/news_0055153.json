Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P.M.,” Trump said on Twitter. “The great people of Utah will be very happy!”\nJoshua Holt’s release, which hadn’t been previously reported, came less than a day after Republican Senator Bob Corker met with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas. Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\nMaduro was shown shaking hands with Corker in images broadcast on state TV from the presidential palace, which said the two were “strengthening international relationships,” without offering more details.\nCorker then walked out alongside Carabobo State Governor Rafael Lacava, who’s said to have visited Washington earlier in the year to discuss the release of Holt, a former Mormon missionary arrested in Caracas about 18 months ago, after he traveled there to marry his Venezuelan girlfriend. Humanitarian Grounds\nAfter being sworn in for a second six-year term this week, Maduro called for the release of some detained prisoners, without naming anyone specifically. Holt, who’s being held in the El Helicoide intelligence agency prison on weapons charges his family says are false, published a Facebook video earlier this month pleading for help and claiming his life was in danger.\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month that a senior department official had urged Holt’s release on humanitarian grounds.\nCorker’s fellow Republican, Marco Rubio, lashed out at the Tennessee lawmaker on Friday for meeting with Maduro.\n“Any U.S. Senator can meet with whoever they want. But no matter how many senators dictator Nicolas Maduro gets to meet with him, U.S. sanctions will go away when Maduro leaves and democracy returns,” Rubio said on Twitter.\nThe Florida senator is a longtime critic of Corker, who’s chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to which Rubio also belongs. Corker’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment. Rubio was more conciliatory after word of Holt’s release, tweeting that “his UNCONDITIONAL release was long overdue.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1000366478846300165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-05-26T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:41:51.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
