(NASDAQ: CNCE) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\n“Concert has begun 2018 with strong momentum as our pipeline of first-in-class drug candidates for serious diseases is progressing in important efficacy trials, with the first data read out later this year for CTP-543,” said Roger Tung, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Concert Pharmaceuticals. “We look forward to the progression of multiple Concert-discovered compounds over the coming quarters, including our proprietary drug candidates, CTP-543 for alopecia areata and CTP-692 for schizophrenia.”\nDr. Tung also commented, “As we’ve demonstrated with our platform, early clinical studies of well-chosen deuterium-modified drugs can rapidly create value. Two clear examples of that include VX-561, which Vertex may advance into Phase 3 development for cystic fibrosis, and AVP-786 which is in Phase 3 evaluation for Alzheimer’s agitation under our collaboration with Avanir Pharmaceuticals. Both VX-561 and AVP-786 have the potential to provide substantial additional financial upside to Concert.”\nRecent Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nAutoimmune Dermatology\nCTP-543 Phase 2a Trial for Alopecia Areata Fully Enrolled. In April 2018, the Company completed patient enrollment of its Phase 2a trial evaluating CTP-543 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe alopecia areata. This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential dose trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses twice daily of CTP-543 in approximately 90 patients. Topline data from the 4 mg and 8 mg cohorts is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. The primary outcome measure will utilize the severity of alopecia tool (SALT) after 24 weeks of dosing. If appropriate, the protocol may be amended to explore 12 mg twice daily of CTP-543. CTP-543 Granted Fast Track Designation. In January 2018, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for CTP-543. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review process for therapies for serious medical conditions which offer the potential to significantly advance the existing standard of care. FDA Voice of the Patient: Alopecia Areata. Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Patient-Focused Drug Development meeting held in September 2017 on alopecia areata, the FDA summarized the input shared by patients and patient representatives in a Voice of the Patient report. The public meeting on alopecia areata provided FDA with patient input on the impact of alopecia areata, including on daily life, patient views on treatment approaches, and decision factors taken into account when selecting a treatment. PTAB Institutes IPR Proceeding . In April 2018, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) granted the request for rehearing of the PTAB’s decision denying institution of the Inter Partes Review (IPR) filed by Incyte Corporation against Concert’s U.S. Patent No. 9,249,149. Concert believes in the validity of its patent claims and intends to vigorously defend the patent.\nNeuropsychiatry\nCTP-692 Preclinical Results Support Development in Schizophrenia. In March 2018, Concert announced the selection of CTP-692, a novel drug candidate for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia, as its next development candidate. CTP-692 is a deuterated form of D-serine, an endogenous co-agonist of the NMDA receptor. Patients with schizophrenia have been shown to have lower plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of D-serine than individuals without schizophrenia. Based on early clinical results of D-serine and Concert’s initial preclinical assessment of CTP-692, the Company believes that CTP-692 has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia. The Company intends to advance CTP-692 into clinical development by year-end 2018. CTP-692 NMDA Receptor Activity Nearly Identical to D-Serine . In preclinical testing, Concert demonstrated that CTP-692 and D-serine have nearly identical binding and functional activity at the human NMDA receptor.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash and Investments Position: Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2018, totaled $191.0 million as compared to $203.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Concert expects its cash, cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2018 to be sufficient to fund the Company into 2021. Revenues: Revenue was $10.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $20,000 for the same period in 2017. Revenue recognized in 2018 consists of $10.5 million primarily in non-cash consideration received from Processa Pharmaceuticals under a licensing agreement whereby Processa has worldwide rights to develop and commercialize CTP-499, a deuterated analog of 1-(S)-5-hydroxyhexyl-3,7-dimethylxanthine, an active metabolite of pentoxifylline. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $8.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, research and development expenses were primarily associated with the development of CTP-543 and CTP-692. In the first quarter of 2017, research and development expenses were primarily associated with the development of CTP-543 and CTP-656, the Company’s product candidate for cystic fibrosis which was acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in July 2017. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $5.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Net Loss: For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net loss applicable to common stockholders was $4.5 million, or $0.19 per share, compared with a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $13.3 million, or $0.60 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET to provide an update on the Company and discuss first quarter financial results.
