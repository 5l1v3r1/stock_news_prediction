Guardado. “He’s only 23 years old and is going to get better. I think he’s doing something that nobody has probably ever done and it might be a long time before you see it again. There’s another guy (Mike Trout) in that clubhouse who is a really good player, but to me, with what he does on the mound and with the bat, he’s probably the best player in the world.”\nOhtani threw a season-high 103 pitches Sunday, striking out 11 and surrendering just one run on three hits in 6 1/3 innings. He received a no-decision in Los Angeles’ 2-1 walk-off win.

Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\nMorrison reached base all three times he faced the right-hander, picking up a pair of singles and later drawing a one-out walk in the seventh that chased Ohtani from the game.\nOhtani has set MLB abuzz this season, garnering comparisons to Babe Ruth with his prowess as a two-way player. He is 3-1 with a 3.58 ERA in six starts on the mound, and is batting .348 with five home runs and 16 RBIs at the plate.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T23:07:45.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
