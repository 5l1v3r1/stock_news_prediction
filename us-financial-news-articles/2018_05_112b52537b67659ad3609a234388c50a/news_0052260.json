Only Russia produces more, at about 11 million bpd.\nOutput from the likes of the United States, Canada and Brazil, which are not bound by the OPEC/Russian-led pact, is likely to rise further as crude prices rise.\n\"With oil prices rising more than costs, average industry profitability has turned positive this year,\" Bernstein Energy said in a note this week, adding that the 50 largest listed oil companies need oil at $47 a barrel to break even in aggregate.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein and Roslan Khasawneh Editing by David Goodman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:45:33.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
