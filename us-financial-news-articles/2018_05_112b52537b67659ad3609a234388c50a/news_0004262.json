(Nasdaq:ADVM), a clinical-stage gene therapy company targeting unmet medical needs in serious rare and ocular diseases, announced that the board of directors and Amber Salzman, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer and director, made a mutual determination that Dr. Salzman step down from these roles, effective May 3, 2018. The board of directors is initiating a search process to recruit a new president and chief executive officer. Leone Patterson, senior vice president and chief financial officer, has been appointed interim president and chief executive officer of Adverum. Dr. Salzman has agreed to serve as a consultant to the Company for a period of time in order to help ensure a smooth transition.\nSeparately, Athena Countouriotis, M.D., chief medical officer, has resigned effective May 11, 2018. Linda Neuman, M.D., M.B.A, vice president, clinical development, will serve as Adverum’s interim chief medical officer.\n“After transforming into a clinical-stage company last year, Adverum is entering a new phase of growth, advancing gene therapy candidates into the clinic, beginning the initial stages of scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and planning for future potential product commercialization. The board and Amber have agreed that at this important time Adverum is best served by a chief executive officer based out of Company headquarters, rather than commuting weekly from the East Coast,” said Paul Cleveland, chairman of the board of Adverum Biotechnologies. “We appreciate Amber’s leadership in transforming Adverum into a clinical-stage company and her dedication to helping patients. During this transition, we have a strong leadership team in place, including Leone Patterson, Mehdi Gasmi, Ph.D., Linda Neuman, M.D., and Jennifer Cheng, Ph.D., J.D.”\n“We continue to focus on executing our ADVANCE Phase 1/2 clinical trial for ADVM-043 in patients with A1AT deficiency,” said Leone Patterson, interim president and chief executive officer, and chief financial officer, of Adverum. “In late April 2018, we dosed the first patient in Cohort 2 and we continue to enroll patients. We plan to report preliminary data from this study in the second half of 2018 and use these data to inform next steps, including potential further dose escalation. In addition, this week we shared long-term preclinical efficacy data on ADVM-022 in a non-human primate model of wAMD, demonstrating that the efficacy at 13 months post-administration was consistent with earlier reported data. We look forward to presenting these new durability data in a poster on May 17, 2018 at the ASGCT 21st Annual Meeting. We continue to make progress toward submitting two new Investigational New Drug Applications to the Food and Drug Administration, one for ADVM-022 in wet AMD and another ADVM-053 in hereditary angioedema, in the second half of 2018 as we work to advance these two novel gene therapies into the clinic.”\nAs of March 31, 2018, Adverum had $247.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nLeone Patterson joined Adverum in June 2016 as chief financial officer and became senior vice president and chief financial officer in February 2018.
