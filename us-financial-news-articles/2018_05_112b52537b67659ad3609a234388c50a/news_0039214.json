Subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, Cheniere is proposing consideration of 0.4500 Cheniere shares for each outstanding publicly-held share of Cheniere Partners Holdings as part of a transaction that would be structured as a merger of Cheniere Partners Holdings with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cheniere.
