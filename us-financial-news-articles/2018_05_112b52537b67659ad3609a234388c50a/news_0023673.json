That’s because it can take up to 15 years to develop a drug, much longer than to develop software.\nLife sciences funding comprises 32 percent of grants by the IIA, which has a budget of 1.7 billion shekels ($473 million).\nTel Aviv will host the international MIXiii Biomed conference next week.\n$1 = 3.5909 shekels Reporting by Steven Scheer; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:31:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
