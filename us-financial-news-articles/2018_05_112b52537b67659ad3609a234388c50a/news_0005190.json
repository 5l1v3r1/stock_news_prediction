Last year, it generated revenues of 29 million euros and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 5 million euros.\nAt 0710 GMT, Mondi shares in London were up 0.8 percent.\n$1 = 0.8245 euros Reporting by Nqobile Dludla, Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:13:49.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
