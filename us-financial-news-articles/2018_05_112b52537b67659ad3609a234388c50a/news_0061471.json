Italy’s two-year government bond yields dropped to 1.13%, down from 1.763% Wednesday and 2.099% on Tuesday. Yields fall as prices rise.\nThe Euro Stoxx index, which includes only stocks in the eurozone, rose 0.2%. Eurozone banks were among the best-performing sectors, rising by 0.5%.\nS&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were each flat Thursday after a rally in U.S. equities Wednesday .\nThe political impasse in Rome caused a sharp selloff in global markets early this week, following President Sergio Mattarella’s decision to block the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government and to ask ex-International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli to form a caretaker government.\nThe deadlock means that Italy’s voters may soon return to the polls.\n“Cotarelli is a credible, market-friendly prime minister, but the market clearly doubts that he will be a stabilizing force for long,” said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman.\nThe Quirinal Palace, the Italian president’s residence, in Rome.

Consumer prices rose by 1.9% on the year, with core consumer prices, which strip out volatile items like food and energy, rising 1.1%.\nNewsletter Sign-up The eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.5% in April, from 8.6% in March.\nMost Asian markets rose Thursday, with China’s Shenzhen A-Share index rising 1.8%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng up 1.4% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.8%. Despite the rally, most Asian bourses recorded declines in May.\nIn foreign exchange markets, the euro continued to recover lost ground , rising 0.2% to $1.169 against the dollar, after falling to as low as $1.153 Tuesday.\n“We may now have a period of calm while investors await the latest attempt of the forming of a government and gauge the future policy path in the wake of the turmoil. The scope for further euro gains will likely be limited for now,” said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at MUFG.\nWrite to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-12594?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12594?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12594?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12594?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12594?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12594?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-05-31T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:49:09.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
