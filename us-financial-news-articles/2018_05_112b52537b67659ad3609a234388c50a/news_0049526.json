U.S. gold futures for June delivery were 0.07 percent lower at $1,303.60.\nGold is traditionally used as a safe place to park assets in times of uncertainty, but Trump's decision would have limited impact on prices, said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.\n\"This is pretty typical for these kinds of geopolitical jitters. Very short-term sharp reaction, then a lack of follow through, given that this basically does not have any implication for the global economy or financial markets,\" he said. \"Based on this pattern and on gold's very tight relationship with the U.S. dollar, this uplift in price should be temporary and we should fall back below $1,300 an ounce.\"\nGold tends to move higher when the U.S. dollar weakens because this makes dollar-priced bullion cheaper for buyers with other currencies.
