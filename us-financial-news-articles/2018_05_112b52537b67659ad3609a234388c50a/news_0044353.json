However, both drugs are still deemed unsuitable for acute life-threatening hyperkalemia episodes.\n“Whilst we must concede the label is not a best-case, we nonetheless see it as an improvement on the only incumbent option, Vifor’s Veltassa,” Barclays analysts said in a note. “Our thesis remains that Lokelma will be the dominant player in the eventual $3 billion hyperkalemia market.”\nAstraZeneca is banking on a range of new drugs to return the company to sales growth in 2018. Last week it reported first-quarter results that showed the impact of generic competition to older medicines, but promising sales of newer ones.\nAstraZeneca shares, which fell on Friday’s financial results, were up 2 percent on Monday.
