Longer term, ageing demographics could be a substantial drag on economies and digitalisation may be a source of uncertainty.\nMost economies should therefore look to strengthen policy buffers as closing output gaps means they do not need further fiscal support, the Fund said.\nFor now, with pressure on wages and prices still “moderate”, monetary policy can remain accommodative in most of Asia. But central banks should stand ready to adjust their stances as inflation picks up, and should use macroprudential policies to contain credit growth, it said.\nAn abrupt change in global risk appetite, which could be triggered by an inflation surprise in the United States or an escalation of Sino-U.S. trade tensions, could lead to a sudden tightening of global financial conditions.\nTensions between the United States and China escalated earlier this year, when President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods to punish Beijing over unfair joint-venture and intellectual property practices.\nChina, which denies allegations it coerces technology transfers through these channels, has warned of retaliation, including tariffs on U.S. soybeans and aircraft.\nMeanwhile, assets from Asia’s three major economies running current account deficits - India, Indonesia and Philippines - have come under pressure in recent weeks following a rise in U.S. Treasury yields to 3 percent and a surge in oil prices to 3-1/2 year highs.\nWhile Asia’s rapid growth and improved external buffers “should help, the region remains vulnerable to a global risk-off event,” the report said.
