CYBG, which owns Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank, also rose, by 1.1 percent.\nShares in other mid-sized lenders Metro Bank and Onesavings Bank were lifted by the sign of long-awaited consolidation among Britain’s so-called challenger banks.\nHowever, shares in Sky fell 1.6 percent after U.S. cable operator Comcast formally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain’s pay-TV group, a source told Reuters.\nFirstgroup was the biggest mid cap faller, down more than 12 percent after U.S. private equity firm Apollo Global Management withdrew its interest to buy the Bus and rail operator.
