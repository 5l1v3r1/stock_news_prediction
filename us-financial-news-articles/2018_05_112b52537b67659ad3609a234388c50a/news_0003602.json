(NASDAQ: ANIK), a global, integrated orthopedic and regenerative medicines company specializing in therapeutics based on its proprietary hyaluronic acid (“HA”) technology , today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, along with business progress in the period.\n“In the first quarter, Anika saw strong growth in its most prominent product categories and continued to take the steps necessary to transform the Company into a fully integrated, global commercial organization,” said Joseph Darling, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anika Therapeutics. “Global MONOVISC revenue increased 29% year-over-year, and end-user demand for CINGAL in Europe and Canada remained strong in the first quarter. Together, MONOVISC and CINGAL global revenue grew 38% year-over-year. However, that growth was countered by soft ORTHOVISC revenue, non-recurring charges related to the planned CEO transition, and a voluntary recall of three HYAFF-based products.”\nMr. Darling continued, “We are rapidly advancing the CINGAL Phase III trial, with the completion of the 6-month patient follow-up in April. Our entire leadership team is energized and focused on delivering our new and innovative solutions to the market, accelerating our revenue and earnings growth in the years ahead, and creating sustained value for our shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $21.3 million, compared to $23.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decline was due in part to $1.1 million related to the voluntary, non-safety related recall of HYALOFAST, HYALOGRAFT-C, and HYALOMATRIX. Worldwide Orthobiologics revenue decreased $0.7 million year-over-year in the first quarter of 2018, due primarily to lower ORTHOVISC revenue. Global MONOVISC revenue increased 29% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2018, resulting from our international expansion efforts and the industry shift from multi- to single-injection therapies. International Viscosupplementation revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2018, due primarily to the global expansion of MONOVISC, as well as the growth of CINGAL in the international markets. Domestically, ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC achieved the number one position in the combined multi- and single-injection segments in the first quarter of 2018. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $29.1 million, compared to $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in total operating expenses was due primarily to a one-time charge of $8.4 million, which consisted mainly of non-cash stock-based compensation expense associated with the retirement of our former CEO. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.7 million, or ($0.46) per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The decline in net income was due primarily to the increase in operating expenses previously discussed.\nRecent Business Highlights\nThe Company made key commercial, pipeline and operational advancements, including:\nAppointing Joseph Darling as Chief Executive Officer and as a Director to succeed Dr. Charles Sherwood, who retired as Chief Executive Officer and a Director in March 2018. Mr. Darling joined Anika as President in late July 2017, bringing more than 20 years of extensive experience in executive management and leadership skills from publicly-traded, commercial-stage companies, including Abbott Laboratories, Baxter Healthcare, Smith & Nephew, CONMED, and Wyeth-Ayerst. Advancing its product pipeline with the completion of 6-month patient follow-up in the CINGAL Phase III study for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain in the knee, continued progress in the CINGAL 3-month extension study and the FastTRACK Phase III HYALOFAST Study for cartilage repair, as well as the Phase III MONOVISC study for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain in the hip. Continuing the development of a direct commercial capability in the United States to support the planned U.S. launch of CINGAL in 2019 and other new therapies in the years ahead.\nVoluntary Recall of HYALOFAST, HYALOGRAFT-C and HYALOMATRIX\nThe Company is undertaking a voluntary recall of certain lots of its HYALOFAST, HYALOGRAFT-C, and HYALOMATRIX products. While there is no indication of any safety or efficacy issue related to the affected products at this time, the Company remains committed to the highest standards of quality and is removing the products from the field as a precautionary measure. The recall is being initiated by the Company following internal quality testing which indicated that the products were at risk of not maintaining certain measures throughout their entire shelf life. All impacted distributors have been notified of the recall, and the Company is taking all appropriate actions with respect to applicable regulatory authorities. The Company is in the process of identifying and implementing the appropriate operational resolution of the underlying issue, and it expects to fully resolve the matter and resume production and shipping by the end of 2018. The HYALOFAST product being used to conduct the ongoing Phase III clinical trial was not impacted by the recall.\nThe voluntary recall negatively impacted the Company’s financial results for the first quarter of 2018 by $1.1 million in product revenue, $0.6 million in inventory reserves, and $0.4 million in administration costs related to the recall. HYALOFAST, HYALOGRAFT-C, and HYALOMATRIX revenue totaled approximately 3% of total revenue for the full year of 2017.\n“This voluntary recall is based on the Company’s commitment to the highest standards of quality for which we are known around the globe,” continued Joseph Darling. “While there is no indication of any impact on the safety or efficacy of the product at this time, we cannot accept any deviation from our stringent quality measures. Our quality and engineering staff are working diligently to resolve the issue in order to bring these products back into the hands of surgeons who have used the products to treat patients in need.”\nFull Year 2018 Revised Corporate Outlook\nBased on Anika’s first quarter 2018 results and currently available information, the Company revised its guidance for the full year of 2018. Anika now expects total revenue growth to be flat for the full year of 2018. Total operating expenses are expected to be in the high $90 million range for the full year of 2018, including the one-time charge associated with the retirement of our former CEO in the first quarter of 2018 and the expenses associated with CINGAL pre-launch activities required to support a successful direct commercialization in the U.S.\nConference Call Information\nAnika’s management will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss its financial results and business highlights tomorrow, Thursday, May 3 at 9:00 am ET.
