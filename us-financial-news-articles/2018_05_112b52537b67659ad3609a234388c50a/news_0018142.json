Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, adding back net loss from discontinued operations, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, acquisition and restructuring costs, write-off of long-lived assets, and litigation costs, as noted in the tables below. Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and the related basic and diluted per share amounts is a non-GAAP measure equal to net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, adding back the effect of spin-off transaction costs.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss $ (26,682 ) $ (12,725 ) Net loss from discontinued operations 21,124 2,893 Interest expense, net 2,394 2,227 Depreciation and amortization 3,331 3,205 Share-based compensation expense 6,648 6,854 Acquisition and restructuring costs 2,713 668 Write-off of long-lived assets - 3,626 Litigation costs 72 - Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,600 $ 6,748\nThree Months Ended March 31, (In thousands, except share data) 2018 2017 Net loss from continuing operations $ (5,558 ) $ (9,832 ) Add back: Spin-off transaction costs 7,708 - Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations $ 2,150 $ (9,832 ) Adjusted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations: Basic $ 0.03 $ (0.18 ) Diluted $ 0.03 $ (0.18 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding: Basic 67,311,784 53,811,688 Diluted (1) 70,226,701 53,811,688 (1) The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 is computed based on the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive impact of outstanding restricted stock units as of March 31, 2018.\nWe present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share as supplemental measures of our operating performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors as they eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use them as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure our performance, evaluate the performance of our senior management and measure the operating strength of our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share are measures frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and is an indicator of the operational strength of our business. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and write-off of long-lived assets. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share eliminate the effect of the spin-off transaction costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.\nContact Information:\nInvestors:\nJordyn Tarazi\nFluent, Inc.\n(646)356-8469\nJTarazi@fluentco.com\nMedia:\nNorth 6th Agency, Inc.\n(212)334-9753 ext. 143\nfluent@n6a.com\nSource:Fluent, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f8a4a019-4940-47cb-ba93-9ba9f2263d20", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xoeTZ6GtM78PESXITz5bidytAymyc76RCrGr9XTW36GlNC8otUHuZUeYnadQ5RYPC__YRnGBEofJvdNW__IgUg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1S2-9FMdq6vHdh_QFBiIzERPWHq5Yoiyu9oX-PzHsv3ttQxFwzP89V3j-cmO6Y9e9pNrrAXkkYUqZuoCNpEazQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1S2-9FMdq6vHdh_QFBiIzFXNlrLyzE_3a3WYdJTCziWnTg10z1GkRfRaaMRv8TJK8Hv79pCR-w4bGcMao-A9sw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vdS_7jbZvfA1Mw7qlIZvhlLYkVW_--1Cl4xEsKwVT8hUsBO5VC3V_609xkhY4rdAj2OeMEIZ7ml1bKbcxzzrghz_0x5D3KoraEZbFpLDm5A=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1S2-9FMdq6vHdh_QFBiIzDwJQeQdSdZlMUhYrIAhPwdgKQfiwd-9AxbcctoftK9E_l4Z3Sf8AFzhIYKlbpWf-w=="], "published": "2018-05-09T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T00:05:20.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
