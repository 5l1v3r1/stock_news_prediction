This compared to cash usage of $2.8 million for the same period last year. Based on preliminary unaudited financial statements for fiscal 2018, the company reiterates that it expects to report annual revenue of approximately $83 million, a 7% increase in revenue from its prior year. The company also reported a 1.3:1 book to bill ratio during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and cash usage declined 44% for fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year.\n“We are pleased to reiterate our preliminary financial results including that the company has returned to year-over-year revenue growth after three years of consecutively lower revenues. Additionally, our 1.3:1 book to bill ratio, which was the best in several quarters, and the recently announced 4 MW order to be shipped in the current quarter are strong indicators of continued revenue growth in our next fiscal year,” added Mr. Jamison.\n“We have an excellent foundation from which we will continue to build our momentum into fiscal 2019. Capstone entered the new fiscal year from a position of strength and focused on growth with a strong order booking, improved margins, lower operating expenses, an improving balance sheet and a more focused spend on marketing to drive sales. We are also seeing increasing benefits from our innovative aftermarket service businesses, which helps to build a predictable revenue base and drive margin expansion,” added Mr. Jamison.\nAs part of Capstone’s focus on marketing to drive sales, this week the company presented at the 50 th annual Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) held in Houston, TX, which is the oil and gas industry’s largest equipment exhibition show in the United States.\nAdditionally, the company has maintained its investor outreach initiatives throughout fiscal 2018 and has continued those initiatives into fiscal 2019 to increase transparency to shareholders and increase awareness of the company’s progress and product offerings. This outreach includes various avenues; press releases on new programs, non-deal roadshows, lunch and learns, attending and presenting at industry and institutional conferences and expanding its social media presence to include Mr. Jamison’s recently launched Twitter account (@Darren_Jamison) to provide accurate and timely information to the public.\n“We strive to provide customers, employees, shareholders and vendors with transparency and real-time information through various platforms, and I believe this level of clear and frequent communication is important for companies like Capstone that are dynamic, achieving new key business milestones and approaching potential business inflection points,” concluded Mr. Jamison.\nEBITDA is defined as net income before interest, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense.
