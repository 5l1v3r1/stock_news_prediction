Elovitch controls Bezeq through B Communications , a unit of his indebted Eurocom group.\nShareholders last week voted for a new board that removed Elovitch’s majority. Elovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was arrested along with a number of other officials connected with Bezeq. They all deny any wrongdoing.\nBezeq CEO Stella Handler was also arrested in connection with an investigation into alleged fraud, bribery and securities offences. She has denied any wrongdoing and plans to step down in July.
