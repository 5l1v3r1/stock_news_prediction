The lek stood at 137.28 lek to the euro at end-2015 and at 132.95 to the euro at end-2017.\nFactors behind the strengthening of the lek were fundamentals like a bigger supply of euros as a result of an improved current accounts deficit, higher levels of foreign direct investments and lower risks in the domestic financial market, Sejko said.\n“On the other hand, the relatively rapid strengthening of the lek over the last two months reflects the action of specific players in the foreign exchange market,” Sejko said.\n“This is not linked either to the direct effects or the goals of our strategy to stimulate the use of the national currency. As such, it is expected and evaluated to be short-lived,” Sejko said.
