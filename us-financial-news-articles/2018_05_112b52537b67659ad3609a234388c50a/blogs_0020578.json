How Asian economies will adjust to the new normal — i.e. higher interest rates in the world's largest economy — will have a significant domino effect on global markets, she said Friday.\nChanges in U.S. monetary policy are a constant source of uncertainty but Indonesia's economy — Southeast Asia's largest — is prepared to handle any changes with minimal disruption, she said. The Indonesian government is also reducing the budget deficit to ensure it has fiscal space to respond to any shocks, she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T13:45:03.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
