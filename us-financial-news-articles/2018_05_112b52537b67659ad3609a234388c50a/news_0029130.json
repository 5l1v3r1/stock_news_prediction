Production started there in 2017.\nChevron spokesmen were not immediately available to comment on the state’s inquiry.\nGorgon LNG is owned by Chevron, ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell, and Japan’s Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA. $1 = 1.3383 Australian dollars Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Christian Schmollinger", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T11:08:44.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
