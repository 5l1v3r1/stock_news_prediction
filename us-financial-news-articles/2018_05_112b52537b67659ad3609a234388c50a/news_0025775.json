We successfully grew revenues, improved margins and generated strong cash flows for the quarter. The strategic decisions we made during the second half of 2017 positioned us for a strong start in 2018. Customers continue to recognize our differentiated service offering and the efficiencies and reliability we deliver.”\nMr. Bender continued, “We decided to accelerate our capital expenditure program in 2018 as we noted increasing demand in our frac rental business. The timely production of these assets enhanced our first quarter results and positioned us for the rest of 2018. We continue to evaluate this market and the need for additional rental equipment.\n“I am optimistic about the balance of 2018, with activity supported by current oil prices and from the continued expansion of our Rental business,” concluded Mr. Bender.\nRevenue Categories\nProduct\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 (in thousands) Product revenue $ 58,926 $ 57,128 $ 33,038 Gross profit $ 21,860 $ 19,662 $ 9,843 Gross margin 37.1 % 34.4 % 29.8 % First quarter 2018 product revenue increased $1.8 million, or 3.1%, sequentially, driven primarily by greater sales volume of wellhead equipment during the first quarter. Gross profit increased $2.2 million sequentially with margins improving 270 basis points due to increased sourcing of product from Suzhou as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies. Cactus’ estimated market share was 26.4% for first quarter 2018 compared to 26.0% for fourth quarter 2017, while the U.S. onshore quarterly rig count averaged 948 rigs in first quarter 2018 compared to 900 rigs in fourth quarter 2017.\nRental\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 (in thousands) Rental revenue $ 29,145 $ 24,490 $ 12,975 Gross profit $ 16,969 $ 12,144 $ 4,702 Gross margin 58.2 % 49.6 % 36.2 % First quarter 2018 rental revenue increased $4.7 million, or 19.0%, sequentially, due to higher demand for frac valves and zipper manifolds, reflecting greater completions activity across the major U.S. basins in which the Company operates, as well as an increase in Cactus’ rental fleet arising from acceleration of its 2018 capital expenditure program during first quarter 2018. Gross profit increased $4.8 million sequentially with margins improving 860 basis points resulting from a combination of capacity additions, greater operating efficiencies and price.\nField Service and Other\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 (in thousands) Field service and other revenue $ 27,039 $ 23,166 $ 12,490 Gross profit $ 5,502 $ 3,575 $ 1,552 Gross margin 20.3 % 15.4 % 12.4 % First quarter 2018 field service and other revenue increased $3.9 million, or 16.7%, sequentially, due to increased billable hours related to installations. A higher percentage of the increase in hours related to frac service work, which requires greater service intensity. Gross profit increased $1.9 million sequentially with margins increasing 490 basis points due to improvement in billable hours compared to the fourth quarter when seasonal impacts and greater training hours compressed margins.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)\nSG&A for first quarter 2018 was $9.1 million (7.9% of revenues), compared to $6.6 million (6.3% of revenues) for fourth quarter 2017 and $6.1 million (10.4% of revenues) for first quarter 2017. The sequential increase is primarily related to $0.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s IPO as well as a combination of higher payroll, benefit and incentive compensation costs.\nSupplemental Information\nIf the Company’s GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.14 were adjusted for the following items, it would have been $0.34 for first quarter 2018: (i) the removal of interest expense on the term loan that was repaid in conjunction with the IPO; (ii) the removal of the loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of the term loan in conjunction with the IPO; (iii) additional stock-based compensation expense related to the period in 2018 prior to the IPO; and (iv) an adjustment to income tax expense to reflect the corporate effective tax rate assuming Cactus, Inc. held all units in Cactus LLC. The Company believes this supplemental information is useful for evaluating performance period over period. The table below sets forth additional detail regarding the adjustments.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 (in thousands,\nexcept per share data)\nNet income $ 26,408 Adjustments: Term loan interest, pre-tax (a) 2,284 Loss on debt extinguishment, pre-tax (b) 4,305 Stock-based compensation, pre-tax (c) (417 ) Income tax expense differential (d) (6,735\n) Net income, as adjusted $ 25,845\nDiluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 0.34 Weighted average shares outstanding, as adjusted (e) 75,096 (a) Reflects the removal of the term loan interest expense recorded during first quarter 2018 as the term loan was repaid in full in conjunction with the IPO.

(d) Represents the increase in tax expense as though Cactus, Inc. owned 100% of Cactus LLC beginning January 1, 2018, calculated as the difference in tax expense of $1.7 million recorded during first quarter 2018 and what would have been recorded, adjusted for the items in (a), (b) and (c) above, based on a corporate effective tax rate of 24.5%.\n(e) Reflects 26,450 shares of Class A common stock as though they were outstanding as of January 1, 2018, plus 48,440 additional shares as if the Class B common stock was exchanged and canceled for Class A common stock on January 1, 2018, plus the dilutive effect of restricted stock unit awards assuming issuance on January 1, 2018. Liquidity and Capital Expenditures\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash on hand of $7.9 million and no bank debt outstanding, resulting in total availability of $50.0 million under the Company’s revolving credit facility. In conjunction with the Company’s IPO, the outstanding term loan was repaid in full in February 2018. Operating cash flow was $38.6 million for first quarter 2018, generated from strong operating results and improvements in working capital intensity.\nNet capital expenditures for first quarter 2018 were $15.7 million. The majority of the spend related to the acceleration of production of rental equipment, particularly frac valves, as customer demand for higher intensity frac equipment continued to increase. The Company currently expects total capital expenditures for 2018 to range between $50 million and $60 million.\nCactus, Inc. IPO\nOn February 12, 2018, Cactus closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of Class A common stock. Including the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 15% of common shares, the Company issued a total of 26,450,000 shares of Class A common stock in the IPO at $19.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $469.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and current offering expenses, but not deducting $2.2 million in offering expenses paid by Cactus in 2017. Cactus contributed all the net proceeds of the IPO to Cactus Wellhead, LLC, its limited liability company operating subsidiary (“Cactus LLC”), in exchange for common units representing limited liability company interests in Cactus LLC (“CW Units”).\nThe Company caused Cactus LLC to use the net proceeds to (i) fully repay its outstanding term loan facility, plus accrued interest, of $251.0 million and (ii) distribute $216.4 million to certain of the legacy owners of Cactus LLC as part of the corporate reorganization undertaken in connection with the IPO. The remaining $2.2 million was held in cash. In addition, Cactus issued shares of its Class B common stock to each of the legacy owners who continued to own CW Units following the IPO. Following the IPO, there are 48,439,772 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding, which have no economic rights but entitles its holders to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Company’s shareholders generally.\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (the “TRA”) with certain direct and indirect owners of CW Units (the “TRA Holders”). The TRA generally provides for the payment by Cactus to the TRA Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that Cactus actually realizes or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances. Cactus will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these net cash savings. As of March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a liability of $63.0 million associated with the TRA as a result of the IPO.\nIn January 2018, Cactus made a $26.0 million tax distribution payment to legacy owners of Cactus LLC related to the tax liabilities incurred prior to the IPO. The payment was funded through the borrowing of $26.0 million under the Company’s revolving credit facility, which was repaid as of March 31, 2018.\nConference Call Details\nCactus will host a conference call to discuss financial and operational results tomorrow, Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 9:00 AM Central Time (10:00 AM Eastern Time).\nThe call will be webcast on Cactus’ website at www.CactusWHD.com .

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Cactus defines EBITDA as net income excluding net interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization. Cactus defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding (gain) loss on debt extinguishment and stock-based compensation. Cactus management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate the Company’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to financing methods or capital structure, or other items that impact comparability of financial results from period to period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Cactus presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business.

Cactus believes that comparing the total number of active U.S. onshore rigs to which it was providing its products and services at a given time to the number of active U.S. onshore rigs during the same period provides Cactus with a reasonable approximation of its market share with respect to wellhead products sold and the corresponding services it provides.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006542/en/\nCactus, Inc.\nStephen Tadlock, 713-396-5748\nVice President and Chief Administrative Officer\nIR@CactusWHD.com\nSource: Cactus, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006542/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CactusWHD.com&esheet=51803754&newsitemid=20180509006542&lan=en-US&anchor=www.CactusWHD.com&index=1&md5=5f05a331b53ed525dc55c73dba38b37e"], "published": "2018-05-10T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T04:01:01.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
