(NASDAQ:FRSH) today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended April 2, 2018.\nKey financial highlights for the first quarter of 2018 include the following (1) :\nRevenue was $34.8 million compared to $40.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Comparable store sales decreased 3.9% compared to the first quarter of 2017, including a 4.0% decrease at global franchise-owned stores and a 2.7% decrease at Company-owned stores. Selling, general and administrative expense was $13.0 million, including $6.3 million associated with gross expenditures at the Brand Fund, a litigation reserve of approximately $1.0 million, transition costs related to the Company's e-commerce platform of $0.3 million, and CEO transition and restructuring costs of $0.2 million. Reported Net Income was $1.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to a Reported Net Loss of $5.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the prior year first quarter. Pro-Forma Net income (2) in the quarter was $2.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to a Pro-Forma Net Loss of $3.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (2) was $7.1 million, compared to negative Adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million in the prior year first quarter. Franchise-owners opened four new stores in the quarter, all in the US market.\n(1) Please note that results reflect the first quarter adoption by the Company of two new accounting standards (ASC topic 606 – Revenue from contracts with customers, and ASC topic 842 – Leases). 2017 financial results have been adjusted to reflect the implementation of the standards. (2) Pro-Forma Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of Pro-Forma Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income/(loss) and discussion of why the Company considers Pro-Forma Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures, see the financial tables accompanying this release and the paragraph below entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Weldon Spangler, Chief Executive Officer of Papa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc., stated, “We are pleased with the progression of our strategic initiatives that we believe will stabilize near-term results and return this system to profitable growth. While comparable store sales declined in the quarter, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement of results, and by the positive sales in certain markets that have been early adopters of a set of marketing initiatives designed to improve brand relevance and customer value.”\nSpangler added, “Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement with an existing franchise-owner, Fresh Take, LLC, to refranchise our Company-owned stores in Colorado. We remain committed to return to upward of a 95% franchised system and are in active discussions to secure additional refranchising transactions.”\nKey Operating Metrics\nThree Months Ended April 2, 2018 April 3, 2017 unaudited as adjusted* Comparable store sales: Franchised stores (4.0 )% (4.5 )% Company-owned stores (2.7 )% (9.9 )% Combined (3.9 )% (5.0 )% System-wide sales ($’s in 000s) $ 213,757 $ 225,610 Adjusted EBITDA ($’s in 000s) $ 7,136 $ (2,345 ) Store Count Franchised 1,359 1,398 Company-owned 145 168 System-wide 1,504 1,566 * Prior year results have been adjusted to reflect the impact of adopting the new revenue (ASC Topic 606) and lease (ASC Topic 842) accounting standards effective January 2, 2018. The Company uses a variety of operating and performance metrics to evaluate the performance of the business. Below is a description of certain key operating metrics:\nComparable Store Sales represents the change in year-over-year sales for all comparable stores, including international. A comparable store is a store that has been open for at least 52 full weeks from the comparable date (the Tuesday following the opening date). As of the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, we had 1,469 and 1,472 comparable stores, respectively.\nSystem-wide Sales include net sales by all franchise owned and Company-owned stores.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) before interest expense, provision for (benefit from) income taxes and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments to reflect the elimination of various expenses that the Company considers not indicative of ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the financial tables accompanying this release.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to the end of the first quarter, the Company signed an agreement to refranchise the company owned stores across the state of Colorado, with an existing franchise-owner, Fresh Take, LLC. The cash flow generated from refranchising is expected to be used for debt pay-down.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nBased on current information, and reflective of the adoption of two new accounting standards (ASC topic 606 – Revenue from contracts with customers and ASC topic 842 – Leases) and the refranchising of the Company-owned stores in Colorado, Papa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc. is providing the following guidance for full-year outlook for fiscal 2018, which ends on December 31, 2018:\nFull-year system-wide comparable store sales are expected to be about flat for fiscal 2018 as compared to previous guidance of flat to low single digit growth; Domestic franchise new store openings of approximately 10 units; Full-year selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $50 million, including $23.8 million associated with gross expenditures in the Brand Funds, and excluding expected non-recurring costs totaling around $4.0 million; Adjusted EBITDA, of approximately $21 million; Cash Flow from Operations of around $7.4 million (net of expected legal settlements totaling approximately $5.0 million) and Cash provided by Investing Activities of approximately $6.1 million (which includes $7.1 million net proceeds from refranchising activities less approximately $1.0 million in capital expenditures); Full-year effective book tax rate of approximately 27.7%; and Diluted share-count of approximately 16.9 million.\nThe Company expects to update the financial outlook for the effects of additional refranchising when it has greater certainty around specific transactions and timing.\nConference Call\nPapa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter financial results on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company is also providing with this press release the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro-Forma Net Income are not derived in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income should not be considered by the reader as an alternative to net (loss) income (the most comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income). The Company’s management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro-Forma Net Income are helpful as indicators of the current financial performance of the Company because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro-Forma Net Income reflect the additions and eliminations of various income statement items that management does not consider indicative of ongoing operating results. We have provided reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income to GAAP net (loss) income in the financial tables accompanying this release.\nThe Company is also providing with this press release a forward looking estimate of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. We do not, however, provide a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying various adjustments that are necessary for this reconciliation and, accordingly, the reconciling information cannot be obtained without unreasonable effort.\nPAPA MURPHY’S HOLDINGS, INC.
