The cost of diesel oil has gone up in recent months as world oil prices have risen and the Brazilian real has weakened against the U.S. dollar.\nTruck owners also want some tolls reduced.\nThe Folha de S. Paulo newspaper said on Sunday that the strike has resulted in nearly $3 billion in losses since it began on May 21.\nPolice have cleared 132 of the 529 blockades truckers erected across the country, allowing trucks with emergency fuel supplies to reach army facilities and police stations.\n on Sunday met with members of his cabinet to discuss ideas aimed at bringing an end to the strike.\nOne proposal being discussed is a 10 percent discount on diesel prices for at least 60 days with the federal government compensating state-run oil company Petrobras for ensuing losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T00:28:14.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
