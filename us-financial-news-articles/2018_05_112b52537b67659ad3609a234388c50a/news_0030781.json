They have made me happy.”\nThe female master builders who made Lamwaka’s home - and gave her food, cooking utensils and bed sheets when her old one was destroyed - started working together about a decade ago as they struggled to recover from almost 20 years of war.\nThe women survived rape, abuse, forced labor and other horrors during an insurgency waged by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), when the army fought rebels notorious for cutting off people’s body parts and abducting children into their ranks.\nIn a war that ripped northern Uganda apart, some 2 million people - almost the entire population of the region - were forced into camps. The LRA was ousted from Uganda in 2005, retreating into South Sudan and neighboring states.\nToday, the 15 women builders live in neighboring villages in Paicho sub-county, some 350 km (217 miles) north of the capital, Kampala.\nThey support one another as a team, running a shared savings and loans scheme, as well as home-building projects.\n“These days, women can build houses so well on their own,” said Paska Akello, the group’s chair, another single mother who was kidnapped by the LRA when she was pregnant.\nABANDONED The idea to build homes came from Agnes Igoye, a women’s rights advocate who works as Uganda’s deputy national coordinator for the prevention of human trafficking.\nAs a child, the conflict forced Igoye and her family to flee their home, but in 2013 she returned to northern Uganda to help other victims of war.\nShe heard about a woman who had been kicked out of her home by relatives because her husband had been abducted and forced to become an LRA rebel.\n“She had three daughters – they would look for a place to sleep every night,” Igoye said. “I had never built a house in my life ... But I said that we, as women, have to do something about it.”\nShe persuaded the group, which had already formed, to venture into construction.\nNorthern Uganda is a society where gender roles are strongly defined, said Ryan O’Byrne, a research fellow with the London School of Economics, based in the region.\nWhile some women lost their husbands in the conflict, others got divorced or were simply abandoned. The men who are around are often unhelpful, spending their time drinking alcohol to soothe widespread post-war trauma, said Akello.\nNowadays, material hardship and social change brought by the war are pushing women to try less traditional roles and trades.\nThey have stepped up to run homes and their own businesses, often because they have no other choice, Akello said.\nNorthern Uganda, one of the country’s most marginalized areas, is plagued by unemployment, low levels of economic development and high rates of poverty.\nLack of land rights for women is another major problem, as access to land is usually passed down through the male line in Acholi culture. Women traditionally gain the right to live on, and farm, land owned by their fathers and husbands.\nAmid the conflict, which disrupted family units, many women lost the ability to access land or had it taken off them, noted O’Byrne.\nREBEL WIVES In peacetime, women across northern Uganda are getting together to protect their interests.\nFurther west of Paicho, a group of about 40 women - many of whom were abducted by the LRA, raped and then shunned by their families for returning with so-called “rebel babies” - set up their own community about seven years ago in Pida village.\nThey called it Waroco Kwowa, which means “Let us rebuild our lives” in the Acholi language.\nThe former “rebel wives” and other women who have joined them teach tailoring, craft-making, farming and business skills to a new generation of teen mothers in surrounding areas.\nUganda has banned child marriage, but nearly one in every two girls is still wed before the age of 18, according to the charity Girls Not Brides.\n“A girl in a village is likely to get pregnant and get married at 14 or 15,” said Annette Apiyo, one of the teachers, who was kidnapped aged six and forced to marry a rebel at 13.\nWhile the government has built new roads and upgraded infrastructure since the conflict ended, Ugandan official Igoye said many people lack entrepreneurial know-how and drive after years of reliance on wartime aid.\nHelping locals fend for themselves is the best way forward, she added.\nThe female builders are already planning their next project - farming the land of a member who is too weak to take advantage of the planting season.\n“We need to help so that she can have a good harvest,” said Lamwaka, as she began settling into her new home.\nMeanwhile, in the Waroco Kwowa community, some men have applied to join but only five were accepted who offer skills the women lack, Apiyo said.\nIn Paicho, the builders’ group admitted one man because he could read and write.\nBut he was fired when he ran off with 100,000 shillings ($27), after borrowing money he could not pay back.\n“We don’t need men because they can’t be trusted,” said Akello, the group chair, to laughter from her friends.\nFunding for this story was provided by the International Women’s Media Foundation\nReporting by Inna Lazareva, Editing by Megan Rowling and Katy Migiro.
