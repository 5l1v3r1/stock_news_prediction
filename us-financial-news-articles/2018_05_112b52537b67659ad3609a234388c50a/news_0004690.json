It is betting that customised viruses made at a giant new factory in Texas will be the lucrative raw materials of a medical revolution.\nLonza has said it was under no pressure to divest any of its businesses, including its lone consumer business, the HTH-brand swimming pool chemicals unit.\nBut it said on Friday it had hired an investment bank to advise on all strategic options for the Water Care division, whose restructuring, business model re-design and strategic review were continuing as planned.
