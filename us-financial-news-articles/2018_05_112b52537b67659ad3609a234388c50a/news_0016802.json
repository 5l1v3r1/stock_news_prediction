REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nRichemont — which already owns 25 percent of YNAP — in January offered up to 2.8 billion euros (2.5 billion pounds) for full control of the retailer to better compete in an expanding online market for luxury goods.\nNearly 94 percent of the shareholders targeted by the offer - or around 70 percent of YNAP’s share capital - accepted the bid by its deadline, preliminary data from the Italian bourse showed, taking Richemont’s stake in the company to just above 95 percent.\nThat is above the 90-percent threshold that triggers an obligation to buy out the remaining investors and de-list the group.
