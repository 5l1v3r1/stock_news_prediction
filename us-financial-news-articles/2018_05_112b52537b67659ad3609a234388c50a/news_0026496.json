Gorenje has said it has received three offers.\nAnother Chinese appliances maker Haier had offered about 10 euros per share and was considering increasing its offer, according to daily newspaper Finance, which cited unofficial sources.\n“I do not think the shares are going to go much higher before the takeover unless another company makes an even better bid,” Iztok Trobec from Dezelna Banka told Reuters.\nGorenje, one of the largest Slovenian exporters, said last year it was seeking a strategic partner to increase cost efficiency and strengthen the brand.\nHisense and Haier, which have both performed due diligence in Gorenje over the past weeks, were not available for immediate comment.
