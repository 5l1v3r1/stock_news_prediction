The Company expanded its royalty-bearing commercial license agreement with Tilray ® to include processing rights for cannabis in Portugal, and received a purchase order for a second 60kW Radiant Energy Vacuum (“REV TM ”) machine from Tilray ® to be installed in Portugal. EnWave also signed a Technology Evaluation and License Option Agreement (“TELOA”) with another top Canadian cannabis producer and granted the producer an exclusive option to license REV TM for processing cannabis in a country in Europe. These two agreements mark the initial expansion of EnWave’s proprietary dehydration technology into legalized cannabis markets outside of Canada, and the Company is pursuing an aggressive strategy to commercialize REV TM into the worldwide cannabis sector.\nDuring the second quarter, EnWave signed a new royalty-bearing commercial license agreement with Nomad Nutrition, and continued to expand its royalty partnership and machine sales pipeline through joint produce development projects under TELOAs with prospective partner companies in multiple verticals. Currently, the Company has 11 prospective royalty partners actively engaged in TELOA projects and a company in an advanced R&D agreement. EnWave’s strategy regarding these projects is to demonstrate the product innovation and attractive processing economics available through the use of REV TM technology.

EnWave has further developed patent-pending methods for uniformly drying and decontaminating cannabis through the use of REV™ technology, shortening the time from harvest to marketable cannabis products.\nREV™ technology’s commercial viability has been demonstrated and is growing rapidly across several market verticals in the food, and pharmaceutical sectors including legal cannabis. EnWave’s strategy is to sign royalty-bearing commercial licenses with industry leaders in multiple verticals for the use of REV™ technology. The company has signed over twenty royalty-bearing licenses to date, opening up nine distinct market sectors for commercialization of new and innovative products. In addition to these licenses, EnWave has formed a Limited Liability Corporation, NutraDried Food Company, LLC, to develop, manufacture, market and sell all-natural cheese snack products in the United States under the Moon Cheese ® brand.\nEnWave has introduced REV™ as the new dehydration standard in the food and biological material sectors: faster and cheaper than freeze drying, with better end product quality than air drying or spray drying. EnWave currently has three commercial REV™ platforms:\nnutra REV ® which is used in the food industry to dry food products quickly and at low-cost, while maintaining high levels of nutrition, taste, texture and colour;\npowder REV ® which is used for the bulk dehydration of food cultures, probiotics and fine biochemicals such as enzymes below the freezing point, and\nquanta REV ® which is used for continuous, high-volume low-temperature drying.\nAn additional platform, freeze REV ® , is being developed as a new method to stabilize and dehydrate biopharmaceuticals such as vaccines and antibodies.
