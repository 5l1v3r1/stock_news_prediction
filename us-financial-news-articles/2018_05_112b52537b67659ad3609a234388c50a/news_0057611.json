The plate number will then shrink into the upper-right corner.\nThose who choose to buy the new digital license plates can register their car electronically, eliminating the need to update the registration sticker each year.\nThe plates also feature a wireless communications system. That could make it easier to find a stolen car. Gizmodo reports that if a car is stolen, the plate will display the message “Stolen” and could be used to help both the owner and police locate the car—as long as the plate hasn’t been detached. Of course, some are already expressing concerns that the system would also allow law enforcement or even private companies to track the movements of the driver.\nNevertheless, Neville Boston, the founder of Reviver Auto , the plate’s manufacturer, suggests that they would likely be used for management of a company’s fleet of vehicles.\nBefore you get too excited though, the plates are expected to retail at a hefty price: $699 for the plate, not including installation costs. It does, however, come with its own computer chip and battery. The plates then incur a monthly fee of about $7. They are also not available directly through the DMV.\nWith the substantial price tag associated with the high-tech plates, it remains to be seen how widely they will catch on.
