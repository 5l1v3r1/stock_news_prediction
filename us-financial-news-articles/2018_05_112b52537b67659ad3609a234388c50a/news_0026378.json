The Departments of Defense and Interior have been holding meetings on drilling in the region that are likely to go on for months. A Defense Department spokeswoman did not immediately comment on whether those meetings were hammering out an agreement on drilling.\nIn the most recent Gulf of Mexico auction, held in March, many bids were made on acreage in the formation closest to the Military Mission Line known as DeSoto Canyon.\nBP Plc bid on the most contiguous leases of any participant anywhere in the Gulf, staking its claim on about 171 square miles in DeSoto Canyon, about 100 miles off the Louisiana coast.
