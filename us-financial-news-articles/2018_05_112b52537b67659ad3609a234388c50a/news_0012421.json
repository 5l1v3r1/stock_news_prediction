The kingdom depends far more on public employment than most other countries.\nPublic sector jobs account for nearly 35 percent of all employment and the wage bill alone absorbs 12 percent of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nReal gross domestic product declined by 0.7 percent in 2017, the first annual decrease since 2009, according to the IMF (“Regional economic outlook: Middle East”, IMF, May 2018).\nThe decline was because of a combination of lower oil production and the adverse impact of fiscal austerity on the rest of the economy.\nEXPENSIVE TRANSITION The government wants to shift the focus of the economy towards the non-oil private sector, but the transition will require enormous investment, even assuming it is eventually possible.\nEconomic transformation will need hundreds of billions of dollars, and financing can come only from the kingdom’s internal resources, or in the form of foreign loans, equity sales or direct investment.\nThe crown prince’s recent extended tour of the United States and Europe was intended partly as a roadshow to encourage foreign investment and partly to cement government-to-government alliances. But foreign investment on its own is unlikely to be enough, given the scale of the task and lingering concerns about the kingdom’s political direction and business environment.\nSo the country will need to find hundreds of billions of dollars from its own resources to complete the transformation programme and smooth the difficult transition.\nOfficial foreign assets amount to almost $500 billion and there are more held in various other government funds. But the kingdom needs to maintain a large cushion of liquid assets to ensure confidence in its fixed exchange rate against the dollar.\nAsset confiscations from wealthy Saudis and the nationalisation of domestic companies could raise extra funding but risk damaging investor confidence, so the potential for such measures is limited.\nAs a result, the kingdom badly needs to maximise oil revenues now to pay for the transition to a less oil-dependent economy in future.\nIronically, the desire to move away from petroleum dependence has made the kingdom even more reliant on oil in the short term. And the urgency of the reform process has turned it into the most hawkish member of OPEC on prices.\nRevenue requirements explain why the kingdom’s price policy has developed a clear upward tilt and why policymakers want to maintain OPEC production curbs for as long as possible.\nRelated columns:\n“Saudi Arabia eases austerity just as oil prices decline”, Reuters, June 21, 2017\n“Saudi Arabia will struggle to kick its addition to oil”, Reuters, April 27, 2016 (Editing by David Goodman)\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2rgRG3d", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:50:10.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
