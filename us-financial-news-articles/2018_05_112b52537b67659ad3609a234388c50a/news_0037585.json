The system will also cover imported electric vehicles.\nChina produced 150,000 new energy vehicles in the first quarter of 2018, up 157 percent from a year ago. Production reached 794,000 units last year, up 54 percent.\nThe total number of firms manufacturing new energy vehicles in China stood at 102 by March, with as many as 355 types of pure electric, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles in production.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:16:28.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
