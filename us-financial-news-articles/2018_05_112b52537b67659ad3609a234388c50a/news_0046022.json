It will show up in the months ahead,\" Glazer added.\nHe also noted the recent spike in crude oil prices are starting to filter through the economy, and will create inflationary pressures. Recent evidence suggests gas prices are on the rise ahead of Memorial Day.\n\"It will begin to affect consumers as the summer driving season kicks in,\" he added.\n'Put that money to work' Due to the emerging scenario, Glazer is advising investors to limit mega cap stocks and big tech exposure — groups that had been rallying as inflation and interest rates were at historic lows.\n\"It's about re-positioning portfolios — recognizing the new paradigm,\" he said, advocating a more domestic approach to investing right now.\nHe prefers small cap value , Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) , financials and energy . According to Glazer, they'll be the biggest beneficiaries of rising rates and an inflation comeback.\nIf this environment feels feels too unsettled , he points out there's always cash.\n\"A 2 percent money market sounds really great. It's actually outperforming a lot of areas of the stock market,\" Glazer said. \"As you get a bout of volatility later in the year, you can re-position. Put that money to work.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T00:19:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
