The closing date has not been set but it is expected to be sometime in June of 2018. Immediately upon closing, Lithium Exploration Group will receive a gross override from the ongoing oil production at the field, meaning that the company will begin consolidating cash flow in July as it begins its new fiscal year.\n“We are all very excited about this project on many levels. It will be amazing to have revenue coming in the door that will grow as the development drilling is initiated. We are also hoping to place a commercial-scale SonCav unit at the project, which will assist in the oil production and serve as a showroom for future sales of units to Canadian operators,” commented CEO Alex Walsh. “We have been fortunate to see oil prices rise steadily from their trough two years ago. Oil has already had its own industry recession during this bull market and we feel that prices will have a lot more resistance to any potential economic turbulence in the coming years and will provide great stability to our company as we go forward.”\nAbout Lithium Exploration Group\nLithium Exploration Group is a US-based exploration and development company focused on the acquisition and development potential of lithium brines and other precious metals that demonstrate high probability for near-term production.
