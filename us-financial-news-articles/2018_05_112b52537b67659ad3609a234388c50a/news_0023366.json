Billions of euros in writedowns booked by banks in recent years have eased disposals, which are now gaining steam helped by a recovering economy.\nBanco BPM said it would write down bad loans by 1.2 billion euros following the introduction this year of a new accounting rule requiring banks to book expected and no longer actual losses.\nThe bank said its net profit nearly doubled in the first quarter from a year earlier thanks to the sale of insurance assets to Cattolica Assicurazioni and a rise in its interest income, partly driven by the new accounting rule.\nFees instead fell 7.6 percent from the first quarter of last year, when Banco BPM was officially born from the merger of Popolare di Milano and Banco Popolare.
