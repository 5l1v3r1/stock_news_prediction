They will grumble and accept it. There is no one who will realistically choose Iran over the U.S.,\" said energy consultancy FGE.\n\"We believe the previous 1 million bpd limit for exports (imposed during previous sanctions) will be reimposed. As before, it may take several rounds of reductions to reach target levels,\" FGE's founder and chairman Fereidun Fesharaki wrote in a note. He added that condensate, a super-light form of crude oil that was excluded in the last round of sanctions, may well be included.\nDespite this, Fesharaki said the near-term impact on the oil market would be limited due to a 180-day wind down period as planned sanctions are implemented.\n\"But the impact will escalate as we approach November (i.e. the end of 180-day wind down period) ... Oil prices will certainly move up, and $90-100 per barrel prices may again be on the cards.\"\nSanctions come amid an oil market that has already been tightening due to strong demand, especially in Asia, and as top exporter Saudi Arabia and top producer Russia have led efforts since 2017 to withhold oil supplies to prop up prices.\nU.S. crude inventories <C-STK-T-EIA> fell by 2.2 million barrels in the week to May 4, to 433.76 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), slightly above the 420 million barrels five-year average level.\nOne factor that could prevent markets from tightening further is soaring U.S. oil output.\nWeekly U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> hit another record last week, climbing to 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd).\nThat's up 27 percent since mid-2016 and means U.S. output is creeping ever closer to that of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T10:09:32.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
