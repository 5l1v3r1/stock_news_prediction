Excluding performance of its garden business, though, comparable sales grew 6.5 percent, executives said on a conference call following the release of earnings.\n\"While spring was a reluctant bride, she has arrived,\" Chief Financial Officer Carol B. Tome said. \"Month to date, our May comparable sales are double-digit positive.\"\nHome Depot shares fell more than 1 percent in early trading.\nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:\nEarnings: $2.08 per share vs. $2.05 per share forecast by Thomson Reuters Revenue: $24.95 billion vs. $25.15 billion forecast by Thomson Reuters Same-store sales growth 4.2 percent vs. 5.4 percent forecast by Thomson Reuters In the quarter ended April 29, Home Depot said, net income rose to $2.40 billion, or $2.08 per share, from $2.01 billion, or $1.67 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to earn $2.05 per share.\nWhile revenue rose 4.4 percent to $24.95 billion from the year-ago period, it was below the $25.15 billion analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected.\nCustomer transactions during the quarter fell 1.3 percent, though shoppers spent an average of $66, 5.9 percent more than a year earlier.\nAnalysts at Jefferies last week lowered their first-quarter estimates for Home Depot, citing the poor spring weather. Jefferies expects shoppers will shift their projects to the summer rather than abandon them.\nMore broadly, Home Depot has been benefiting from a strong housing market and favorable economic tailwinds. Home improvement has been one of the strongest performing segments of retail, in part boosted by the recovery needed following severe weather over the past year.\nHome Depot has also been building out its e-commerce strategy, surpassing its rival Lowe's in that capacity. It told analysts Tuesday morning it added to its two-hour delivery program.\nHome Depot said Tuesday it is backing its previous forecasts for 2018. It has said it expects sales to rise roughly 6.5 percent and same-store sales to grow by about 5 percent.\nIt said that new rules regarding how it records its revenue will not materially affect its financial statements or disclosures. It will, though, change how it records revenue for its private label credit cards and gift cards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:57:29.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
