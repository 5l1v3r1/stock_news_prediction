The firm has since seen some pending deals collapse.\nThe firm has faced issues with regulators in several countries, concerned about its murky ownership structure. Capital control restrictions placed by Chinese regulators in recent years have also hit HNA’s deal activity.\nEarlier this week HNA dropped its bid for most of SkyBridge Capital, a hedge fund investment firm founded by U.S. President Donald Trump’s former aide Anthony Scaramucci, as the deal had been stuck with U.S. regulators for over a year.\nSince the start of 2018, the Chinese firm has agreed to sell over $10 billion worth of real estate in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, along with shares in Deutsche Bank AG, and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\nHNA Group saw its 2017 revenue jump over 200 percent to 594 billion yuan while net profit rose 80.41 percent to 2.63 billion yuan, the firm said in filings late last week. Its debt levels and borrowing costs have, however, also risen fast.
