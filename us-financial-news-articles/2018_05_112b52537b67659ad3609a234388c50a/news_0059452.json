REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo\nThe magazine last week flagged “big flaws” in the car, including braking slower than a full-sized pickup truck, while also highlighting many positives.\nTesla shares rose 2.5 percent to $290.80 on Wednesday after the report.\nThe Model 3 sedan is seen as crucial to Tesla’s profitability at a time when it is battling to reverse production shortfalls, confronting reports of crashes involving its vehicles and facing increased skepticism over its finances.\nThe update improved the Model 3’s overall score enough for a recommendation, said Consumer Reports, which had also raised other concerns such as the car’s wind noise, stiff ride and uncomfortable rear seat.\n\"Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month,\" Tesla Elon Musk said in a tweet here in response to the report.\nDuring the retest, Consumer Reports found that Model 3 stopped at 133 feet from 60 mph, matching Tesla’s earlier claims on the car’s braking distance.\nMusk had acknowledged the brake issue last week, saying that the magazine’s tests had used two early versions of the car and that a firmware update could improve braking distance beyond initial specs.\nJake Fisher, director of automotive testing at Consumer Reports, said he had never seen a car that could improve its track performance with an over-the-air update in his 19-year career at the magazine.\nConsumer Reports said it would test another Model 3, after Musk told the magazine that the electric car maker had already made changes to address the three other issues flagged in its initial report.
