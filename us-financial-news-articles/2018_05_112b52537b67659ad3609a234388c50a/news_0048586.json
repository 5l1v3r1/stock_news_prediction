Cricket - England Nets - Lord's Cricket Ground, London, Britain - May 21, 2018 England's Jos Buttler during nets Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nButtler returns to the test fold for the first time since December 2016 after a series of impressive innings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and he believes a similar bold approach in red-ball cricket can help cement his place in the side.\n“They’ve told me to play in the way people watch me play in white-ball games,” Buttler, a wicketkeeper selected as a specialist batsman for the Pakistan test, told a news conference on Monday.\n“I’m not just going to go out there trying to slog, but I’m going to try to be positive and score runs.”\nButtler’s time away from the test arena has seen him forge a reputation as an effective limited-overs player and he recently struck an IPL record-equalling five consecutive half-centuries for the Rajasthan Royals.

That’s what’s been asked of me really, to play in a way that suits me.”\nEngland will play two tests against Pakistan, with the second match at Headingley starting on June 1.
