A deal that could value the combined company at more than $20 billion could be announced as early as this week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. There is always a possibility that the deal talks, which center on using a tax-efficient structure called a Reverse Morris Trust, could collapse at the last minute, the sources cautioned. GE and Wabtec did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCorrection: The combined GE and Wabtec may be valued at $20 billion or more.
