REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Files\nComcast is racing to get ahead of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOXA.O ) in the battle to buy the European company, and the notification in Brussels is a key development. FILE PHOTO - The Sky logo is seen on outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nComcast, the world’s biggest entertainment company, stunned the industry in February when it made an informal 22 billion-pound ($30 billion) bid for Sky, taking on Fox which is in the final stages of its own bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.\nComcast made its bid formal in April and the notification in Brussels starts the clock on the regulatory review. It is keen to show Sky’s investors that it can get through the regulatory process quickly, unlike Fox which has faced repeated delays.\nThe Fox-Sky deal has been held up by concerns about the influence Murdoch could wield over public opinion through owning all of the broadcaster as well as British newspapers including The Times and The Sun.\nThe original combination has also been further complicated by Fox’s agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ), including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion (37.3 billion pounds).\nThe regulatory source declined to be named because the process is not public. Comcast declined to comment.
