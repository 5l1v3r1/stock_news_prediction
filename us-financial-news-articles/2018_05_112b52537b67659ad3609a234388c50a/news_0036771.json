REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo “Our judgment at the Dallas Fed is that we are either at or already past full employment,” Kaplan said at a local chamber of commerce event in Richardson, Texas.\nKaplan is currently in favor of two more interest rate rises this year, in line with Fed policymakers’ median estimate.\nThe U.S. central bank lifted borrowing costs in March and policymakers are split about evenly between those who expect another two rate hikes this year, and those who forecast three, amid low unemployment, moderate growth and rising inflation.\nThe unemployment rate is currently at a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent.\nReporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:10:51.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
