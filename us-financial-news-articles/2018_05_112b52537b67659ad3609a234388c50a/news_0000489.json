In six games against Miami this year, Franco has 13 RBIs.\nMarlins starter Jose Urena (0-5) continued his hard-luck season. He allowed seven hits, one walk and two runs, one earned, in seven innings. He threw 108 pitches, including a season-high 82 strikes.\nUrena, who went 14-7 last year, has not received a single run of support in his past two starts. He has three starts this season in which he has allowed one earned run in seven innings but has come away with two losses and a no-decision in those outings.\nPhiladelphia opened Wednesday’s scoring when Hernandez, the first batter of the game, pulled his homer to right-center. It was his third homer of the season.\nThe Phillies extended their lead to 2-0 in the second. Pedro Florimon pulled a two-out double down the left-field line. He scored when Urena, after fielding a comebacker from Nola, threw wild high to first base for Miami’s first error of the six-game homestand.\nPhiladelphia scored twice more in the eighth. Aaron Altherr hit a leadoff single and scored from first on Franco’s double. Franco took third on the throw home and scored on Florimon’s groundout.\nThe Phillies capped their scoring with two runs in the ninth on Odubel Herrera’s RBI single and Altherr’s sacrifice fly.\nThe Marlins made some decisions and moves before the game. Shortstop JT Riddle, who played 70 games for Miami as a rookie last year, was activated off the disabled list and sent to Triple-A New Orleans. He had been battling tendinitis in his right shoulder.\nIn addition, the Marlins sent catcher Tomas Telis to New Orleans after he cleared waivers, and Miami rested second baseman Starlin Castro, who had started the team’s first 29 games.\nThe Phillies rested rookie shortstop Scott Kingery, who was hit by a pitch on Tuesday. Marlins reliever Tayron Guerrero hit Kingery with a 98 mph fastball, which struck him on the right biceps.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:07:09.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
