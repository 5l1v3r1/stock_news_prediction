That rally ended in the first quarter of 2018 amid a trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China.\nCarlyle’s economic net income per share came in at 47 cents in the first quarter of 2018. This was ahead of analysts’ expectations for 26 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but down from $1.09 per share a year ago, when a buoyant stock market boosted investment returns.\nEconomic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Carlyle’s portfolio and is a closely-watched earnings metric for U.S. private equity firms.\n“We are benefiting from robust fundraising activity that is driving increased scale in our fund platforms and we remain on track to generate significantly higher fee related earnings by the fourth quarter of 2018,” Co-Chief Executives Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said in a statement.\nCarlyle said most of its funds generating performance fees appreciated by 3 percent on average, even as the S&P 500 index slid 1.2 percent in the first three months of 2018, the index’s first quarterly fall in 2-1/2 years. Peer Blackstone Group LP disclosed last week its private equity funds fared even better, appreciating by 6.4 percent in the quarter.\nBlackstone reported a 20 percent drop in economic net income per share last week, also beating Wall Street’s expectations.\nCarlyle’s distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - more than doubled from a year earlier to $139 million.\nThe Washington, D.C.-based firm was aided by investor appetite for alternative asset managers, with assets rising to $201.5 billion at the end of March, up from $195 billion at end-2017 and from which Carlyle will expect to earn stable management fees.\nCarlyle declared a distribution of 27 cents per common unit for the first quarter. This was the first time Carlyle reported quarterly earnings with Lee and Youngkin at the helm.\nCarlyle’s co-founders David Rubenstein and William Conway gave up their co-CEO roles last year to become co-executive chairmen. Carlyle’s other co-founder, Daniel D’Aniello, gave up his title as chairman but continues to sit on Carlyle’s board as chairman emeritus.
