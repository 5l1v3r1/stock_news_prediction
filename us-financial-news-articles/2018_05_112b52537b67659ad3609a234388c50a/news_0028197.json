Our interconnection is operating normally,” it added, without giving further details.\nMexico’s central bank said in April that it was investigating an apparent attempt to hack into the payment systems of at least three local financial institutions. No funds were stolen.\nAt the time, Mexican bank Banorte said “some clients saw a delay in executing transactions” after an “incident” affecting its connection to the central bank’s payment system.\nA central bank spokeswoman said on Friday that she had no information to give on Citibanamex’s problems, and referred Reuters to the bank’s April 30 statement.\nIn it, the bank said its SPEI interbank transfer system “had never been at risk,” but that “problems were detected in three institutions that used an application, provided by an external provider, that allows some participants to connect to the SPEI.”\nIn January, hackers attempted to rob the government-run export bank Bancomext, but officials said they were unsuccessful.\nSWIFT, the global messaging system used to move trillions of dollars each day, has been used by hackers to attack banks around the world, but the Brussels-based company has not disclosed the number of attacks.
