(TSX:SJ) (“Stella-Jones” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“First quarter results were in line with our expectations. Our railway ties category continued to face headwinds from pricing pressures, while sales in our utility pole product category increased on replacement programs and our residential lumber category benefited from an increased pricing environment. We continued to follow our strategy of continental expansion with two tuck-in acquisitions, which further reinforced the reliability of our production network and increased our distribution capabilities. Looking forward, we continue to expect sales and operating margins to improve progressively in 2018, when compared to last year, with operating margins stronger in the second half,” said Brian McManus, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFinancial Highlights\n(in millions of Canadian dollars, except per share data) Q1-18 Q1-17 Sales 398.8 396.9 EBITDA 43.4 49.1 Operating income 35.5 40.8 Net income for the period 23.1 25.9 Per share – basic and diluted ($) 0.33 0.37 Weighted average shares outstanding (basic, in ‘000s) 69,343 69,306 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS\nSales reached $398.8 million, an increase of 0.5%, when compared to $396.9 million for the same period last year. Acquisitions contributed sales of approximately $3.1 million, while the conversion effect from fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar, Stella-Jones’ reporting currency, versus the U.S. dollar, had a negative impact of $16.1 million. Excluding these factors, sales increased approximately $14.9 million, or 3.8%.\nRailway tie sales amounted to $146.4 million, down 7.6%, as compared to sales of $158.5 million for the same period last year. Excluding the conversion effect, railway tie sales decreased approximately $4.9 million, or 3.1%, primarily as a result of continued pricing pressures in certain regions and low railcar availability which limited shipments. Additionally, railway tie sales were impacted by lower sales from a Class 1 railroad customer which commenced the depletion of its inventory in preparation for a transition from a “treating service only” program to a full service “black-tie” program.\nUtility pole sales reached $153.0 million, up 1.3%, as compared to sales of 151.0 million for the same period last year. Excluding the contribution from acquisitions and the currency conversion effect, sales increased approximately $8.0 million, or 5.3%, driven by higher volume for replacement programs.\nSales in the residential lumber category totalled $50.3 million, up 30.3%, as compared to sales of $38.6 million for the same period last year. This significant increase is primarily explained by higher selling prices, as a result of higher lumber costs passed through to customers, and to a lesser extent, to increased volume.\nIndustrial product sales reached $20.8 million, down 5.2% as compared to sales of $21.9 million for the same period last year. Excluding the contribution from acquisitions and the currency conversion effect, sales decreased 2.6%, mainly due to the timing of projects related to bridges and timber.\nLogs and lumber sales amounted to $28.3 million, up 5.4%, as compared to sales of $26.9 million for the same period last year. This variation reflects higher selling prices due to increased lumber costs.\nOperating income stood at $35.5 million, or 8.9% of sales, compared with $40.8 million, or 10.3% of sales in the first quarter of the previous year. The decrease in absolute dollars is explained in most part, by the Company supporting the transition of a Class 1 railroad customer from a “treating services only” program to a full service “black-tie” program. To accelerate this transition, the Company acquired untreated railway ties from the Class 1 customer which increased cost of sales once these ties were treated and sold. Moreover, cost of sales was slightly impacted by increasing utility pole fiber costs which will be mitigated as selling prices will progressively be adjusted over the coming months. These cost increases were partially offset by the effect of currency translation.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, down from $25.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nACQUISITIONS\nOn February 9, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all the operating assets employed in the business of Prairie Forest Products (“PFP”), a division of Prendiville Industries Ltd. located at its wood treating facility in Neepawa, Manitoba, as well as at its peeling facility in Birch River, Manitoba. PFP manufactures treated wood utility poles as well as treated residential lumber. Total cash outlay associated with the acquisition was approximately $26.5 million. The Company financed the acquisition through its existing syndicated credit facilities.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENT\nOn April 9, 2018 the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all the operating assets employed in the business of Wood Preservers Incorporated (“WP”), located at its wood treating facility in Warsaw, Virginia. WP manufactures, sells and distributes marine and foundation piling and treated wood utility poles. Sales for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 were approximately US$34.6 million. Total cash outlay associated with the acquisition was approximately $27.5 million. The Company financed the acquisition through its existing syndicated credit facilities\nSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at March 31, 2018, the Company’s long-term debt, including the current portion, stood at $565.4 million compared with $455.6 million three months earlier. The increase mainly reflects higher working capital requirements, as per normal seasonal demand patterns, financing required for the PFP acquisition as well as the effect of local currency translation on U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. As at March 31, 2018, Stella-Jones’ total debt to EBITDA was 2.4x, up from 1.9x three months earlier.\nQUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.12 PER SHARE\nOn May 2, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per common share, payable on June 27, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nWhile operating margins will remain softer in the first half of 2018, we anticipate sales and operating margins to improve progressively in 2018. Railway tie sales should be relatively stable and softer pricing may further impact margins in the first half of the year, which should gradually return to historical levels by the end of the year. In the utility pole product category, while we anticipate a better sales mix in 2018, we expect it will be offset by slight cost increases for certain wood species and the timing of price adjustments. As for residential lumber, we expect to further benefit from continued demand for new construction and outdoor renovation projects in North America, while sales should also rise as pricing continues to reflect higher wood costs. Stella-Jones will also benefit from an overall lower effective tax rate of about 26.0%. In keeping with our proven capital allocation strategy, cash flow will be used to reduce debt, invest in working capital and our existing network, while sustaining an optimal dividend policy and exploring expansion opportunities that create lasting shareholder value.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nStella-Jones will hold a conference call to discuss these results on May 3, 2018, at 1:30 PM Eastern Time.
