He’s a fantastic player. If you slip off your game against him, he will punish you,” the Royal Challengers Bangalore player added.\nStokes did suffer a setback off the pitch when he was charged with affray following an incident in Bristol last September, costing him a place on England’s Ashes tour of Australia.\nThe player has pleaded not guilty and will face trial in August.\nHoping to help Stokes rediscover his best form, Rajasthan tried the middle-order batsman as an opener in Friday’s match against Chennai Super Kings but the all-rounder made just 11 before losing his middle stump to Harbhajan Singh.\nHowever, Rajasthan and England team mate Jos Buttler said the switch in order was primarily due to a hamstring issue.\n“(Rajasthan mentor) Shane Warne sort of said ‘why don’t you go at the top and play with some freedom and try and see if that comes off’ because he felt like he was going to find it hard in the middle with his running,” explained Buttler.\nBought at a relatively modest $680,000, Buttler has provided better value for money for Rajasthan, the wicketkeeper-batsman hitting his fourth consecutive half-century on Friday to keep the side alive in the playoff race.\nOpening the innings with Stokes, Buttler went on to smash an unbeaten 95 to anchor Rajasthan’s chase in Jaipur against IPL heavyweights Chennai.\nAsked if it was his best Twenty20 knock, the 27-year-old said, “Definitely, especially in the IPL. I have hit my straps and it’s always special when you’re not out.”\nRajasthan, currently sixth in the eight-team league, visit Mumbai Indians on Sunday.
