Located at 10 Post Office Square, the space allows for engineering, data science and marketing team expansions, which are being driven by the increased demand for ViralGains’ ad solutions. The company has recorded a three-year growth rate of over 500 percent, and now supports 25 of the Fortune 100, including four of the top five auto manufacturers.\n“Now, more than ever, we’re seeing overwhelming evidence that brands are dissatisfied with the current digital video advertising climate,” said Tod Loofbourrow, CEO, ViralGains. “According to the research we just published in collaboration with the CMO Council, 73 percent of marketing leaders are calling for total transparency into video traffic, viewers and engagement, and only three percent are satisfied with industry viewability metrics. They want to better understand the bottom-line impact of their campaigns, and they need good partners to help them. That’s what we’ve been doing here at ViralGains, and on the heels of our Series B funding last year we needed a bigger and more functional space that would accommodate the growth the market is demanding of us.”\nThe new office features an open floor plan with multiple collaborative work spaces to foster cross-departmental communication and enhanced innovation. This move reinforces ViralGains’ commitment to putting its team in the best position possible to lead the digital ad industry from an impression-based buying model into a future that instead focuses on deep consumer insights that drive high-impact business results. And the timing has never been better.\nAs Publicis Groupe’s Chief Growth Officer, Rishad Tobaccowala, recently said at a ViralGains event in Chicago: “The right metric for measuring video success has to be some outcome that takes you down the journey. I know there are beliefs that you can get messages through in two seconds. You can, but that’s only after you’ve built a brand long before then. I've never seen a brand built in two seconds. I think it’s much more engagement that matters—it’s definitely not impressions.”\nMoreover, the research referenced by Loofbourrow indicates that 78 percent of marketing leaders are increasingly held accountable for bottom-line metrics like sales, yet the vast majority are still measuring video advertising success with awareness-based metrics like clicks and impressions. Through its groundbreaking, interactive video technology, ViralGains is uniquely positioned to help marketers overcome this disconnect, as it enables brands and agencies to better target their ideal audiences, gain unique consumer insights and drive those consumers to take meaningful action. It’s an evolution the company believes is critical to the health and sustainability of the digital advertising ecosystem, and now, from its new headquarters, ViralGains is even better positioned to lead that charge.\nThis announcement follows the recent appointments of Vic Pierni as Chief Financial Officer and former AOL SVP Mark Connon to its Board of Directors.\nAbout ViralGains\nViralGains is a digital video ad journey platform that enables marketers to engage targeted audiences with relevant brand stories in the contexts they most favor. Using the platform to engage in two-way conversations, brands and agencies discover exactly what people want — and how they feel — and leverage those insights to build unique, full-funnel ad journeys that can generate increased awareness, motivate intent, and drive purchasing decisions. ViralGains is headquartered in Boston, with regional offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta and Detroit.
