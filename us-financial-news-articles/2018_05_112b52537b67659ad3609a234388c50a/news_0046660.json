He made 100 pitches and has reached that count in seven of his nine starts.\nBrad Hand pitched the final 1 1/3 innings for his 13th save.\nPittsburgh’s Ivan Nova (2-4), who has not picked up a win since April 15 (three losses, three no-decisions), gave up three runs (two earned) and six hits, with four strikeouts and no walks. He has allowed three runs or fewer in 19 of his 21 starts at PNC Park with the Pirates and has pitched at least six innings in 15 of those games.\nPirates center fielder Austin Meadows, making his major league debut with Starling Marte going on the 10-day disabled list because of a right oblique strain, was 2-for-4 with two singles and a stolen base.\nThe Pirates opened the scoring in the first. Adam Frazier and Gregory Polanco walked with no outs, and Frazier moved to third on Corey Dickerson’s double-play grounder. Josh Bell followed with an RBI double off the wall in left to make it 1-0.\nPittsburgh added a run in the third when Dickerson’s RBI single brought in Frazier, who again had walked and moved to second on a groundout.\nThe Padres tied it in the fourth. Travis Jankowski led off with a single and stole second. An out later, Hosmer hit an RBI double. Hosmer went to third when Cordero reached on Nova’s fielding error and scored on Raffy Lopez’s groundout to make it 2-2.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:35:09.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
