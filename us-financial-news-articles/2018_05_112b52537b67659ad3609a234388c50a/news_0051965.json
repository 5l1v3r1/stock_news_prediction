They then convince the businesses on the other line to pay them for services that are related to Google's free business listings .\nBeyond the legal route, Google is also rolling out new tools to help it identify and take action against accounts tied to scams and to educate business owners on how to identify bad actors.\nThis issue is related to another problem that Google is having with Maps, which critics say is being plagued by fraudulent listings and fake reviews .\nA Google representative has not responded to an inquiry as to whether the company's new tools will help identify chains of fake reviewers and listings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:53:48.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
