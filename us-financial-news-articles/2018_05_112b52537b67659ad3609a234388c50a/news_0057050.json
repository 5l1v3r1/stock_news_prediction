(NASDAQ:ECOL) (“the Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors has completed the annual review of the Company’s capital allocation priorities. As part of this review, the Board approved the extension of the Company’s $25 million stock repurchase program, which was set to expire on June 6, 2018. The Board also reaffirmed its commitment to the Company’s quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share for 2018.\nJeff Feeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The Company’s strong cash flow generation has allowed us to reduce our debt, strengthen our balance sheet and provide capacity for ongoing growth investments. As we look ahead, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize organic growth initiatives as well as high quality, strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our business. The Board has also reaffirmed its commitment to the dividend. Finally, the extension of the repurchase program provides additional opportunity to deploy capital through stock purchases.”\nThe Company’s stock repurchase program allows for purchases to be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing of any purchases will be based upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. With the extension, the program will now remain in effect until June 6, 2020, unless further extended by the Board of Directors. The share buyback program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Funding for this program could come from available corporate funds, including cash on hand, revolving credit facility borrowings and future cash flows.\nABOUT US ECOLOGY, INC.\nUS Ecology, Inc. is a leading North American provider of environmental services to commercial and government entities.
