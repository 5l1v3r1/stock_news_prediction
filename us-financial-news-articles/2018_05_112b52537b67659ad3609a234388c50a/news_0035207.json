Online sales, which account for about one twentieth of total sales, surged 49 percent.\nMyer added that British retail veteran John King, who it hired after sacking its previous leader in February following a series of profit warnings, would start on June 4.\n“John has been given a full mandate by the board to deliver an improvement in the company’s financial performance,” Executive Chairman Garry Hounsell said in a statement.\nMyer shares jumped, trading 14 percent higher at 42.8 Australian cents in afternoon trade, although they were still less than half their value a year ago and a tenth of their 2009 issue price. The broader market was up about 0.5 percent.\n“The market’s reacting strongly (but) the share price is still a long way from where it was six months ago,” said Johannes Faul, an analyst at Morningstar.\nShareholders are concerned the company will breach a debt facility if its sales fall much further, and want a clearer explanation of its strategy, Faul added.\nIn March, soon after ousting its CEO, Myer posted its biggest half-yearly loss since listing as it wrote off underperforming assets.\nOn Wednesday, the company blamed an unseasonably warm start to the Australian winter for continued the sales decline. The company also blamed warm winters for missing sales forecasts in 2016 and 2014.\nThe update prompted a rebuke from Myer’s biggest shareholder, retail veteran Solomon Lew who holds 10.7 percent, who said its discounting had “failed to arrest its sales decline” and would likely result in another profit warning.\n“Myer has been selling dollar notes for 50 cents and it’s still not working to improve sales, but shareholders will yet again be left to pick up the tab when Myer announces its disastrous full year loss,” said Lew who has led a revolt against its board.\nMyer declined to comment on Lew’s statement.\n($1 = 1.3387 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Byron Kaye in SYDNEY and Aaron Saldanha and Aditya Soni in BENGALURU; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:21:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
