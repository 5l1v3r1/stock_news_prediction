Under the agreement, the state will provide a sum of money to them, and funds for the repatriation of ancestral bones.\n“It’s significant, as it is an acknowledgement that we are the original custodians of the land,” said Lewis O’ Brien, a Kaurna elder and one of the applicants on the claim.\n“Otherwise, it was as though we did not exist.”\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
