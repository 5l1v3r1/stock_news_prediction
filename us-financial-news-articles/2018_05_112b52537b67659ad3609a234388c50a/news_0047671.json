But it hopes to boost the portion of income earned from recurring businesses, which consist of hospitality and office properties, in the future.\n“With the project of Outrigger acquisitions, with the project of Crossroads, it will put us in the balance mode by next year,” said Thongbenjamas, referring to a hotel project being built on reclaimed land over nine islands in the Maldives.\nThe first phase of the project will open in November, said Thongbenjamas, who is also the chief operating officer of the development.\nHe estimated the entire project would require an investment of $680 million, adding that other companies were interested in partnering with Singha for the project.\nThe company, which plans to list its hospitality business, S Hotels and Resorts, in 2019, is in discussion with banks over the initial public offering. Besides acquisitions, the company could look to build more greenfield projects after the listing, Thongbenjamas said.
