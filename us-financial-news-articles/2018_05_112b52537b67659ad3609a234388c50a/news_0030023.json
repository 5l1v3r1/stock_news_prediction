(“3PEA” or the “Company) (OTCQB:TPNL), a vertically integrated provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue increased 46% to a record $4.6 million compared to $3.2 million in the same year ago quarter. Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased to $2.24 million compared to $1.36 million in the same year ago quarter. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $412,548, or $.01 per share, compared to net income of $369,394, or $.01 per share, in the same year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $795,987 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $640,162 in the same year ago quarter (a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income is set forth below). Surpassed 1,700,000 PaySign ® Cardholders participating in 217 card programs as of March 31, 2018, up from approximately 1,550,000 cardholders participating in 205 programs for the period ended December 31, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\n“We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were both within our expectations and reflect the seasonality we commonly experience in the first quarter,” said Mark Newcomer, Chief Executive Officer, 3PEA International. “In recent months, we added several highly talented team members to our sales and marketing, operations, compliance, and customer service departments. Our expanded sales and marketing team has produced a strong pipeline, and results are just starting to be realized. Additionally, we appointed four highly respected independent directors to our board, whose diverse talents, experience and expertise will be relied upon as we continue to grow our Company.”\n“The increase in revenue in the first quarter was primarily a result of growth in our cardholder base throughout our prepaid programs,” said Brian Polan, Chief Financial Officer, 3PEA International. “We experienced a significant improvement in gross margins as a result of reductions in cost and the addition of higher margin programs. We expect our revenue to continue to grow at comparable rates as we bring higher margin card products to market.”\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $4,676,320, an increase of $1,475,425, or 46%, compared to the same period in the prior year, when revenues were $3,200,895. The increase in revenue is due to growth of our cardholder base. As of March 31, 2018, we managed 217 card programs with over 1,700,000 participating card holders. The company expects revenues to continue to trend upwards in the long term.\nGross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2,243,110, or 48% of revenue, an increase of $875,764 compared to the same period in the prior year, when gross profit was $1,367,346, or 43% of revenue.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1,579,019, an increase of $764,742 compared to the same period in the prior year, when selling, general and administrative expenses were $814,277. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the expansion of our compliance, technology, customer service, operations, and sales and marketing departments in order to successfully scale our business. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $795,987, an increase of $155,825 compared to the same period in the prior year, when Adjusted EBITDA was $640,162. Adjusted EBITDA increased in the current quarter, despite a substantial increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from the same period in the prior year, as increases in revenues and gross margins more than offset such increased expenses.\nOur net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $412,548, or $0.01 per share, an increase of $43,154 compared to the same period in the prior year, when we recorded net income of $369,394, or $0.01 per share. The increase in our net income is attributable to the aforementioned factors.\nShareholder Update\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we expanded our compliance, operations, technology and sales and marketing departments. In 2018 we will continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on increasing our footprint in corporate incentive, rebate and healthcare related card programs. In addition, we will offer a fully reloadable prepaid card option to our existing cardholder base. At of the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company has over 1.7 million PaySign Cardholders participating in 217 card programs.\nIn 2018, the Company added four independent non-executive directors:\nBruce A.

Non-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement 3PEA’s financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of net income that excludes the following cash and non-cash items – interest, taxes, stock-based compensation, amortization and depreciation. We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better evaluate our past financial performance and potential future results. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP accounting and investors should read them in conjunction with the company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures of net income we use may be different from, and not directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n“EBITDA” defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. “Adjusted EBITDA” reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude stock-based compensation charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows from operations, operating income (loss) or net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP as indicators of operating performances. Management cautions that amounts presented in accordance with 3PEA’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to 3PEA International, Inc.\n$ 412,548 $ 369,394 Income tax expense - 3,000 Interest expense - - Depreciation and amortization 246,038 215,267 EBITDA $ 658,586 $ 587,661 Stock-based compensation $ 137,401 $ 52,501 Adjusted EBITDA $ 795,987 $ 640,162\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005394/en/\n3PEA International, Inc.\nBrian Polan, 1-702-749-7234\nChief Financial Officer\nbpolan@3pea.com\nwww.3pea.com\nSource: 3PEA International, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F3Pea_Intl_Inc&esheet=51805552&newsitemid=20180514005394&lan=en-US&anchor=Twitter&index=4&md5=cac036d3088bda6f24f61597d7cbb67e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.3pea.com&esheet=51805552&lan=en-US&anchor=www.3pea.com&index=6&md5=9aea8480f43d47e8cc066b484676f51f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.otcmarkets.com%2Fstock%2FTPNL%2Fquote&esheet=51805552&newsitemid=20180514005394&lan=en-US&anchor=OTCQB%3ATPNL&index=1&md5=046c4415cb0d55baffbdd7b2e3e6c768", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2F3pea-international-inc.&esheet=51805552&newsitemid=20180514005394&lan=en-US&anchor=LinkedIn&index=3&md5=22ea1d4d6650a3e062253177862a3af9", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F3PeaInternational&esheet=51805552&newsitemid=20180514005394&lan=en-US&anchor=Facebook&index=5&md5=fa0ffddddd9a9363c6f97de40a2d508f", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005394/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.3pea.com&esheet=51805552&newsitemid=20180514005394&lan=en-US&anchor=www.3pea.com&index=2&md5=1b5c7a3a530e92fa3771f26619e66036"], "published": "2018-05-14T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T17:13:11.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
