The government expects the economy to expand by 5.1 percent this year, boosted by exports and investments.\nSome of the biggest banks are still state-owned and the government controls about 40 percent of the banking sector.\nThe rest are mostly owned by foreign banks and investors, including US investment firm Apollo Global Management, France’s bank Societe Generale, Italy’s Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, Russia’s Sberbank and Austria’s Sparkasse and Addiko Bank.
