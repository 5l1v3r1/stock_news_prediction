Across the region, other major markets such as Mexico and Brazil also saw their equities and currencies markets jump, supported by a solid day on Wall Street, oil prices that remain high in the face of fresh U.S. sanctions on Iran, and a slew of positive corporate earnings reports. Argentina's Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne was set to meet with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde in Washington after meeting on Wednesday with IMF Western Hemisphere Director Alejandro Werner. Finance Minister Luis Caputo said the IMF deal would guarantee financing through the end of President Mauricio Macri's first term in December 2019 at a \"very good\" interest rate of around 4 percent. On Wednesday, Argentina's Congress passed a capital markets reform bill, seeking to boost the economy by reducing the power of market regulators and loosening restrictions on some funds investing in the country. \"After the announcement to request financial help from the IMF ... local stocks were able to take a breather after the recent downturn and rebounded, taking advantage of the approval of the capital markets law,\" said Gustavo Ber, a partner at Buenos Aires consultancy Estudio Ber. Argentina's benchmark Merval index climbed around 6 percent on Thursday, after rising a similar amount on Wednesday. That followed a 12 percent rout over the previous 12 sessions. Energy stocks in particular helped support the index, after crude oil prices rose, triggered by potential disruption to oil flows from major exporter Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. While oil prices moderated amid profit booking on Thursday, prices remain high. In Brazil, where the Bovespa index gained 1.74 percent, shares in state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA jumped 3.91 percent after Bank of America elevated its rating on the stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral.\" The MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index, which puts together a cross-section of large- and mid-cap stocks from five major economies in the region, climbed 2.75 percent.
