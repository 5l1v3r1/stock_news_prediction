Vice President Mike Pence will also speak at the event.\nIt’s likely that all major news channels will air the speech, but if you’re not near a TV, it’s still possible to monitor Trump’s talk. The White House will stream the speech on its YouTube channel , with coverage starting at 12:10 p.m. ET. Trump is expected to begin speaking around 1:45 p.m. ET.\nTrump is a Second Amendment advocate who revoked Obama-era gun checks for the mentally ill, and famously said at last year’s NRA convention, “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.”\nThe political stakes are different now, though. After the Parkland shootings earlier this year, Trump faced criticism for his suggestion that teacher carry concealed weapons . Later, he accused a Republican senator of being “ afraid of the NRA ” and said he would stand up to the group.\nBut Trump tends to go off script in front of friendly crowds, so while the rights of gun owners are certain to be touched upon, it’s just as likely he will stray to other favorite talking points, such as lambasting the media and Democratic opponents.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAF56X9y34w", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZAF56X9y34w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/us/politics/ap-us-trump-nra.html"], "published": "2018-05-04T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T20:49:54.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
