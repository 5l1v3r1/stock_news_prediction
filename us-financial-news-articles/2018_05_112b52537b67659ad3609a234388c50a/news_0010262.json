The FAA's investigation found the crew inadvertently switched from the San Francisco tower frequency to a ground frequency after receiving landing clearance.\nThe FAA determined that on Feb. 15, 2017, a traffic controller mistakenly cleared a Compass passenger jet lo land on a runway where a Virgin America plane was waiting for take-off.\nTwo months earlier, on Dec. 14, 2016, a SkyWest pilot was given taxiing instructions and correctly read them back but then turned onto the wrong taxiway. The aircraft stopped 65 feet from the runway edge, where a United Airlines Boeing 737 was taking off.\nThe airport, which many pilots say is notoriously difficult for landings, has been under more scrutiny since July 8, when an Air Canada jet was descending toward a taxiway holding four other loaded planes rather than the assigned runway and narrowly avoided disaster.\nThe investigation led by the National Transportation Safety Board is ongoing.\nSince then, the airport has reinforced its ground radar system and shut down a confusing taxiway, the FAA said.\nThe report findings were first reported by the Mercury News in San Jose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T21:54:42.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
