But Kimberly-Clark de Mexico is the leader in the market of personal hygiene products in Mexico, according to the company’s website.\nA stock analyst, who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak with media, said the Cofece news was hitting Kimberly-Clark shares since it was the only listed company that made such products.\nKimberly-Clark de Mexico said in a filing with the Mexican stock exchange that it was cooperating with investigators and “acting in strict compliance with the law and its own code of conduct.”\nCofece can often take more than two years to complete investigations once they are opened.
