(NASDAQ:GPRE) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Net loss attributable to the company was $24.1 million, or $(0.60) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared with net loss of $3.6 million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, for the same period in 2017. Revenues were $1.0 billion for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $887.7 million for the same period last year.\n“Margins were weak in the first quarter, yet we expect demand for ethanol to improve domestically and internationally as we enter summer driving season,” commented Todd Becker, president and chief executive officer. “As we indicated in February, we limited production due to weak ethanol margins as well as major capital improvements at our plant in Madison, Illinois. We achieved a record yield of 2.89 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn as a result of our efforts to continue driving efficiency in our ethanol production processes. While we had another solid performance from our food and ingredients segment, which produced $16 million of EBITDA during the quarter, the company’s first quarter financial performance did not meet our expectations.”\n“Margins remained volatile even though the industry exported over 500 million gallons of ethanol in the first quarter, keeping exports on pace for another record year in 2018 and industry stock levels lower than each of the two previous years during the same time period,” Becker added. “We anticipate domestic ethanol blending will grow this year as a result of increased gasoline demand, the ethanol price discount to wholesale gasoline and continued effort by the industry to sell E15 year-round.”\n“We are also pleased to announce that we signed a Letter of Intent to implement, subject to final negotiations, Fluid-Quip Process Technologies’ patented Maximized Stillage Co-Products™ (MSC) System,” said Becker. “This proven bolt-on technology produces high-protein animal and fish feed ingredients from a portion of distillers grains and is expected to provide a consistent uplift of at least 10 cents per gallon to the ethanol margin structure. After the careful evaluation of several technologies, we are excited to choose Fluid-Quip’s MSC for our first implementation at Shenandoah, Iowa. As we have indicated in the past, we believe the margin contributions of corn oil and high-protein feed ingredients will help our returns become more predictable and consistent over time.”\nPortfolio Optimization Program\nGreen Plains also announced its intention to reposition its assets over the next several years to drive improved margins and returns for its shareholders as part of its Portfolio Optimization Program. This effort will include divestment of assets that do not support the long-term objectives of the company. This will result in a more efficient asset base focused on enhanced protein production and export supply chain maximization.\n“We have built a platform whose intrinsic value is not reflected in our market valuation,” continued Becker. “To remedy this, we intend to optimize our portfolio. Our primary goals are to improve our share price and significantly reduce our debt levels.”\nThe Program’s five strategic objectives include:\nProve value of Green Plains’ assets for our shareholders through strategic divestments Significantly reduce or eliminate term debt by the end of 2018 with sale proceeds Invest in high-protein process technology at the Shenandoah, Iowa ethanol facility with other locations to follow Repurchase shares with remaining proceeds and free cash flow when market conditions are optimal Reduce controllable expenses $10 to $15 million on an annual run rate basis, starting in the third quarter of 2018\n“Future investments will be focused on protein production, streamlining our export supply chain to leverage our strong position and maximizing our returns at our export facility in Beaumont, Texas,\" said Becker. “Assets that do not align with these goals will be divested to fund our capital needs in support of this strategy.” The company has retained XMS Capital Partners as the lead advisor, and Ocean Park to manage the process of certain assets.\n“While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act proved favorable to 2017 results, companies that process and handle commodities like us carry significant working capital and debt balances, which can potentially have negative tax implications going forward,” explained Becker. “By reducing our overall debt and realizing gains on asset sales at a lower corporate rate, we believe we are taking the appropriate steps under the new tax law that will benefit our shareholders long term and provide greater financial flexibility to execute future strategic initiatives.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments\nDuring the quarter, Green Plains and Green Plains Partners agreed to extend the offer period related to the company’s interest in the joint venture with Jefferson Ethanol Holdings LLC to no later than October 15, 2018.\nOn May 7, 2018, Green Plains announced it will divest assets that do not support the company’s strategic focus on the production of high-protein feed ingredients and ethanol exports to significantly reduce or eliminate the company’s term debt and invest in high-protein process technology at certain ethanol facilities.\nResults of Operations\nGreen Plains produced 280.4 million gallons of ethanol during the first quarter of 2018, compared with 326.4 million gallons for the same period in 2017. The consolidated ethanol crush margin was $15.3 million, or $0.05 per gallon, for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $37.7 million, or $0.12 per gallon, for the same period in 2017. The consolidated ethanol crush margin is the ethanol production segment’s operating income before depreciation and amortization, which includes corn oil, plus intercompany storage, transportation and other fees, net of related expenses.\nConsolidated revenues of $1,045.3 million increased $157.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of the cattle feedlot acquisitions during the first half of 2017 and higher natural gas volumes sold, partially offset by decreased volumes and lower average realized prices for ethanol, grain and corn oil.\nOperating loss of $3.9 million decreased $21.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period last year primarily due to lower ethanol margins. Interest expense increased $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased borrowings for the cattle feedlot acquisitions. Income tax benefit was $6.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $2.4 million for the same period in 2017.\nEarnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.1 million compared with $43.8 million for the same period last year.\nSegment Information\nThe company reports the financial and operating performance for the following four operating segments: (1) ethanol production, which includes the production of ethanol and distillers grains, and recovery of corn oil, (2) agribusiness and energy services, which includes grain handling and storage, commodity marketing and merchant trading for company-produced and third-party ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, natural gas and other commodities, (3) food and ingredients, which includes cattle feeding, vinegar production and corn oil operations and (4) partnership, which includes fuel storage and transportation services. Intercompany fees charged to the ethanol production segment for storage and logistics services, grain procurement and product sales are included in the partnership, and agribusiness and energy services segments and eliminated upon consolidation. Third party costs of grain consumed and revenues from product sales are reported directly in the ethanol production segment.\nGREEN PLAINS INC.

Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors for comparison with peer and other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or segment operating income, which are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, the company’s computation of EBITDA, segment EBITDA and consolidated ethanol crush margins may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of another company.\nAbout Green Plains Inc.\nGreen Plains Inc.
