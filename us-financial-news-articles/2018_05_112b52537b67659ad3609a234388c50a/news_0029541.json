(NASDAQ: CTWS) (“Connecticut Water”). The letter, which is included below, urges stockholders to consider the facts regarding SJW Group’s merger of equals with Connecticut Water.\nDear Fellow Stockholders,\nWe are excited about the progress we have made towards completing the merger of equals with Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (“Connecticut Water”), which is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2018. We have already achieved significant momentum toward closing, including important federal anti-trust clearance, the filing of our applications with Connecticut and Maine public utility regulators, and progress in merger integration and transition planning. Our combined company will have the scale, geographic diversity, and financial strength to deliver what we believe will be immediate and long-term value to our stockholders .\nIn the near future, you will be asked to vote at a Special Meeting of Stockholders to support our merger with Connecticut Water. This proposed combination of our two companies deserves your support. In addition to generating attractive value for stockholders, the merger will provide significant benefits to customers, all employees and the communities that we serve.\nAs you might have heard, California Water Service Group (“Cal Water”) has made an unsolicited, non-binding indication of interest to acquire our company for $68.25 per share in cash. Our Board of Directors carefully evaluated the non-binding indication and unanimously rejected it as neither a superior proposal nor reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal. The Board also unanimously reaffirmed its commitment to the merger of equals with Connecticut Water. Now, Cal Water has embarked upon an expensive and ill-advised campaign to break up our merger of equals by asking you to vote against the transaction.\nHere are the facts.\nOur merger of equals with Connecticut Water offers meaningful opportunities to generate not only immediate shareholder value, but value well into the future through:\nHighly attractive earnings and growth accretion. Demonstrated track records by both companies of producing meaningful total shareholder return (share price appreciation + dividends). A strong balance sheet that enhances financial flexibility to increase growth. A solid credit profile that supports future share repurchase. Enhanced equity value from the formation of a leading pure play national water company. Continued investment in a company that cares about the environment for our communities, customers and employees.\nIn contrast, Cal Water’s inferior non-binding indication asks you to forgo these compelling opportunities. How? Under Cal Water’s non-binding indication you would receive cash for your stock. That means you would no longer be an SJW Group stockholder and would have no opportunity to share in what we believe is a very bright future for our company. By comparison, the substantial ongoing benefits that will only be available to stockholders in our stock-for-stock merger of equals with Connecticut Water far outweigh Cal Water’s non-binding indication.\nSince Cal Water’s non-binding indication is cash-for-stock, it would be a taxable transaction for SJW Group stockholders. 1 For many stockholders, once you pay taxes on the transaction, you will have less than $68.25 per share. In contrast, our merger of equals with Connecticut Water is anticipated to be not taxable.\nHere’s an example: Assuming a stockholder has held SJW Group stock for 15 years, that stockholder would have acquired the shares for around $14 each. After paying up to 20 percent capital gains tax on the difference between Cal Water’s $68.25 per share and the $14 per share cost basis, the stockholder could be left with only $57 or so in cash per share.\nOver the past 15 years, SJW Group stockholders have enjoyed a dividend that has increased every year. In fact, SJW Group has paid its stockholders a dividend for the last 74 consecutive years and has increased its annual dividend in each of the last 50 years . Given our dividend track record, we believe SJW Group stockholders are best served by the proposed merger with Connecticut Water rather than trying to find another company in which to invest the money they would have left after paying taxes on the Cal Water non-binding indication.\nClearly, we believe the merger of equals with Connecticut Water remains the best choice for SJW Group and its stockholders. This is really a choice between a concrete value-creation opportunity represented by the merger of equals with Connecticut Water versus illusory value and foregone opportunities if you believe Cal Water .\nIn the near future, we will be sending you a detailed proxy statement describing our proposed merger of equals with Connecticut Water along with a GREEN proxy card. You should read the material carefully. We urge you to vote on the GREEN card FOR all proposals related to our merger of equals with Connecticut Water. If you receive any materials from Cal Water, there is no need for action on your part. We recommend that you recycle the white cards and any materials you might receive from Cal Water.\nSincerely,\nThe SJW Group Board of Directors\nIf you have any questions please call our proxy solicitors:\nGeorgeson LLC\nWilliam Fiske / Edward Greene\n212-440-9800; 866-357-4029, SJW@Georgeson.com\nForward Looking Statements\nThis document contains within the meaning of the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
