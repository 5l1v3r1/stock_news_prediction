Last year, the company enjoyed a nearly 20 percent increase in revenue to $8.35 billion.\nThe company also said it planned to increase capital spending for research, manufacturing and assembly to around $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion for the full year, up from its previous target of $1.1 billion.\nSTMicroelectronics’ shares were up 2.7 percent in Paris by 0815 GMT.
