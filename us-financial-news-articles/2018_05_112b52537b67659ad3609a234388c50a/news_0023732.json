( bit.ly/2FXI0zb )\nIn November, the firm projected a decline of as much as 10 percent in fixed income tradersâ€™ bonuses for year-end 2017.\nMajor U.S. banks posted a strong first-quarter as heightened volatility in February and March, after a long period of relative market inactivity, helped their trading desks.\nJohnson Associates said it sees market volatility and interest rates as key incentive drivers for the year.\nThe quarterly compensation report also said bonuses for asset management is expected to rise only as much as 5 percent this year, down from nearly 10 percent the firm had projected for 2017 in November.\nThe firm had earlier said that for sectors like asset management, the momentum from 2017 may be difficult to replicate this year as fee and product pressures are expected to remain.
