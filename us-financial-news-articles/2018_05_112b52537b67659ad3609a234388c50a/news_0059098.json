Reminds me little bit of Pietrangelo in Rome, an amazing new stadium,” Thiem said.\n“It’s, I think, always full because there are always great matches there. People really want to be there, and it was a great investment from the tournament to put the court there.\n“The court was packed yesterday, and it was really packed today. I prefer to play on a full court with, I don’t know, 2,000, 2,500 people like court 18 than in front of 7,000 on Chatrier, because it feels kind of empty.\n“The atmosphere was amazing, so I prefer to play there.”\nIn-form Thiem, who lost to 19-year-old Tsitsipas in Barcelona, said it had been a relief to come through against a player who has made enormous strides this season.\n“Tsitsipas was for sure one of the toughest second-round opponents possible here, and I did it in four sets,” he said.\n“It was overall a very good match, so my shape is great and I’m ready for everything that’s coming up.”\nTsitsipas had been bidding to become the first Greek man to reach the third round of a Grand Slam since 1969.\n“He was hitting forehand winners everywhere today,” he said. “I felt we were evenly-matched yesterday but I played a silly service game and there was no way back.”\nThiem will face Italian Matteo Berrettini on Friday.\nCourt 18, with a 2,200 capacity, has proven popular with players and fans alike on its debut tournament.
