Other private-equity firms competing for Envision include a consortium of Carlyle Group and TPG Global, the sources added.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. KKR, Carlyle, and TPG declined to comment. Envision and HCA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nEnvision announced last year it was reviewing a range of strategic alternatives after reporting disappointing third-quarter earnings, which it attributed partly to the effects of hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as a slowdown in the growth of patient demand.\nLast year, Envision agreed to sell its ambulance unit, AMR, to Air Medical, a medical helicopter business owned by KKR, for $2.4 billion.\nThe year prior, it merged with AmSurg in an all-stock deal that valued the combined companies at the time at around $10 billion. HCA's and KKR's bid would reverse that combination.\nA sale of Envision would be the latest in a spate of mergers and acquisitions activity among physician networks, a business that has struggled in recent years to adapt to changes in how U.S. health insurers reimburse providers.\nFederal reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, for example, have been trying to shift to a \"value-based\" payment model, whereby providers sometimes receive fixed payments to encourage them to control costs.\nLast year, U.S. kidney care-provider DaVita agreed to sell its medical group business, Davita Medical Group, to UnitedHealth for $4.9 billion.\nEnvision's rival MEDNAX has also been exploring strategic alternatives, including a sale, Reuters has reported.\nIn 2016, buyout firm Blackstone acquired hospital staffing provider Team Health Holdings for $6.1 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:16:28.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
