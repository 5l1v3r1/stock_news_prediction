It is set to be broadcast on the parliament's website; parliamentarians had pushed for the event to be broadcast, criticizing the lack of transparency that would have accompanied a closed-door meeting.\nPoliticians in the U.S. and Europe are seeking answers from Facebook after it was revealed that the data of 87 million users may have been improperly shared with political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.\nIn Europe, lawmakers are set to address Facebook's approach to privacy and data protection and how the social network could have been used as a platform for misinformation to sway the results of elections.\nshow chapters Zuckerberg to testify to EU lawmakers Tuesday 12 Hours Ago | 03:17 \"I expect tough questions on Zuckerberg with regards to his data protection or non-protection regime on Facebook to explain how it's going to prevent in the future data from simply being misused from third parties, but also how it can make sure there's no interference in national or local decision-making, such as elections or referenda,\" Ska Keller, co-president of the Greens-European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\nZuckerberg was questioned by U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill last month. At times, the Facebook co-founder was unable to answer questions from politicians, saying instead that his team would follow-up with them afterwards.\nUdo Bullmann, chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, said that Zuckerberg's lack of answers to those questions would likely be seized upon during Tuesday's meeting in Brussels.\n\"We much too often heard 'I don't know,'\" Bullmann said. \"Meanwhile, we have six weeks after the discussions with U.S. colleagues so Mark Zuckerberg should know meanwhile what happened in his corporation.\"\nshow chapters Zuckerbergâ€™s EU meeting is only the beginning, lawmaker says 10 Hours Ago | 01:32 He added: \"Especially, we want to know why he did not warn customers, knowing about the malpractices since 2015.

That data had been obtained by Cambridge Analytica via Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University researcher, whose personality quiz app \"This Is Your Digital Life\" harvested the data of Facebook users and their friends.\nA sweeping overhaul of Europe's data protection legislation is set to come into force on Friday. The law, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) , threatens to fine firms up to 4 percent of annual global turnover or 20 million euros ($23.6 million), whichever is the highest amount.\nThe regulation aims to take control over data from businesses and place it in the hands of consumers. Once implemented, it will let people force firms to delete data on them and will make it compulsory for companies to notify authorities about data breaches within 72 hours of first becoming aware of it.\nIn an emailed statement Monday, a spokesperson for Facebook said the company was \"looking forward to the meeting and happy for it to be livestreamed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:34:36.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
