(NASDAQ:RYTM), a biopharmaceutical company aimed at developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of rare genetic disorders of obesity, today reported financial results and provided a business update for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Our achievements year-to-date reflect our dual commitment to addressing the unmet medical needs of people living with rare genetic disorders of obesity and raising awareness and understanding of these conditions,” said Keith Gottesdiener, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Rhythm. “In addition to advancing our ongoing clinical trials of setmelanotide across six melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway deficiencies, we expanded our pipeline with the in-licensing of RM-853, a preclinical ghrelin o-acyltransferase (GOAT) inhibitor for the treatment of PWS that may have benefit both as a single agent or in combination with setmelanotide. We are on track to complete enrollment in our Phase 3 trial in POMC deficiency obesity by the end of the second quarter, and are particularly encouraged by the rate of enrollment in our Phase 3 trial in leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency obesity, which we initiated earlier this year.\nDr. Gottesdiener continued, “We are also pleased that the FDA agreed that BBS and Alström Syndrome are included under our existing BTD for setmelanotide, underscoring the need for medicines that effectively address the excess hunger and weight gain associated with rare genetic disorders of obesity. We look forward to continuing our work with physicians and the broader community to improve the diagnosis of, and ultimately treat, people living with these conditions.”\nRecent Business Highlights:\nRhythm today announced that the FDA has agreed that BBS and Alström Syndrome, two rare genetic disorders of obesity for which there are currently no effective or approved therapeutics, are included under the previously granted BTD for setmelanotide. The FDA previously granted BTD to setmelanotide for the treatment of POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity. In May 2018, longer-term data from Rhythm’s Phase 2 open-label study of setmelanotide in patients with LEPR deficiency obesity were published online in Nature Medicine . All three patients treated with setmelanotide experienced reductions in excess hunger, also referred to as hyperphagia, and body-weight. The data show that setmelanotide was well-tolerated. The publication also detailed the results of in vitro analyses that provide insight into setmelanotide’s activity at the MC4R, suggesting that it may rescue specific MC4R mutations where the natural ligand cannot. In May 2018, the results of new genetic epidemiological analyses of known and predicted loss of function variants in the POMC, PCSK1 and LEPR genes were published online in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism . This publication builds on data previously presented by Rhythm in a late-breaking poster presentation at ENDO 2018 in April, suggesting that there are potentially more than 12,000 people living in the U.S. with rare genetic disorders of obesity. In April 2018, Rhythm acquired exclusive, worldwide rights from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited to develop and commercialize RM-853, a potent, orally available GOAT inhibitor currently in preclinical development for PWS. In preclinical research, RM-853 prevented body weight gain and reduced fat mass in high fat-fed mice, with a favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profile. Rhythm continues to assess opportunities to further evaluate setmelanotide in PWS and plans to pursue those in parallel with the development of RM-853. Additionally, given setmelanotide and RM-853’s distinct mechanisms of action, Rhythm will explore opportunities to evaluate the two compounds in combination, as there may be complementary effects.\nUpcoming Milestones:\nRhythm expects to complete enrollment of ten patients in its ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial of setmelanotide in patients with POMC deficiency obesity in the first half of 2018. Rhythm expects to announce initial data from the trial in the first half of 2019, and to subsequently file an NDA with the FDA based on one-year data from the cohort of ten patients. Rhythm expects to complete enrollment of ten patients in its ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial of setmelanotide in patients with LEPR deficiency obesity by the end of 2018. Rhythm expects to announce initial data from its ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept basket study of setmelanotide in each of Alström Syndrome, POMC epigenetic disorders, and POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity in the first half of 2018. Rhythm expects to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating setmelanotide for the treatment of BBS in 2018. Rhythm expects to complete preclinical studies of RM-853 and file an IND with the FDA in the first quarter of 2020.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nCash Position: As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $136.5 million, as compared to $148.1 million as of December 31, 2017. This decrease reflects cash used to fund operating activities in the first quarter of 2018. R&D Expenses: R&D expenses were $12.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to non-cash expenses related to the license acquired from Takeda for RM-853, a $1 million milestone expense associated with the license agreement with Ipsen Pharma S.A.S. and the hiring of additional personnel in the clinical and development departments in the second half of 2017. S,G&A Expenses: S,G&A expenses were $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount, the development and building of our commercial organization to drive patient identification, as well as increased professional and consulting fees associated with being a public company. Net Loss: Net loss was $16.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, or a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.60, as compared to a net loss of $7.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, or a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.74.\nFinancial Guidance\nBased on its current clinical development plans, Rhythm expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient for Rhythm to fund its operations into the second half of 2019.\nAbout Rhythm Pharmaceuticals\nRhythm is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of rare genetic disorders of obesity.
