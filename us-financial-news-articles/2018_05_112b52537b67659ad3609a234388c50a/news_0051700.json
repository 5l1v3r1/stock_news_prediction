Neither will they fear Australia in their final group game in Sochi.\n“Nothing has been nor will be easy,” said Tapia, assessing Group C.\nGareca, 60, a familiar sight with his long hair and animated gestures, wants his close-knit team to assuage Peru’s historical anguish at being away from the finals for nearly four decades.\n“I want us to boss matches, whoever and wherever we’re playing,” he said.\nReporting by Andrew Cawthorne and Diego Ore; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:59:13.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
