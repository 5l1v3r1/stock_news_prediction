During the fourth quarter of 2017, installation of the shaft exhaust fan commenced and is on target to be finished in early second quarter 2018. Shaft 5 is 6.7 metres in diameter and will be dedicated to ventilation thereby increasing the capacity for underground activities. The sinking of Shaft 2 was completed in January 2018 with fit out expected to occur over 2018. Shaft 2 will be used for access, production and ventilation. During the fourth quarter of 2017 project operator Rio Tinto undertook a schedule and cost review and reported there were no material changes in project scope, cost or schedule.

The reduction from 2016 to 2018 was due to both a reduction in exploration related expenditures and foreign exchange fluctuations primarily related to the USD:CAD exchange rate.\nExploration costs were lower in both 2018 and 2017 compared to 2016 due to a reduction in staffing and general administrative costs in Mongolia.\nGeneral and administration expenditures in 2018 were lower than the same period in 2017 due to one-time strategic reorganization costs in 2017. The expenditures in 2018 were similar to the same period in 2016.\nThe total assets as at March 31, 2018 are substantially lower than the comparative periods due to the completion of the restructuring and resulting roll out of the Company's U.S. assets and $8,843,232 in cash and cash equivalents into Mason Resources Corp. in Q2 2017.
