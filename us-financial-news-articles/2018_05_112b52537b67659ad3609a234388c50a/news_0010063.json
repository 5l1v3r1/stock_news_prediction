(NYSE: MD), the national health solutions partner specializing in neonatology, anesthesiology, radiology, maternal-fetal medicine, other pediatric services, and management services, today reported earnings of $0.68 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, MEDNAX reported Adjusted EPS of $0.89.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, MEDNAX reported the following results:\nNet revenue of $902 million; Net income of $63 million; and EBITDA of $134 million.\n“Our operating results for the first quarter were at the high end of our expectations and reflect further execution of our corporate initiatives,” said Roger J. Medel, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of MEDNAX. “We have begun 2018 with progress in all aspects of the focus areas we identified through 2017, including cost and service excellence, practice-level operating plans, and continuing our strategic growth. Notably, we have expanded the scope of our internal initiatives while also supporting the growth of our organization, which thus far this year has included additions to the radiology groups who joined MEDNAX during 2017. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on execution of our plans, which we believe will position us well to deliver a differentiated value proposition and to remain committed to taking great care of our patients.”\nOperating Results\nMEDNAX’s net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by 7.9 percent, to $901.9 million, from $835.6 million for the prior-year period. MEDNAX’s revenue growth attributable to recent acquisitions was 4.4 percent, while overall same-unit revenue increased by 3.5 percent when compared to the prior-year period.\nSame-unit revenue from net reimbursement-related factors increased by 2.1 percent for the 2018 first quarter as compared to the prior-year period. The net increase in revenue was primarily due to modest improvements in managed care contracting and an increase in the administrative fees received from MEDNAX’s hospital partners.\nThe percentage of services reimbursed under government programs was unfavorable by roughly 70 basis points for the first quarter compared with the prior-year period, reflecting modestly unfavorable comparisons for anesthesiology and neonatology and other pediatric services. This unfavorable payor mix comparison impacted same-unit revenue growth from net reimbursement-related factors negatively by roughly 80 basis points.\nSame-unit revenue attributable to patient volume increased by 1.4 percent for the 2018 first quarter as compared to the prior-year period. Volumes increased across almost all of the Company’s service lines. For the 2018 first quarter, same-unit neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patient days increased by 1.2 percent compared to the prior-year period.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, practice salaries and benefits expense was $631.8 million, compared to $572.4 million for the prior-year period. Practice salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 70.1 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 68.5 percent for the prior-year period. This increase in expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to growth in clinician compensation expense at existing practices, support for organic-growth initiatives as well as to support acquisition-related growth.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, general and administrative expenses were $108.8 million, as compared to $103.8 million for the prior-year period. Included within general and administrative expenses was an increase of approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense primarily resulting from the change in timing of the Company’s annual equity grant from June to March in order to align the timing with other compensation related activities. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 12.1 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 12.4 percent for the prior-year period.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA) for the 2018 first quarter was $133.6 million, compared to $133.0 million for the prior-year period. EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue was 14.8 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 15.9 percent in the prior-year period, with this decline primarily reflecting higher operating expense growth as compared to revenue growth.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $26.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $25.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.6 million that primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets from recent acquisitions.\nInterest expense was $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $17.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to a higher effective interest rate on borrowings between the two periods and slightly higher outstanding borrowings.\nMEDNAX generated net income of $63.4 million for the 2018 first quarter, or $0.68 per diluted share based on a weighted average 93.5 million shares outstanding. This compares with net income of $54.7 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the 2017 first quarter, based on a weighted average 93.1 million shares outstanding.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 27.5 percent, compared to 39.0 percent for the first quarter of 2017, related to the reduction in the corporate tax rate enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, MEDNAX reported Adjusted EPS of $0.89, compared to $0.75 for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted net income per common and common equivalent share excluding non-cash amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense.\nMEDNAX had cash and cash equivalents of $40.9 million at March 31, 2018, and net accounts receivable were $542.6 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, MEDNAX used $113.6 million to fund operations, which compares to $21.8 million used to fund operations during the 2017 first quarter. MEDNAX typically uses cash during the first quarter of each year as it pays incentive compensation, principally to its physicians, and employee benefit plan matching contributions that were accrued during the prior year. The use of cash during the first quarter of 2018 also reflects the payment of taxes related to 2017 that were deferred for companies impacted by the 2017 hurricanes.\nMEDNAX used $22.4 million during the 2018 first quarter to fund acquisitions and to make contingent purchase price and other payments for previously completed acquisitions. During the quarter, four physician groups were acquired across neonatology, radiology and pediatric subspecialty services.\nAt March 31, 2018, MEDNAX had total net debt outstanding of $2.0 billion, consisting primarily of its borrowings under its revolving credit facility and senior notes. At March 31, 2018, the amount of additional borrowing capacity available under the Company’s revolving credit facility was approximately $780 million.\nSince the end of the first quarter, MEDNAX has announced the acquisition of Women’s Radiology Associates LLP, a radiology practice based in Houston, Texas. This marked the fifth physician group practice group to become part of MEDNAX in 2018 and the sixth radiology services practice acquisition the Company has completed as part of its radiology growth strategy.\n2018 Second Quarter Outlook\nFor the 2018 second quarter, MEDNAX expects earnings per share will be in a range of $0.81 to $0.86 per diluted share and Adjusted EPS will be in a range of $1.04 to $1.09. The Adjusted EPS range excludes $0.14 per diluted share of estimated amortization expense and $0.09 per diluted share of estimated stock-based compensation expense.\nThis outlook assumes that total same-unit revenue growth for the three months ended June 30, 2018 will be in a range of two to four percent, compared to the prior-year period.\nAdditionally, for the 2018 second quarter, MEDNAX expects that EBITDA growth will be between one percent and six percent, compared to the prior-year period EBITDA of $148.7 million. Related to expected EBITDA growth, included within expected general and administrative expense for the second quarter of 2018 is approximately $4.0 million primarily related to the previously mentioned change in the timing of the Company’s annual equity grant from June to March in order to align the timing with other compensation related activities.\nThis outlook also assumes an effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 of 27 percent.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nA reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is provided in the financial tables of this press release.
