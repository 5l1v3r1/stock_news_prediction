We’re informed of the massive arrival of populations inside our forests each week,” Donwahi said.\nIvory Coast has carried out on again-off again campaigns to expel squatting farmers from national parks and forest reserves in recent years, often coming under criticism from rights groups decrying the authorities’ heavy-handed tactics.\nDonwahi said the government would restart evictions from the Goin-Debe forest reserve - Ivory Coast’s largest - and destroy cocoa plantations there following a one-month census.\nThe invasion of Ivory Coast’s protected forests was helped by a decade-long political crisis that included two civil wars and eroded state authority.\nDespite a restoration of order in 2011, the continued degradation of parks and forest reserves has been facilitated by rampant corruption.\n“It’s not just forestry agents directly involved,” Donwahi said. “Local governments as well as the tribal leadership and police are also responsible. These illegal squatters get escorted. That must stop.”\n($1 = 578.6400 CFA francs)\nReporting by Ange Aboa; Writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Susan Fenton, Edmund Blair and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:57:12.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
