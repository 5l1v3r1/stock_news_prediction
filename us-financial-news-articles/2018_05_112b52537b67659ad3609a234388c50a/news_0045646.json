He asked President Michel Temer to send a draft bill instead, which would likely take more time to go through both houses of Congress.\n“It becomes very hard now to head in the direction of a privatization,” former energy minister Fernando Coelho told Reuters on the sidelines of a power industry seminar in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.\nWith a general election scheduled for October, Congress likely will not have enough time to evaluate and vote on a new draft bill.\n“Congress was absolutely irresponsible,” Elena Landau, former chairwoman of Eletrobras, told reporters at the power event.\nTemer’s government announced plans to sell a controlling stake in Eletrobras last August.\nThe presidential decree would have helped clear some of the debt of several power distribution subsidiaries in the north of Brazil that Eletrobras wanted to sell.\nIt would have allowed the firm to receive around 8 billion reais ($2.2 billion) in credits due to those subsidiaries, and was also set to change some power generation policies to give more assurances to investors willing to participate in the sale of Eletrobras.\nEletrobras is the largest power generator in Brazil and controls dozens of subsidiaries in all regions. Control of it is a politically sensitive topic, as many politicians have had the power to nominate directors for some of its branches.\n$1 = 3.6457 reais Reporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier and Luciano Costa, Additional reporting and writing by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:45:09.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
