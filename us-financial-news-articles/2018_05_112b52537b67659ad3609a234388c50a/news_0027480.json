Companies Grapple With AI’s Opaque Decision-Making Process Digital Assistants Start to Get More Human Experts view AI technologies as a big potential growth area for U.S. businesses. But it has raised concerns about the potential for job losses and other harms. It also has emerged as one of the areas at the center of intensifying competition between the U.S. and China for global technological supremacy.\nAbout 40 firms are expected to be represented at the meeting, including tech giants Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. unit Google, Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Big non-tech companies participating include Bank of America Corp. , Boeing Co. , General Electric Co. , Ford Motor Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Walmart Inc.\nBut companies generally are sending AI and information-technology specialists, not their chief executives. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and CVS Health Corp. CEO Larry Merlo are among the small group of chief executives attending.\nOrganizers say they don’t believe that President Donald Trump will attend.\nRelated Video Top AI thinkers including Future Today Institute founder Amy Webb, Primer CEO and founder Sean Gourley, and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, share their thoughts on the future of machine and human interaction, at WSJ's Future of Everything Festival. The meeting—to be held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building—is being cast as a dialogue that will help the administration shape future policies, including removing barriers to AI innovation.\nThe administration is hoping to strike a balance with the event, welcoming the benefits of artificial intelligence while also acknowledging potential political challenges.\nAlready, legislation to speed development of autonomous vehicles has run into opposition in Congress this year, in part over safety concerns. That could encourage a thicket of new rules at the state level, delaying deployment of the technology, advocates for the emerging industry say.\nThe legislation also has stirred political squabbles over the prospect of autonomous trucks, which are viewed with apprehension by drivers and their unions.\nAI leaders want government and businesses to work together to help AI grow, while avoiding unwanted harms.\n“The tech sector is committed to ensuring that all Americans reap the benefits of this transformative technology, which has the potential to save lives, improve how we harvest food, transform education and more,” said Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group, in a statement.\nBut the event schedule suggests that the focus will be largely on benefits of AI, rather than potential harms or how to mitigate them. Discussion topics will include supporting AI research and development; developing the American workforce to take advantage of AI; removing barriers to AI innovation; and enabling high-impact, sector-specific applications of AI.\nThe event also will focus on applications of AI in specific sectors, including food and agriculture, energy and manufacturing, financial services, health care and transportation and logistics.\nMelika Carroll, a government affairs official at the Internet Association, said: “AI has great potential to transform and improve our daily lives. ... We applaud the Trump administration for furthering this important conversation and ensuring the U.S. is prepared to take advantage of all AI has to offer across every sector of society and the economy.”\nThe draft schedule says: “As the world leader in the development of AI, the United States plays a unique role in driving the adoption of AI by industry and the broader public.” The summit will convene industry and government officials to discuss policies “to fully realize the promise of AI for the American people.”\nWrite to John D.
