REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\nWhiteley was named South Africa captain last year but was injured in the build-up to the final test of the three-match series against France last June.\nHe missed the entire Rugby Championship campaign against Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, plus away tests against Ireland, France, Italy and Wales in November and December.\nEben Etzebeth took over as Springbok skipper but he, too, has not played this year, having undergone surgery on his shoulder.\nThough speculation around the captaincy continues, there have been local media reports saying that Etzebeth could be named in the squad after stepping up his training regime in recent weeks.
