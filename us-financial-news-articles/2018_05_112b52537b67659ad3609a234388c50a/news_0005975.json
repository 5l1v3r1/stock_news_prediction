REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo SocGen reported a higher-than-expected quarterly net income, amid a top management reshuffle happening in the middle of discussions with the U.S. authorities over litigation issues, but its group revenues missed forecasts.\nSocGen’s corporate and investment bank (CIB) was a particularly weak spot.\n“Disappointing performance in Q1. Stock under pressure due to a lower performance in CIB, the unexpected change of management is not helpful at this stage and no finalization of the litigation,” Jefferies’ analysts wrote on SocGen’s results.\nBNP Paribas showed a similar picture to SocGen, with BNP Paribas also impacted by sluggish fixed income trading.\n“A difficult CIB quarter but not a bad performance,” wrote UBS analysts on the BNP Paribas results.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T10:45:47.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
