Livestock was up 2.1 percent and poultry climbed 5.2 percent, but fisheries output contracted 4.6 percent.\nAgricultural output has accounted for about a tenth of gross domestic product in recent quarters.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz Editing by Joseph Radford\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:30:14.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
