It's \"crazy\" to only look at the headline numbers and view them as the be-all, end-all for the housing market, he said.\n\"How could any journalists reach this conclusion without even listening to the conference call? It's media malpractice,\" Cramer said.\n\"Now, obviously, the market was terrible today so Home Depot's stock still ended up getting slammed,\" he continued. \"Still, when you actually listen to the conference call, which I tell you you must, it's clear that the only readthroughs from this quarter are positive, not negative. And, for the record, when a company as outstanding as Home Depot blames its problems on the weather, it may make sense, for once, to give them the darn benefit of the doubt.\"\nWATCH: Cramer defends Home Depot's quarter show chapters Cramer calls on investors to listen to Home Depot's conference call after earnings miss 22 Hours Ago | 04:36 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
