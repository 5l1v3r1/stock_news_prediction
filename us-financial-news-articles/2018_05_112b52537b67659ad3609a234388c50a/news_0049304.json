A capital market forerunner in the cannabis sector, he was one of the first to cover Canada’s growing list of publicly traded cannabis companies and is an expert on the U.S. sector.\nCannabis is the fastest growing industry in North America. It had sales of $9.2 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to $47.3 billion by 2027, according to BDS Analytics . As the industry matures, cannabis companies have increasingly sought to raise capital via the public markets. The more established companies have listed on bona fide exchanges in Canada and the U.S. like the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Canadian Securities Exchange. Ajamian will be MedMen’s principal liaison with brokers and financial analysts covering investment opportunities in the cannabis space.\n“The cannabis industry needs professional expertise at all levels and MedMen has been assembling the best talent in every field,” said MedMen CEO Adam Bierman. “Vahan is a respected voice of authority in the cannabis sector, and we are proud to have him represent MedMen.”\nPrior to joining MedMen, Ajamian was an equity research analyst at Beacon Securities, a full-service independent investment firm with offices across Canada. He was the first analyst to report on the broader U.S. cannabis sector and was frequently cited by both investors and news media publications. Prior to Beacon Securities, Ajamian was an equity research associate at TD Securities.\n“Cannabis is an exciting, fast moving space and MedMen is leading the charge,” Ajamian said. “I am proud to be joining a company that is defining the industry.”\nABOUT MEDMEN:\nMedMen Enterprises is the preeminent cannabis company in the U.S. and the most recognized brand in the emerging marijuana industry, with assets and operations in key markets.
