REUTERS/Pichi Chuang/File Photo\nThe U.S. government last month banned American firms from selling to ZTE for seven years, saying the company had failed to comply with a settlement related to ZTE shipping U.S.-made goods to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.\nFollowing the U.S. ban, Taiwan had instructed local firms wanting to ship goods to ZTE to apply for permission.\nMediatek confirmed to Reuters on Monday that it had received the export permit last week to ship products to ZTE.\nAn official with Taiwan’s Bureau of Foreign Trade said the government had approved a permit for Mediatek, and that it had received applications from “several” other tech firms.\n“We fully understand high-tech factories’ characteristic of fast-paced shipments of goods, we won’t create obstacles for the pace of their exports,” the foreign trade official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.
