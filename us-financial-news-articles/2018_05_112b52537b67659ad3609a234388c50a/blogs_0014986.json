When the result was shown, there were chants of “Nikol!”, white doves were released into the air and people hugged and kissed each other.\nRelated Coverage Armenia's interim PM Karapetyan says stepping down Putin congratulates Armenian protest leader Pashinyan on becoming PM: Kremlin Factbox: Armenian protest leader sweeps to power “We won! We made history today!” said Gurgen Simonyan, 22, a student in the crowd.\nPashinyan’s protest movement was sparked when Sarksyan, barred by the constitution from seeking another term as president, became prime minister instead. Many Armenians saw that as a cynical ploy by Sarskyan to extend his hold on power.\nNEW SCRIPT Armenia is a country of about three million people nestled in mountains between Iran, Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan.\nSince it emerged as an independent state after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia, a majority Christian country, has been locked in a territorial conflict with mainly-Muslim Azerbaijan, and under economic blockade from Turkey.\nIts isolation led it to depend heavily on former colonial ruler Moscow. Putin has in the past resisted popular revolts in ex-Soviet states, particular in Georgia and Ukraine, viewing them as a ploy by Washington to encroach on Moscow’s sphere of influence.\nBut throughout Armenia’s wave of protests, Moscow has remained publicly neutral, and Pashinyan has consistently said he viewed Moscow as a vital ally.\nHe said on Tuesday Armenia would stay in a regional collective security organization headed by Russia and that he hoped for a meeting with Putin.\nNewly elected Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan (L) greets supporters during a meeting in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Hayk Baghdasaryan/Photolure The Kremlin said Putin sent Pashinyan a congratulatory telegram. “I hope your activities as head of the government will help further strengthen the ties of friendship and alliance between our countries,” Putin said in the message.\nThomas de Waal, a specialist on the region with Carnegie Europe, a think tank, said with the Armenian uprising, both Yerevan and Moscow had learned a new script.\n“Russian officials have insisted that they respect Armenians’ right to peaceful change,” he said. “For his part, Pashinyan and his fellow protest leaders told their supporters to avoid anti-Russian or pro-EU slogans.”\nHOLDOVERS Pashinyan faces tough challenges. The civil service and security apparatus are dominated by allies of his ousted predecessor.\nHe has said his first step will be to hold an early parliamentary election. In the meantime, he said he would carry out root-and-branch reforms to cut out graft and cronyism.\nHe said he would fire some holdovers from the ruling elite, among them the defense minister, but said there would be no “pogrom.”\nHe must also reckon with a parliament where the Republican Party, allied to Sarskyan, holds a majority of seats and is skeptical about his revolution.\nVahram Baghdasaryan, head of the Republican Party in parliament, said for the sake of unity it was backing Pashinyan for prime minister but it had concerns about his fitness to run the country.\n“I hope we are mistaken,” said Baghdasaryan, an ally of Sarskyan.\nSlideshow (2 Images) In his speech before the vote, Pashinyan called on Armenia’s people to come together behind the new government he will lead. “The page of hatred should be turned,” he said, adding: “May God help us.”\nWriting by Christian Lowe; Editing by Janet Lawrence\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
