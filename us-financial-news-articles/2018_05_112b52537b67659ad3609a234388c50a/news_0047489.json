Net loss during the 2018 Predecessor Period was $14.9 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration costs and other items (\"Adjusted EBITDAX\") was $35.5 million for the Successor Period and $14.2 million for the Predecessor Period. Adjusted EBITDAX is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is described in the attached table under “Non-GAAP Financial Information and Reconciliation.”\nTotal production for the first quarter of 2018 was 2,163 MBOE, or an average of 24.0 MBOE per day, up 24%, compared to 1,737 MBOE or 19.3 MBOE per day in the 2017 Predecessor Period. The increase in production is primarily a result of the continued successful development of AMHLP’s STACK play.\nTotal Exploration and Production Segment costs for the Successor Period, which includes lease operating expense, marketing and transportation costs, production and ad valorem taxes and workover expenses, were $16.6 million, or $13.26 per BOE.\nGeneral and administrative costs for the Successor Period were $34.6 million including non-recurring equity based compensation expense of $3.5 million and business combination organization expense of $25.3 million. When adjusted for these non-recurring, non-cash items, general and administrative costs for the Successor Period would have been $5.8 million.\nBorrowing Base Increased\nAMHLP’s recently completed its regularly scheduled semi-annual redetermination process and its borrowing base under the senior secured revolving credit facility increased from $350 million to $400 million. This increase reflects the reserve growth from the AMHLP’s existing STACK assets. AMHLP is in compliance with all of the financial covenants associated with the credit facility and the next scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base is October 1, 2018.\nAbout Alta Mesa Resources, Inc\nAlta Mesa Resources, Inc., is an independent energy company focused on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, and through Kingfisher Midstream, LLC, provides best-in-class midstream energy services, including crude oil and gas gathering, processing and marketing to producers in the STACK play.\nFOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT : Lance L.

Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income (loss) before interest expense, exploration expense, depletion, depreciation and amortization, impairment of oil and natural gas properties, accretion of asset retirement obligations, tax expense, gain (loss) on sale of assets and the non-cash portion of gain/loss on oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids derivative contracts. Alta Mesa’s management believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to more effectively evaluate our operating performance, compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure and because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measurement of Alta Mesa’s financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of Alta Mesa’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDAX has significant limitations, including that it does not reflect Alta Mesa’s cash requirements for capital expenditures, contractual commitments, working capital or debt service. In addition, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDAX differently than Alta Mesa does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDAX for the periods indicated (unaudited in thousands).\nEBITDAX Calculation (Non-GAAP Measure) Feb 9 –\nMar 31,\n2018\nSuccessor Jan 1 –\nFeb 8,\n2018\nPredecessor Net Loss attributable to Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. $ (13,235 ) $ (14,892 ) Net Loss attributable to Noncontrolling Interest (20,314 ) - Taxes (3,813 ) - Interest 5,444 5,511 (Gain) loss on derivative contracts 22,646\n(7,298 ) Settlements of derivative contracts (4,610 ) (1,661 ) Exploration 4,955 3,633 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 15,577 11,784 Accretion expense 102 39 Stock Compensation expense 3,466 - EBITDAX 10,218 (2,884 ) Non-recurring Business Combination Expense 25,291 17,040 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 35,509 $ 14,156 *Successor Company and Period:\nThe financial statements and certain footnote presentations separate the Company’s presentations into two distinct periods, the period before the consummation of the Business Combination, which is from January 1, 2018 to February 8, 2018 (“2018 Predecessor Period”) and the period after the consummation of the Business Combination, which is from February 9, 2018 to March 31, 2018 (“Successor Period”), to indicate the application of the different basis of accounting between the periods presented. The three months ended March 31, 2017 is referred to as the “2017 Predecessor Period”. AMHLP is the “Predecessor” for periods prior to the Business Combination, which do not include the consolidation of the Company and Kingfisher. For the periods after the Business Combination, Alta Mesa Resources, including the consolidation of AMHLP and Kingfisher, is the “Successor”.\nSource:Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5CJai35EpmfgnEQD2MIHA-UUqZb63W7hqdEJyy0DZ1qFoRcSMZf1QvHEXjmCyaFA_f5fnPw1ZL-6Zws68X63qaq_fTNMdRyR9SDc4hu0SXk=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/16a40d47-8bd0-4ae1-b524-e1ea3b56ecab"], "published": "2018-05-22T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T02:54:58.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
