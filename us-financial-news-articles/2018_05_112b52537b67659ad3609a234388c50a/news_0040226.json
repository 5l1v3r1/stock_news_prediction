The rise in U.S. oil production has encouraged some policymakers to speak about achieving energy independence or even a second era of energy dominance.\nThe reality is more complicated. Increased domestic energy production is clearly beneficial for the economy.\nBut sharp increases or reductions in oil prices can still have profound distributional effects within the United States.\nSince capital and labour do not move without friction between industries and states, sudden income redistribution can still have an adverse impact on the overall performance of the economy.\nThe oil slump between 2014 and 2016 deepened the overall slowdown in business investment and contributed to a soft patch in overall economic growth, which initially overshadowed the gains for consumers.\nThe rise in prices since 2016 is now contributing to an acceleration of business investment and activity in the oil and gas sector and all along the supply chain, helping boost the overall economic expansion.\nMining, which includes oil and gas production, was the fastest-growing sector of the U.S. economy in 2017 (“Gross domestic product by industry: fourth quarter and annual 2017”, Bureau of Economic Analysis, April 2018).\nRising oil prices are one reason the economies of some major oil-producing states outperformed the rest of the country towards the end of 2017.\nTexas was the fastest-growing state economy in the country in the final three months of 2017 (“Gross domestic product by state: fourth quarter and annual 2017”, Bureau of Economic Analysis, May 2018).\nBut beyond a certain point, rising oil prices will start to weigh on investment and spending by the non-oil sector and households, retarding overall growth.\nMoreover, the United States remains embedded in a dense web of international trading relationships with petroleum producing and consuming countries.\nHigher oil prices tend to improve the opportunities for U.S. exports and outward investment in petroleum-exporting countries in the Middle East and other regions.\nBut they also tend to curb export growth to petroleum-importing countries, notably China, India, Japan and in Europe, which include some of the country’s most important trading partners.\nRelated columns:\n- Trouble looms for developing countries as commodity revenues collapse, Reuters, Sept. 30, 2016\n- U.S. economy slows sharply as oil and gas slump deepens, Reuters, Feb. 1, 2016\n- Oil shock is hurting U.S. economy, Reuters, Jan. 19, 2016\n- Commodity slump intensifies risks to emerging markets, Reuters, Oct. 8, 2015\n- Falling oil investment will hit U.S. economy, Reuters, Jan. 21, 2015 (Editing by Dale Hudson)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
