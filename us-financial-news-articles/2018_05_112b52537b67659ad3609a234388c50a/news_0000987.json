The revenue increase was driven by strong growth in the consumer money transfer business.\n“We were able to sustain the growth momentum generated at the end of 2017,” said president and chief executive officer Hikmet Ersek. “Our digital money transfer business posted another impressive quarter, with westernunion.com delivering a 23% revenue increase.”\nErsek added, “The positive traction in our core business helps enable us to pursue new customer segments in cross-border money movement.”\nGAAP earnings per share in the quarter was $0.46 compared to $0.33 in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.45 compared to $0.35 in the prior year period. The increase in earnings per share was primarily due to revenue growth, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal stated, “We delivered strong revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow in the first quarter and are solidly on track to meet our full year targets.”\nQ1 Business Unit Highlights\nConsumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues, which represented 79% of total Company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%, or 5% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%. Geographically, revenue growth was led by sends originated in Latin America, North America, and Europe.\nWesternunion.com C2C revenues increased 23%, or 20% constant currency, on transaction growth of 24% and represented 11% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Western Union Business Solutions revenues increased 3% or decreased 2% on a constant currency basis. Business Solutions represented 7% of total Company revenues in the quarter. Other revenues, which primarily consist of bill payments businesses in the U.S. and Argentina, increased 4%, or 10% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by the Pago Facil Argentina walk-in and the Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payments businesses. Other revenues represented 14% of total Company revenues in the quarter.\nAdditional Q1 Financial Highlights\nGAAP operating margin in the quarter was 19.1%, which compares to 18.4% in the prior year period, or 19.5% in the prior year on an adjusted basis. The adjusted margin decrease was primarily due to higher marketing spending and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by operating leverage from revenue growth. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 8.9% compared to 24.1% in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, the tax rate was 11.4% compared to 24.8% in the prior year period. The prior year tax rate reflected a negative impact from changes in the internal ownership structure of certain of the Company’s international subsidiaries, while the current year rate benefited from certain discrete items. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $133 million, which included the impact of a $60 million payment for the previously announced NYDFS settlement and approximately $20 million of outflows for prior year WU Way expenses. The Company returned $88 million in dividends to shareholders in the first quarter.\nAdjustment Items\nAdjusted metrics for the 2018 first quarter exclude the impact of a $6 million tax benefit related to changes in estimates for the provisional accounting for United States tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”).\nAdjusted metrics for the 2017 first quarter exclude $14 million of WU Way related expenses and the associated tax benefits.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company affirmed its revenue, operating margin, and cash flow outlooks for 2018, which were previously reported on February 13. The GAAP earnings per share outlook was increased to reflect a more favorable expected tax rate and the impact of the adjustment related to the 2017 Tax Act. An adjusted EPS outlook that excludes the Tax Act benefit has also now been provided.\nRevenue\nLow to mid-single digit increase in GAAP and constant currency revenue\nOperating Profit Margin\nOperating margin of approximately 20%\nTax Rate\nGAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14% and adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% (previously 15% to 16%)\nEarnings per Share\nGAAP EPS in a range of $1.81 to $1.91 and adjusted EPS in a range of $1.80 to $1.90 (previously $1.78 to $1.90)\nCash Flow\nCash flow from operating activities of approximately $800 million, which includes approximately $200 million of outflows for the combination of anticipated final tax payments related to the agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service announced in 2011, the NYDFS settlement payment, and WU Way payments related to 2017 expenses\nAdditional Statistics\nAdditional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release.\nBeginning April 1, 2017, the Company implemented a new segment structure due to leadership and organizational structure changes. The new structure shifted all businesses previously in the historical Consumer-to-Business segment into Other.\nExpenses related to the WU Way business transformation are not included in operating segment results, as they are excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. Expenses associated with the WU Way business transformation initiative were effectively complete as of December 31, 2017.\nAll amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWestern Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures include consolidated revenue change constant currency adjusted; Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted; Consumer-to-Consumer segment westernunion.com revenue change constant currency adjusted; Business Solutions segment revenue change constant currency adjusted; Other revenue change constant currency adjusted; consolidated operating income, excluding the impact from WU Way business transformation expenses; consolidated operating margin, excluding WU Way business transformation expenses; effective tax rate excluding WU Way business transformation expenses and Tax Act; earnings per share, excluding WU Way business transformation expenses and Tax Act; effective tax rate outlook, excluding Tax Act; earnings per share outlook, excluding Tax Act; and additional measures found in the supplemental tables included with this press release. Although the expenses related to the WU Way business transformation are specific to that initiative, the types of expenses related to the WU Way business transformation are similar to expenses that the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website at http://ir.westernunion.com .\nInvestor and Analyst Conference Call and Slide Presentation\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast, including slides, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today.
