On May 7, 2018, the closing price of Clarus’ common stock was $7.10 per share. The Tender Offer is expected to commence tomorrow, May 8, 2018, and to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City Time, on June 5, 2018, unless the offer is extended.\nA modified Dutch auction tender offer allows stockholders to indicate how many Shares and at what price within the range described above they wish to tender their Shares. Based on the number of Shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, Clarus will determine the lowest price per share that will enable it to purchase $7,200,000 of Shares at such price, or a lower amount depending on the number of Shares that are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration date. All Shares purchased in the Tender Offer will be purchased at the same price, even if the stockholder tendered at a lower price. If the Tender Offer is fully subscribed, Clarus will have purchased approximately 3.3 percent to 3.6 percent of outstanding Shares as of May 7, 2018.\nIf the number of Shares properly tendered at or below the Purchase Price and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration date would result in an aggregate purchase price of more than $7,200,000, Clarus will purchase Shares tendered at or below that price on a pro rata basis. The Tender Offer will not be conditioned upon any minimum value of Shares being tendered or any financing conditions. Clarus intends to fund the purchase of the Shares using available cash, or funds borrowed under Clarus’ existing credit facility.\nWhile Clarus’ Board of Directors has authorized Clarus to make the Tender Offer, neither Clarus nor its Board of Directors makes any recommendation to any stockholder as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering any Shares or as to the price or prices at which stockholders may choose to tender their Shares. Clarus has not authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Stockholders must decide whether to tender their Shares and, if so, how many Shares to tender and at what price or prices to tender. In doing so, stockholders should carefully evaluate all of the information in the Tender Offer documents, when available, before making any decision with respect to the Tender Offer, and should consult their own broker or other financial and tax advisors.\n“We believe this Tender Offer provides an efficient means for shareholders wishing to monetize their stock at a potential premium to our current share price,” said Warren Kanders, Clarus’ executive chairman. “The Tender Offer also reflects our continued commitment to enhancing value for all of our shareholders, as well as our confidence in the future of Clarus.”\nD.F. King & Co., Inc. will serve as information agent for the Tender Offer. Stockholders with questions, or who would like to receive additional copies of the Tender Offer documents may call D.F.
