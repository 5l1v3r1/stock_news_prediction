We’ve done a great job, my team is there motivated as ever. We are producing the results for our clients and most importantly our clients are happy.”\nThe United Democratic Movement’s (UDM) allegations come three months after Cyril Ramaphosa took over as president of South Africa on promises that included rooting out corruption in government and state firms.\nThe UDM alleges that Matjila used funds to bankroll a business of someone close to him and was not prudent in paying a 4.3 billion rand for a 29 percent stake in loss-making technology upstart, Ayo Technology ( AYOJ.J ).\nResponding to criticism over the investment in Ayo Technology, Matjila said the investment was prudent: “It was a great investment. All investments you have to wait to see the results.”\nCLEARED OF WRONGDOING Last year, he was cleared of any wrongdoing by an internal audit committee that looked into allegations that he bankrolled the business of someone close him.\nUDM leader Bantu Holomisa said: “We’re challenging Ramaphosa to walk the talk.” He said his organization was preparing to send a letter to Ramaphosa to investigate the allegations.\nIn the letter, dated May 31 and seen by Reuters, UDM said Matjila should be investigated by an independent party for making questionable investments in companies such as Ayo Technology and crisis-hit retailer Steinhoff ( SNHJ.J ) ( SNHG.DE ).\nIn an interview with weekly magazine the Financial Mail, published on Thursday, Matjila defended the fund’s investment in Ayo Technology, saying it was a decision based on the prospects of the company.\n“We backed a strong BEE company,” Matjila told the Financial Mail, referring to companies majority-owned by black people. “We thought that price on the table was reasonable,” he said.\nAyo Technology, which debuted on the Johannesburg bourse in December last year, is trading at 35 rand per share, giving it a market capitalization of around 12 billion rand. That suggests the PIC stake is now worth roughly 3.5 billion rand.\nThe PIC is the biggest investor in South Africa’s economy, holding a large chunk of government bonds and stakes in blue-chip companies such as miner Anglo American ( AMSJ.J ), lender Barclays Africa ( BGAJ.J ) and grocer retailer Shoprite ( SHPJ.J ).\nEditing by James Macharia and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-31T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T10:49:36.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
