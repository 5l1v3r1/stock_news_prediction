The projects, which could be worth up to 20 billion euros overall, could start in 2019, Stefan said.\nPublic-private partnerships would also help speed up the works, with motorways seen finalised within five years, he said.\nEarlier on Tuesday, centrist President Klaus Iohannis expressed concern at the slow pace at which the government was tapping EU development funds. Of the 31.3 billion euros Brussels has allotted for Romania during 2014-2020, Bucharest has tapped only 4.9 billion euros, he said.\nReporting by Luiza Ilie\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:07:59.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
