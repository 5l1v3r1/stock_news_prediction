(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CVGI) today reported financial results .\nFirst Quarter\n($ in millions except EPS)\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\n$215.7\n$173.4\nOperating Income\n$15.5\n$4.6\nNet Income\n$9.9\n$0.6\nBasic EPS\n$0.33\n$0.02\nDiluted EPS\n$0.32\n$0.02\nPatrick Miller, President and CEO, stated, \"We are pleased with our strong year over year revenue growth that continues to trend favorably. Heavy- and medium-duty truck production in North America is forecast to be at the highest levels since 2006 and we are well positioned for strong top line performance throughout the year. Importantly, we are delivering improved earnings on the higher sales.\"\nTim Trenary, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"Revenues 2018 were $216 million, 24 percent higher than the prior year period, and operating income rose to $15.5 million, a margin of 7.2% for the quarter. On a sequential basis, the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues were up 15 percent and pull through of operating income on this improvement in revenues was 25 percent. These improved results include the benefit of the higher sales and the actions taken to address the labor shortage in our North American wire harness business, and the absence of the facility restructuring and litigation settlement costs incurred in 2017. Additionally, these improvements were achieved notwithstanding continuing pressure from rising commodity prices, tightening labor markets and costs associated with the accelerating build rates.\"\nConsolidated Results\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were $215.7 million compared to $173.4 million in the prior year period, an increase of 24.4 percent. The increase in revenues period-over-period reflects higher heavy-duty truck production in North America and improvement in the global construction markets we serve. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted first quarter 2018 revenues by $7.1 million, or by 4.1 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating income 2018 was $15.5 million compared to operating income of $4.6 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income period-over-period is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume and actions taken to address the labor shortage in our North American wire harness business. These gains were partially offset by costs associated with rising commodity prices and tighter labor markets, and costs associated with accelerating build rates. The first quarter 2017 results included $1.1 million in charges relating to facility restructuring and other related costs, and $2.4 million associated with litigation settlement costs. Net income was $9.9 million 2018, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.6 million in the prior year period, or $0.02 per diluted share.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had liquidity of $94 million: $38 million of cash and $56 million of availability from our asset based revolver. Borrowings under our asset based revolver, at March 31, 2018, were $7.5 million.\nSegment Results\nGlobal Truck and Bus Segment\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues for the Global Truck and Bus Segment in the first quarter 2018 were $128.3 million compared to $102.1 million for the prior year period, an increase of 25.7 percent primarily resulting from higher North American heavy-duty truck production. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted first quarter 2018 revenue by $0.8 million, or by 0.7 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating income 2018 was $13.2 million compared to operating income of $8.3 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income period-over-period is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume and the absence of the 2017 costs associated with the now completed facility restructuring. The first quarter of 2017 results included charges of $1.0 million relating to facility restructuring and other related costs.\nGlobal Construction and Agriculture Segment\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues for the Global Construction and Agriculture Segment in the first quarter 2018 were $91.2 million compared to $73.5 million in the prior year period, an increase of 24.1 percent primarily as a result of improvement in the global construction markets we serve. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted first quarter 2018 revenues by $6.7 million, or by 9.1 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating income 2018 was $8.2 million compared to operating income of $3.3 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income period-over-period is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume and actions taken to address the labor shortage in our North American wire harness business.\n2018 End Market Outlook\nManagement estimates that the 2018 North American Class 8 truck production will be in the range of 300,000 to 325,000 units, as compared to 256,000 units in 2017; North American Class 5-7 production is expected to be up slightly year-over-year. We believe the construction markets we serve in Europe, Asia, and North America have improved.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nA conference call to discuss this press release is scheduled for Friday, May 4, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET.
