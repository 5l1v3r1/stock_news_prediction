Banks are rising along with bond yields after outsize losses a day ago and energy companies are breaking out of a five-day losing streak as oil prices rise. Smaller companies are surging after they suffered only modest losses the day before.\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index gained 32 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,722 as of 12:15 p.m. Eastern time. It lost 1.2 percent Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 272 points, or 1.1 percent, to 24,633. The Nasdaq composite added 70 points, or 1 percent, to 7,467. The Russell 2000 index leaped 24 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,648, which put the index on pace for another record close.\nThe Russell fell less than the rest of the market on Tuesday and has fared better than other indexes in recent weeks. It closed at an all-time high on May 21.\nITALY IN FOCUS: Stocks in the U.S. and Europe sank Tuesday as investors worried that Italy would have new elections in a few months and that the vote would become a referendum on whether Italy, the third-largest economy in Europe, would stay in the euro. On Wednesday, premier-designate Carlo Cottarelli said there were \"new possibilities\" to form a government.\nItaly's FTSE MIB stock index climbed 2.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop a day earlier. Prices for Italian government bonds also rose, sending yields down following a huge surge the day before.\nThe euro rose to $1.1660 from $1.1531 a day earlier, which was its lowest level in almost a year. The dollar rose to 108.98 yen from 108.24 yen.\nGermany's DAX climbed 0.9 percent while the FTSE 100 index in Britain rose 0.7 percent. The CAC 40 in France lost 0.2 percent.\nBONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.85 percent from 2.79 percent. Interest rates rose and bank stocks recovered about half of their losses from Tuesday. When rates rise, banks can make more money on mortgages and other types of loans.\nTRADE WOES: A day after the U.S. renewed a threat to raise duties on a $50 billion list of Chinese goods, China's government accused the Trump administration of hurting its credibility by acting erratically and vowed to react if new tariffs are implemented. China said the new threat conflicts with an agreement in mid-May aimed at settling the dispute. It had threatened to respond by raising tariffs on beef, soybeans, and other imports from the U.S.\nInvestors have moved money into smaller and more U.S.-focused companies in response to the ongoing trade tensions, while multinational companies have had a rougher ride. Unlike the Russell, S&P 500 and Nasdaq, the Dow average has yet to recover from Tuesday's losses.\nENERGY: Energy companies rose as U.S. crude oil climbed 2.4 percent to $68.36 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 2.5 percent to $77.33 a barrel in London.\nExxon Mobil jumped 3.5 percent to $81.18 and Chevron rallied 2.9 percent to $124.88.\nOil prices fell 7.6 percent in the last week following reports OPEC countries and Russia might start producing more oil soon. Those countries cut production at the start of 2017, which helped take U.S. crude from about $50 a barrel in late 2016 to more than $70 this month. They had agreed to keep production at its current levels until the end of this year, but upheaval in Venezuela and new sanctions on Iran could change their plans.\nEARNINGS: Wall Street continued to pore over quarterly results from retailers. Dick's Sporting Goods soared 25.2 percent to $38.15 after it raised its annual profit forecast. Its first-quarter report was better than expected thanks in part to strong online sales. Watchmaker Movado Group rallied 15.8 percent to $48.85.\nElsewhere, printer and PC maker HP also raised its profit projections after its earnings and sales surpassed analyst estimates. HP climbed 4 percent to $22.15.\nClothing company Chico's FAS plunged 20.5 percent to $7.95 after its profit fell short of expectations and luxury retailer Michael Kors dropped 13.2 percent to $59.24 following a disappointing forecast for the year. Shoe retailer DSW gave up some of its gains from earlier in the year as it lost 7.1 percent to $24.22.\nSURVEY SAYS: Payroll processor ADP said private U.S. businesses added 178,000 jobs in May. That's a solid number even though it's not as many jobs as they added over the winter. ADP reported strong hiring in the construction, education and health care fields as well as professional and business services. The federal government will release a jobs report Friday that also includes hiring by government agencies.\nASIA: Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index dropped 1.5 percent and the Kospi of South Korea dropped 2. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 1.4 percent.\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP .
