The oil refiner expects the transaction to be completed by this year-end.\nPKN had increased its stake in Unipetrol earlier this year via a voluntary tender, offering 380 crowns per each share in the Czech downstream oil group, which valued the transaction at around 3.5 billion zlotys ($960.35 million).\nReporting by Agnieszka Barteczko, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:09:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
