Still, he said its something the company has to seriously consider if they determine it will create shareholder value over the long term.\nEarlier this month, the company confirmed it was considering a bid for rare disease drug maker Shire Plc after Reuters reported on its interest. However, the company put out a second statement hours later stating it did not intend to make an offer.
