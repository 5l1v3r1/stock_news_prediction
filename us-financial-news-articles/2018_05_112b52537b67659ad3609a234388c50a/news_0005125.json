Initial results showed a big swing to the opposition Labour Party there.\nThe night’s most closely watched results in London’s 32 boroughs had yet to be fully declared, but some initial counts showed the forecast swing to Labour in the capital was materialising, albeit not as strongly as some had expected.\nThe overall tally due later on Friday will offer the first snapshot of public opinion since an election last year in which the Conservatives suffered unexpected losses, leaving May weakened and her party arguing openly about Brexit.\nSome of the key results to watch are listed here: (Reporting by William James Editing by Darren Schuettler)\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:22:19.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
