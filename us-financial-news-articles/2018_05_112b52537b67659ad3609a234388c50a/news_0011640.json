According to media reports, the bank was first alerted to the allegations by a whistleblower in December 2013.\nDanske Bank said it expected its own investigation, which is being conducted by Danish law firm Bruun & Hjejle and overseen by the bank’s board, to be completed in September at the latest.\nAt 0810 GMT, Danske Bank shares were down 0.3 percent at 217.4 crowns. $1 = 6.2101 Danish crowns Reporting by Stine Jacobsen, additional reporting by Emil Gjerding Nielson; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T11:57:07.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
