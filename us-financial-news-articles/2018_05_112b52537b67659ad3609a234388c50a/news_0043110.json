The other one was Foxconn’s $866 million offer for PC accessories company Belkin in March.\nAcquiring Pulse, a maker of electronic components for cars and heavy industries, will strengthen Yageo’s position in the automotive electronics market, a Yageo executive told a news conference on Tuesday, underscoring the growing focus on new energy vehicles that use more smart technology.\nPulse, which also sells into the wireless and wireline communications market and defense industry, won several key customers last year, including a new contract to supply to a leading U.S. electric vehicle company, it said in January.\nLast year, Pulse reported revenue of $315 million and a net profit of $34.6 million.\nYageo provides resistors, capacitors, wireless components, and soft ferrite products for consumer, automotive and industrial markets, according to the company’s website.\nThe company’s shares have had a big run recently after years of middling performance - climbing seven fold in the past year.\nIts revenue rose 62 percent in the March quarter to a record $11 billion Taiwan dollar ($368.25 million) while the company posted its highest ever net profit as well.\nReporting by Jess Macy Yu, Chyen Yee Lee and Taiwan bureau; Additional reporting by Kane Wu from Hong Kong; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T10:39:03.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
