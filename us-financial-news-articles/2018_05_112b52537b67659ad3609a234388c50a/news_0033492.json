That triggered regulatory warnings and threats to crack down on the market.\nChina, a major market, has shut down local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.\nOfficials from Golix and Styx24.com, Zimbabwe’s other trading platform could not immediately comment on the central bank decision.\nAn industry insider who follows the cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe said the RBZ ban would affect settlements between exchanges but sales between individuals would not be impacted.\n“We can sit over a cup of coffee and transfer cryptos among ourselves. The entire logic of crypto is peer to peer transaction without trusted third parties,” said the insider, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press.
