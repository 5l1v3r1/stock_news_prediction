Management forecasting $361 million of total net revenue in 2018.\nTORONTO, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IBI Group Inc. (the \"Company\") (TSX:IBG) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nKEY EVENTS\nThis quarter, net income was $7.6 million compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2017. Net revenue for the quarter decreased by 0.7% to $90.8 million compared to $91.4 million for the same period in 2017, as a result of foreign exchange losses and a slight decrease in U.S. operational results. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the quarter increased 52.17% to $3.5 million compared to $2.3 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 million (or 10.1% of revenue) for the quarter compared to $10.2 million (or 11.1% of revenue) for the same period in 2017, which reflects a decrease of $1.1 million or 10.8%. During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the increase in cash outflows related to a lease of $1.0 million. The Company finalized its sub-lease agreement for one of its office spaces in 2017, at which point, an increase in rent expense was recognized as part of net earnings, but not included in adjusted EBITDA in 2017. The cash outflows related to the lease have the opposite effect, with no impact to net earnings but a reduction to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Interest expense decreased to $2.5 million for the quarter compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2017.\n“We are focused on growing revenue, strengthening our balance sheet and sustaining our debt reduction measures. Our EBITDA margins, net income, and cash flow puts us in a position to improve our base business and invest in technology offerings in 2018. We are excited to announce details of our technology pivot at the Annual Meeting of shareholders on Thursday, May 10, 2018. With society changing at a rapid pace, we believe our pivot will set IBI Group apart from our competitors and position the Company to benefit from evolving technology,” said Scott Stewart, Chief Executive Officer, IBI Group Inc.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED\nMARCH 31, (in thousands of Canadian dollars except for per share amounts) 2018\n(unaudited) 2017\n(unaudited) Number of working days 62 63 Gross Revenue $ 111,329 $ 117,588 Less: Subconsultants and direct costs 20,514 26,222 Net Revenue $ 90,815 91,366 Net income $ 7,556 $ 3,918 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 3,473 $ 2,263 Basic and diluted earnings per share $ 0.20 $ 0.10 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 9,143 $ 10,160 Adjusted EBITDA 1 as a percentage of revenue 10.1 % 11.1 % 1 See “Definition of Non-IFRS Measures” defined in MD&A. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nNet revenue for the quarter was $90.8 million, compared with $91.4 million in the same period in 2017, a decrease of 0.7%. The decrease is due to the impact of foreign exchange losses on revenues of $0.6 million, as well as a decrease in operational results in the U.S. for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe Company had net income of $7.6 million compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of 94.9%. The increase in net income is inclusive of a gain in fair value of other financial liabilities of $4.1 million, compared to a loss in fair value of other financial liabilities of $0.3 million in the same period in 2017, as well as inclusive of a loss foreign exchange of $0.6 million. The foreign exchange loss during the quarter reflects the movement in the market value of the Canadian Dollar.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $0.20 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.10 per share for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $3.7 million, which was slightly offset by an increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding to 31,209,776 as of quarter end compared to 31,188,486 for the same period in 2017. The increase in common shares outstanding is a result of the exercise of deferred share units and stock options.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $9.1 million (or 10.1% of revenue) this quarter compared to $10.2 million (or 11.1% of revenue) for the same period in 2017, which reflects a decrease of 10.8%. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by a $1.0 million increase in cash outflows stemming from the renegotiation of the sublease related to the onerous lease at the end of 2017. The Company recognized the expense as part of net earnings in 2017 at the time of the sub-lease renegotiation and subsequent onerous lease provision revaluation but had no impact on adjusted EBITDA in the same period in 2017.\nOUTLOOK\nManagement is forecasting approximately $361 million in total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company currently has approximately $335 million of work that is committed and under contract for the next five years. The Company has approximately eleven months of backlog (calculated on the basis of the current pace of work that the Company has achieved during the 12 months ended March 31, 2018).\nINVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company invites you to join its conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.
