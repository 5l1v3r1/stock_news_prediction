Her appointment comes after a Monday evening report in the New Yorker in which four women with whom he had been romantically involved alleged Mr. Schneiderman physically abused them.\nIn a statement Monday, Mr. Schneiderman said he hadn’t engaged in nonconsensual sex with the women. In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr. Schneiderman said that although the allegations “are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time.”\nHe said his resignation would take effect later Tuesday.\nLate Monday, a spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said the office had opened an investigation into the allegations against Mr. Schneiderman.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at a news conference April 3.

Before that, she served as counsel and chief assistant to the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She has argued 20 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, the biography says.\nUnder state law, members of New York’s Senate and Assembly will choose Mr. Schneiderman’s permanent successor by joint ballot.\nMr. Schneiderman had repeatedly sued President Donald Trump, a Republican, and had been an outspoken proponent of women’s issues, including access to contraception and abortion. In an email, the attorney general’s office spokeswoman said, “The work continues.”\nWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T00:21:52.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
