The board on April 19 approved a fiscal turnaround plan that included pension cuts and labor reforms, which Rossello has said he will refuse to implement.\nThe plan forecasts $6.7 billion in debt payment ability for Puerto Rico through fiscal year 2023. But Rossello’s proposed budget does not allocate for debt service, while including other expenses that are not in the plan, like $100 million in municipal spending.\nThe budget also did not eliminate Christmas bonuses for public servants or include labor reforms demanded by the board.\nIf Rossello refuses to implement parts of the plan, the board could sue for enforcement, putting yet another piece of the embattled island’s financial future in the hands of a judge.\nThursday’s letter escalated a war of words between the board and Rossello’s administration.\nThe board criticized Puerto Rican officials who had earlier accused it of failing to consult with the government on a timeline for budget development, saying it had “shared more than seven letters on the topic with various government officials.”\nPuerto Rico Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario Cortes said in a statement on Thursday night that the board dislikes the plan because it does not include an increased budget for the board’s own expenses.\n“An increase in the $60 million that they already have is not justified,” Rosario Cortes said.\nHe added, “We reject any attempt by the to acquire powers it does not possess through joint budget resolutions,” invoking a longstanding position in the Rossello administration that the board is attempting to encroach on the island’s right to make its own laws.\nReporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:00:31.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
