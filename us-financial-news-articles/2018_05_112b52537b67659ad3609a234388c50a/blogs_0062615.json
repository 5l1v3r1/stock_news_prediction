This was preceded by a 0.5% increase in March.\nThe 0.6% increase stands in stark contrast to the very beginning of the year, when the Department of Commerce reported that consumer spending gained a measly 0.2% in January, or a loss of 0.1% when adjusted for inflation.\nThe rise in spending was accompanied by a 0.3% increase in the purchase of durable goods, as well as a 0.9% increase in spending on non-durable goods.\nWhile consumer spending rose, so did the strength of the labor market; the unemployment rate reached 3.9% in April, a 17-year low , according to the Department of Labor. It also reported on Thursday that the week of May 26 saw a decrease of 13,000 unemployment insurance claims, from 234,000 to 221,000. The department will release a full unemployment report on Friday.
