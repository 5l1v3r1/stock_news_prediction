But yields fell, and were trading at 2.86 percent on Wednesday.\nIn the same month, Gross wrote in an investment outlook note that bond markets were like \"a hibernating bear awakening\" from a bull market driven by \"lower inflation and excessive central bank accommodation.\"\nTodd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA Research, said investors look to bond funds for capital preservation and income generation.\n\"When a fund fails to deliver it can catch investors off guard,\" he said. \"When Gross left Pimco assets failed to follow him. Unrewarded risk-taking fails to result in inflows.\"\nCalls and emails to Janus Henderson were not returned.
