It was sticking to its message that rates would probably need to rise - for only the second time in over a decade - once that recovery was clear.\n“What’s the sensible thing to do? Do you act now or do you wait to see evidence that that momentum is re-asserting,” Carney told reporters.\n“The judgement of the majority of the committee is you wait to see for some evidence of that reasserting.”\nInvestors slightly pushed back their bets on when rates would rise, and sterling slid close to a four-month low against the dollar while the yield on two-year British government bonds edged down.\nRate futures showed less than a 50 percent chance of a hike in August, the next time the BoE updates its forecasts.\n“It looks like the 2018 rate hike has been delayed not cancelled,” Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton said.\nBritain’s economy grew more slowly than most of its peers last year after a Brexit-driven jump in inflation hit consumer spending power and some businesses delayed long-term investment.\nGrowth slowed even more sharply in early 2018 on a mix of unusually icy weather and headwinds from Britain’s impending European Union exit.\nRecent data “had been consistent with a temporary soft patch...,” most of the BoE’s rate-setters said. “(But) there was value in seeing how the data unfolded over the coming months.”\nOVERHEATING RISK Despite weak growth, the BoE sees the need for rate hikes because it thinks the economy could overheat due to long-term weak productivity and lower immigration driven by Brexit.\nCarney said in February that rates might go up sooner than the BoE had previously suggested, and was asked by a reporter on Thursday about the description of him as an “unreliable boyfriend” - first used by a British lawmaker because of his previous signals about when rates might rise, which misfired.\n“The only people who throw that term at me are in this room,” Carney told the news conference.\nPolicymakers Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, who again voted for a rate rise, agreed the weak growth so far this year reflected “temporary or erratic factors”, but said delaying a rate hike risked more abrupt tightening later on.\nThe BoE said the weakening of inflation was due to a faster fading of the impact of sterling’s plunge on import prices, and domestic inflation pressures continued to rise.\nInflation was seen dropping to 2.1 percent in a year’s time, and returning to target a year later but only if interest rates rose by 25 basis points about three times over three years, as markets expect.\nThe BoE said the economy would grow by 1.4 percent this year, down from the 1.8 percent it predicted in February, with slowing consumer lending and a sluggish housing market creating greater-than-usual uncertainty about consumer demand.\nFor 2019 and 2020, it predicted growth of 1.7 percent, down from 1.8 percent in its February forecasts.\nFILE PHOTO: Pedestrians walk past the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain, May 15, 2014.
