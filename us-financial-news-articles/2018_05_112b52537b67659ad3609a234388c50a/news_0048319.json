He gave up three hits and walked two Thursday to boost his team-leading win total as the Rays snapped a three-game skid.\nWilson Ramos went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and Matt Duffy and Brad Miller each drove in a run for Tampa Bay, which has lost all but four of its 13 games against the AL East rival Red Sox this season.\nMitch Moreland hit a solo homer and Rafael Devers had an RBI for the Red Sox, who had won four straight and six of seven. Boston starter Rick Porcello (6-2) allowed six runs (four earned) on eight hits and two walks with two strikeouts in 3 2/3 innings.\nTampa Bay loaded the bases with nobody out in the first inning. Ramos then reached on a fielders’ choice after Red Sox catcher Sandy Leon couldn’t catch Porcello’s throw after an infield dribbler. Miller plated another run with a sacrifice fly.\nRamos knocked a two-run single in the second, with a third run scoring on a throwing error by Mookie Betts in right field. Duffy’s RBI single in the fourth made it 6-0.\nBoston finally scored in the seventh when Eduardo Nunez crossed the plate on a throwing error.\nMoreland gave the Red Sox late life with his seventh homer of 2018 in the ninth before Devers’ two-out RBI double. Rays closer Alex Colome came in for final out to notch his 11th save of the campaign.\nBoston activated right-hander Hector Velazquez from the 10-day disabled list and optioned lefty reliever Bobby Poyner to Triple-A Pawtucket earlier Thursday. Tampa Bay sent righty Yonny Chirinos (elbow) on a rehab assignment to Single-A Charlotte.\nBefore the game, Boston manager Alex Cora announced that second baseman Dustin Pedroia will be activated ahead of Friday’s series opener against Atlanta. Pedroia missed the first 50 games of the season recovering from left knee surgery.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:11:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
