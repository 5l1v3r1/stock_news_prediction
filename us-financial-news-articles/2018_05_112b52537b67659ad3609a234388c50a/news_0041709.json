The $39.4 billion increase in assets consisted of $36.7 billion in net income after all CPPIB costs and $2.7 billion in net Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions.\nThe investment portfolio achieved 10-year and five-year annualized net nominal returns of 8.0% and 12.1%, respectively. For the fiscal year, the investment portfolio returned 11.6% net of all CPPIB costs.\n“The Fund reached a new high of $356.1 billion at the end of our fiscal year due to continued strong equity markets,” said Mark Machin, President & Chief Executive Officer, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). “Soaring public equity markets through the first nine months of the fiscal year were the primary source of growth. As volatility returned during the fourth quarter, our private holdings proved resilient, adding significant value.”\nIn fiscal 2018, CPPIB continued to prudently execute its long-term investment strategy of seeking value-building growth while also diversifying the CPP Fund across multiple geographies and asset classes. All of CPPIB’s investment departments provided positive returns in the fiscal year.\n“Our investment teams continue to execute on diversification,” added Mr. Machin. “Our investment framework actively seeks to manage risk, maintain balance and help contribute to the sustainability of the CPP itself. While we don’t expect every investment department to produce gains in any given year by design, all our departments made strong contributions this fiscal year.”\nIn the five-year period up to and including fiscal 2018, CPPIB has now contributed $150.1 billion in cumulative net income to the Fund after all CPPIB costs. Since CPPIB’s inception in 1999, it has contributed $215.6 billion on a net basis.\n“While strong annual results are encouraging, we maintain a long-term perspective,” added Mr. Machin. “We fully expect that one year in 10, the value of the Fund will drop by at least 12.5%. The long-term investment horizon of the Fund means that we are well prepared to withstand short-term market declines in order to maximize long-term returns.”\nFive and 10-Year Returns 1, 2 (for the year ending March 31, 2018) Investment Rate of\nReturn (Nominal) Investment Rate of\nReturn (Real) Net Income 3 5-Year Annualized 12.1% 10.4% $150.1 billion 10-Year Annualized 8.0% 6.2% $183.3 billion 1 After all CPPIB costs. 2 Rates of return are calculated on a time-weighted basis. They reflect the performance of the Investment Portfolio, which excludes the Cash for Benefits Portfolio. 3 Dollar figures are cumulative. Long-Term Sustainability\nCPPIB’s 10-year annualized net nominal rate of return of 8.0%, or 6.2% on a net real rate of return basis, was above the Chief Actuary’s assumption of an average 3.9% return over the 75-year projection period of his report. The real rate of return is reported net of all CPPIB costs to be consistent with the Chief Actuary’s approach.\n“While periodic economic stress affecting global markets will place downward pressure on the Fund, our portfolio is designed to be resilient over longer periods and weather the ups and downs of multiple market cycles,” added Mr. Machin. “Through our investment programs, global footprint and top talent, we are helping to ensure that the CPP will be there for people who aren’t even born yet.”\nIn the most recent triennial review released in September 2016, the Chief Actuary of Canada reaffirmed that, as at December 31, 2015, the CPP remains sustainable at the current contribution rate of 9.9% throughout the forward-looking 75-year period covered by the actuarial report. The Chief Actuary’s projections are based on the assumption that the Fund’s prospective real rate of return, which takes into account the impact of inflation, will average 3.9% over the 75-year period.\nThe Chief Actuary’s report confirmed that the Fund’s performance was ahead of projections for the 2013-2015 period as investment income was 248%, or $70 billion, higher than anticipated.\nRelative Performance against the Reference Portfolio\nCPPIB also measures its performance against a market-based benchmark, the Reference Portfolio, representing a passive portfolio of public market indexes that reflect the level of long-term total risk that we believe is appropriate for the Fund.\nIn fiscal 2018, the Investment Portfolio’s net return of 11.6% outperformed the Reference Portfolio’s return of 9.8% by 1.8%. The Investment Portfolio’s single-year net dollar value-added return was $5.7 billion above the Reference Portfolio return, after deducting all costs from the Investment Portfolio and CPPIB’s operations.\nThe Investment Portfolio grows not only through the value added in single years but also through the compounding effect of continuous reinvestment of gains (or losses). We calculate compounded dollar value-added as the total net dollars CPPIB has added to the long-term Investment Portfolio through all sources of active management, above Reference Portfolio returns alone. CPPIB has generated $19.3 billion of compounded dollar value-added, after all costs, since the inception of active management at April 1, 2006.\n“Our active management strategy has added nearly $20 billion to the Fund since the start of the active management program in 2006, and created a more resilient portfolio by taking advantage of our comparative advantages,” said Mr. Machin. “Strong relative returns this year is certainly good to see, but we expect significant swings in performance relative to this benchmark in any single year because of our deliberate choice to build a prudently diversified portfolio beyond just public equities and bonds.”\nManaging CPPIB Costs\nCPPIB is committed to maintaining cost discipline. This fiscal year operating expense ratio is lower than both the fiscal 2016 and 2015 ratios, and remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2017. Importantly, our focus continues to be creating a global platform that will deliver value-building growth over the long term, after all costs.\nTo generate the $36.7 billion of net income from operations after all costs, CPPIB incurred costs of $3,192 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $2,834 million for the previous year. CPPIB costs for fiscal 2018 consisted of $1,053 million, or 31.5 basis points, of operating expenses; $1,029 million in management fees and $709 million in performance fees paid to external managers; and $401 million of transaction costs. CPPIB reports on these distinct cost categories, as each is materially different in purpose, substance and variability. We report the net investment income that our investment departments generate after deducting these fees and costs. We then report on total Fund performance net of these fees and costs, as well as CPPIB’s overall operating expenses.\nInvestment management fees increased primarily due to the strong returns generated by our external managers resulting in higher performance fees paid as well as the continued growth in the level of assets and commitments with external managers.\nTransaction costs decreased by $46 million compared to the prior year. Transaction costs vary from year to year as they are directly correlated to the number, size and complexity of our investing activities in any given period.\nPortfolio Performance by Asset Class\nPortfolio performance by asset class is included in the table below.\nA more detailed breakdown of performance by investment department is included in the CPPIB Annual Report for fiscal 2018, which is available at www.cppib.com .\nPORTFOLIO RETURNS 1 Asset Class Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 PUBLIC EQUITIES Canadian 2.2% 19.2% Foreign 11.0% 18.9% Emerging 18.6% 18.9% PRIVATE EQUITIES Canadian 1.8% 8.6% Foreign 16.0% 15.8% Emerging 19.5% 15.4% GOVERNMENT BONDS Marketable 1.6% (0.9%) Non-marketable 2.7% 1.8% CREDIT INVESTMENTS 6.9% 13.9% REAL ASSETS Real estate 9.4% 8.3% Infrastructure 15.2% 7.4% Other 2 (9.8)% 16.8% PERFORMANCE OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 3 11.9 % 12.2 % 1 Percentage returns are calculated and reported on a time-weighted unhedged Canadian dollar basis.
