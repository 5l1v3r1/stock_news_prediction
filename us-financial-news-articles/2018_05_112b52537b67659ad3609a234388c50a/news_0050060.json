Appleby, press secretary for Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, in an e-mail.\n\"The legislation proposed by the Governor and passed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly gives municipalities a workable option to ensure their residents aren't double taxed because of the Trump/GOP tax law,\" Appleby wrote.\n\"I remain committed to fighting the SALT deduction tax cap and am confident that the solution signed into law can and should be embraced by the IRS,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in an e-mailed statement.\n\"Make no mistake: We have been and will continue to fight against this economic missile with every fiber of our being,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in an e-mailed statement.\nUpcoming guidance Getty Images The proposed rules likely will clarify how the IRS will treat these transfers for tax purposes.\n\"The proposed regulations will assist taxpayers in understanding the relationship between the federal charitable contribution deduction and the new statutory limitation on the deduction for state and local tax payments,\" according to the IRS notice.\nTo put things in perspective, New Yorkers who claimed the SALT tax break took an average deduction of $22,169 in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center .
