(Nasdaq: APPS), the Company empowering operators and Original Equipment Manufacturers (\"OEMs\") around the globe with end-to-end mobile solutions, today announced the divestiture of its Content and Advertisers & Publishers (\"A&P\") businesses in two separate transactions. These divestitures sharpen Digital Turbine's strategic focus on its higher-growth and higher-margin Operators & OEMs (\"O&O\") business, which has generated revenue growth of 88% year-over-year during the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. The Company will benefit from a streamlined business model, simplified operating structure and enhanced management focus. Additionally, the Company expects to be able to generate additional cash via the announced transactions that can be re-invested into key O&O growth initiatives.\n\"The transactions announced today mark an important step in the Company's ongoing execution of its growth strategy, as they reflect our focused commitment to the core mobile delivery platform business with our operator and OEM partners,\" said Bill Stone, CEO. \"I am extremely excited about the inherent potential and market acceptance of our recently-enriched Mobile Delivery Platform. Now, with a singular focus to begin fiscal 2019, we are poised to ensure that we optimally capitalize on the wealth of opportunities directly in front of us.\"\n\"At the same time, the announced sales transactions represent a favorable exit strategy, as they provide the Company an opportunity to derive additional value from the divested business units via multi-year profit-sharing arrangements and equity participation rights in the divested Content business. While these businesses will no longer be a part of our operating business, the transaction terms announced today allow our shareholders to benefit both financially and strategically from potential synergies with our core O&O business in future years,\" concluded Mr. Stone.\nSale of Content Business\nOn April 29, 2018, Digital Turbine entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Chargewave Ptd Ltd., an Australia-based entity, to sell certain assets related to its direct carrier billing business.
