They reiterated their outperform rating on the stock.\nRSA’s shares rose 2.55 percent to 652 pence at 0748 GMT, outperforming a steady FTSE 100 index.\n$1 = 0.7376 pounds Reporting by Carolyn Cohn, Editing by Lawrence White and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:30:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
