The EBITDA from mining operations jumped to $7,604,000 compared to $ 951,000 for the same period in fiscal 2017. We are also pleased to announce a positive net income of $ 3,759,000 or $0.02 per share for Q2. The Company’s results from mining operations has significantly improved as a consequence of our new fixed-price contracts and strong market contract prices whilst costs continued to decrease, reflecting the continued strengthening of tungsten demand and price globally. The current Tungsten price is continuing to strengthen and sits significantly above the Q2 price received. With the signing of our newly-negotiated Sangdong off-take agreement, announced on March 13, 2018, we are now ready to finalize our US$85 million project financing and have already commenced the build-out of our Sangdong Mine located in South Korea. We are poised to have a very strong 2018 in both performance and growth with Q3 estimated to surpass the current Q2 results. Our graduation to the TSX is on track as per our previous press release.”\nAbout Almonty\nThe principal business of Toronto, Canada-based Almonty Industries Inc. is the mining, processing and shipping of tungsten concentrate from its Los Santos Mine in western Spain and its Panasqueira mine in Portugal as well as the refurbishment of its Wolfram Camp Mine in north Queensland, Australia, the development of its Sangdong tungsten mine in Gangwon Province, South Korea and the development of the Valtreixal tin/tungsten project in north western Spain. The Los Santos Mine was acquired by Almonty in September 2011 and is located approximately 50 kilometres from Salamanca in western Spain and produces tungsten concentrate. The Wolfram Camp Mine was acquired by Almonty in September 2014 and is located approximately 130 kilometres west of Cairns in northern Queensland, Australia and has produced tungsten and molybdenum concentrate, although the Wolfram Camp Mine is not currently producing due to ongoing refurbishment of the processing plant. The Panasqueira mine, which has been in production since 1896, is located approximately 260 kilometres northeast of Lisbon, Portugal, was acquired in January 2016 and produces tungsten concentrate. The Sangdong mine, which was historically one of the largest tungsten mines in the world and one of the few long-life, high-grade tungsten deposits outside of China, was acquired in September 2015 through the acquisition of a 100% interest in Woulfe Mining Corp. Almonty owns 100% of the Valtreixal tin-tungsten project in north-western Spain.
