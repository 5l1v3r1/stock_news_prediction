There is no deal yet to be sure, and it’s probably going to take a while to process, but they’re coming to play.\n“I believe they want to make a deal. And we will help them, we will guide them toward our own asks,” he added.\nKudlow also said the Chinese had offered a proposal to reduce their trade gap with the United States by more than $200 billion. He cited the energy and farming sectors in particular.\n“The number is a good number,” Kudlow said. “I think, just as important, they have to lower their tariff rates, they have to lower their non-tariff barriers and we have to have a verifiable process whereby the technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property stops. It has to be verifiable.” (Reporting By Steve Holland; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:34:12.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
