International investors want to see higher rates to rein in double-digit inflation and have dumped the lira on concerns about Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy.\n“Was it a late decision? Yes. The currency would not have to trade at these levels if this hike was carried out earlier,” said one senior official from Erdogan’s ruling AK Party.\nThe ministers believed that it was not just the currency at stake - even though the lira had fallen by about a fifth this year - but the need to prevent “permanent damage” to the economy, one of the sources said.\nThey agreed on the need for rate increase to calm the lira, and then conveyed that message to Yildirim, at a separate meeting later on Monday, the sources said.

No one was immediately available to comment at the central bank, the prime minister’s office or the presidency. ‘NOT SO KEEN’\nMore talks followed on Tuesday, where additional potential steps to arrest the lira decline was discussed.\nYildirim ultimately broached the topic of a rate hike with Erdogan on Wednesday at their weekly meeting - a full two days after hearing from the ministers about the need for the increase. By then the lira was falling fast, tumbling more than 5 percent at one point.\n“The need for a rate hike was clearly conveyed,” said one of the sources. “Other bureaucrats also took part in the meeting. We know Erdogan was not so keen on this idea.”\nA former transport minister and an Erdogan loyalist, Yildirim’s ties to the president date back to the 1990s, when he ran a ferry company in Istanbul, where Erdogan was mayor.

Instead, he is running for parliament.\nMuch of the lira’s selloff was sparked by Erdogan’s own comments last week that he expected to assert more monetary policy control after the June 24 parliamentary and presidential elections.\nThe most popular, but also divisive, politician in modern Turkish history, Erdogan has overseen strong economic growth in his 15 years in power but, more recently, also a deepening social crackdown.\nThe rate hike, announced late on Wednesday, was something of a victory for Simsek, a former Wall Street banker seen as one of the most investor-friendly faces in the cabinet.\nSimsek said on Twitter that it was “high time” that Turkey restored monetary policy credibility, comments that initially helped the lira strengthen.\n“His tweets were the clearest messages recently. Simsek’s statement also boosted the impact of the central bank’s decisions,” said the AKP official.\nThe boost from the central bank move has proved short-lived, with the lira giving up a big slice of the gains on Thursday, as investors bet that more rate hikes will be needed.\nSince then, the lira has continued to weaken as investors bet that the 3 percentage point increase will not be enough to tame inflation, and that the central bank will hike again at its next scheduled policy meeting on June 7.\n“There can be another attack on the lira before (then)...,” said the AKP official. “We must be ready for this.” Reporting by David Dolan; Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay; Writing by David Dolan and Dominic Evans; editing by John Stonestreet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:21:38.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
