The couple had been married for 73 years.\n“His doctors report he is doing well and is happy to return home,” spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement.\nBush, who was president from 1989 to 1993, was admitted to the same hospital about a year ago for a cough that was later diagnosed as a mild case of pneumonia.\nBush is the father of former Republican President George W. Bush, who served two terms from 2001 to 2009, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who unsuccessfully sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
