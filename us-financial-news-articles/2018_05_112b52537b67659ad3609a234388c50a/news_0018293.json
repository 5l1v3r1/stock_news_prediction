The contract topped out at $71.36 on Wednesday, the highest intraday level since November 2014.\nBrent crude oil also touched its highest since November 2014 at $77.43 on Wednesday.

Oil prices could rise at least $10, with Brent approaching near $90,\" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.\nAll key crude oil futures contracts saw traded volumes jump as investors took new positions and refiners hedged to protect themselves from higher feedstock prices.\nMoving to ease market concerns, Saudi Arabia on Wednesday said it would work with other producers to lessen the impact of any shortage in oil supplies. The country has been leading efforts since 2017 to withhold production to prop up prices.\nU.S. crude oil production rose to another high at 10.7 million barrels a day, according to EIA's preliminary weekly reading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T04:26:05.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
