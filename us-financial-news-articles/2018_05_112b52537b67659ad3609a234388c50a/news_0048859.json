REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo IHS Markit’s Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), considered a gauge of economic health, slowed in May to an 18-month low of 54.1 from 55.1, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which predicted a reading of 55.0.\nJPMorgan said it has also cut its growth forecast for the second quarter of 2018 to 2.5 percent from 3 percent previously.\n“The level is still consistent with growth a tick above a 2 percent pace, which is in line with the latest ECB staff forecast. But, the trajectory remains a concern,” analysts for the bank said in a note.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, editing by Karin Strohecker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:24:03.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
