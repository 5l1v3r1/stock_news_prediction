WSJ did report, however, that “the partnership will extend into other services including Goldman offering in-store loans to Apple customers buying iPhones and other gadgets.”\nIn 2016, Goldman Sachs expanded into consumer banking with Marcus by Goldman Sachs , which offers financial services like personal loans. It also purchased the financial planning app Clarity Money earlier this year. A credit card would be another arm in the investment banking firm’s play toward consumer finance.\nFor Apple, the goal is to burnish other services outside of retail, according to WSJ. Apple Pay was launched by Apple in 2014, and though it has grown in users year-over-year, according to 9to5Mac , a 2018 report from the venture capital firm Loup Ventures estimates that only 5% of U.S. iPhones have Apple Pay activated.\nApple has had a rewards card with Barclays , which offered 0% interest and a limited APR of 0% for 6 to 18 months and Apple gift card rewards. The new card with Goldman Sachs will replace that, according to WSJ .\nBoth Goldman Sachs and Apple declined to comment about the Wall Street Journal report to Fortune.
