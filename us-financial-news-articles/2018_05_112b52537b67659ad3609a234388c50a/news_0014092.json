(\"Millennial\" or the \"Company\") (TSX VENTURE:GAME) (OTCQB:MLLLF), a mobile video game publisher focused on Esports and Racing, today announced that movie studio production executive Doug Belgrad has resigned from the Company’s board of directors to devote his full time and attention to his film and television production company. As Millennial’s strategic focus is now solidly on mobile Esports and racing themes, a search for a new Board Member who brings unique expertise and experience in these areas is underway.\n“With the acquisition of Eden Games, we have refocused our strategy and our operations on the growth potential in the Esports Racing sector,” said Millennial Esports CEO, Alex Igelman. “Doug has been a valued member of our Board bringing his studio experience to the Company. With the growth of his own production company, and with our shift in focus to the unique opportunity we see in mobile Esports and racing, we fully understand his desire to devote his full time and attention to 2.0 Entertainment and wish him every success for the future there.”\n“I have thoroughly enjoyed serving on the Board of Millennial. However, as the obligations at 2.0 Entertainment have grown and the focus at Millennial has shifted, I have less time than I would like to devote to the Board and development of Millennial,” noted Mr. Belgrad, “I wish Millennial great success going forward and also will look forward to potential collaboration as projects of mutual interest arise.”\nAbout Millennial Esports Corp.\nMillennial Esports Corp.
