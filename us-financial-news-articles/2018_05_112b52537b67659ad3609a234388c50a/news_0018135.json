Excluding special items, first quarter earnings totaled $1.30 per diluted share. The Company also reported revenue of $1.3 billion for the quarter, an increase of 5 percent compared to the respective equivalent prior period, on an adjusted basis.\nPrior to December 4, 2017, Delphi Technologies operated as the Powertrain Systems segment of Delphi Automotive PLC (the \"former parent\") and the historical financial information presented in this press release for periods prior to December 4, 2017 were derived from the former parent's accounting records and are presented on a carve-out basis as if Delphi Technologies had operated as a stand-alone company for all periods presented.\nFirst quarter highlights\nRevenue of $1.3 billion, up 5% (*) year-on-year U.S. GAAP net income of $98 million, diluted earnings per share of $1.10 Excluding special items, earnings of $1.30 per diluted share U.S. GAAP operating income of $138 million, or 10.6% margin Adjusted operating income of $159 million, or 12.3% margin Generated $75 million of cash from operating activities Quarterly dividend payment of $15 million\n(*) Adjusted for currency exchange and certain aftermarket revenue retained by the former parent\nFull year outlook raised\nThe company has raised its full year outlook for 2018. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $5.0 - $5.2 billion, up $100 million from the company's prior outlook range. Adjusted Operating Income margin is now expected to be in the range of 12.3% - 12.5%, up 10 basis points from the company's prior outlook range. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $4.65 - $4.95, up $0.15 from the company's prior outlook range.\nCEO comments\n\"Delphi Technologies had a strong start to 2018. We delivered 5% revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and have raised our full year outlook. We continue to have robust bookings momentum in key technologies that will support our long-term growth. Led by our industry leading portfolio, focused on solving our customers most complex propulsion challenges, we saw $3 billion of bookings in Q1,\" said Liam Butterworth, President and Chief Executive Officer for Delphi Technologies. \"In our first full quarter as a public company, we also made strong operational progress. Our teams remain highly focused on disciplined execution and pioneering innovation across the range of propulsion technologies in order to consistently deliver value to our customers and shareholders.\"\nFirst quarter 2018 results\nThe Company reported first quarter 2018 revenue of $1.3 billion, an increase of 11% from the prior year period. Adjusted for currency exchange and certain aftermarket original equipment service revenue retained by the former parent, revenue increased by 5% during the period. This reflects growth of 4% in Powertrain Systems and 1% in Delphi Technologies Aftermarket. It also reflects growth of 11% in Asia, 6% in North America, 6% in South America and relatively flat performance in Europe.\nThe Company reported first quarter 2018 U.S. GAAP net income of $98 million and net income of $1.10 per diluted share, compared to $103 million and $1.16 per diluted share in the prior year period. First quarter Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, totaled $116 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, which compares to Adjusted Net Income in the prior year period of $116 million, or $1.31 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter U.S. GAAP operating income was $138 million, compared to $148 million in the prior year period. Adjusted Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was $159 million, compared to $162 million in the prior year period. Adjusted Operating Income margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 12.3%, compared to 13.9% in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a commercial settlement that benefited the first quarter of 2017 and, to a lesser degree, spin-related costs associated with becoming a stand-alone public company. Depreciation and amortization expense (including asset impairment charges) totaled $50 million in the first quarter as compared to $48 million in the prior year period.\nInterest expense for the first quarter totaled $20 million, as compared to $1 million in the prior year period, which reflects the interest related to the issuance of $1,550 million of debt during 2017 in connection with the separation.\nU.S. GAAP tax expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $22 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 18%, compared to $31 million, or an effective rate of 22%, in the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the impacts of favorable changes in geographic income mix.\nThe Company generated net cash flow from operating activities of $75 million in the first quarter, compared to $16 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures totaled $66 million in the first quarter, compared to $51 million in the prior year period.\nReconciliations of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Share, Adjusted Operating Income and Cash Flow Before Financing, which are non-GAAP measures, to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") are provided in the attached supplemental schedules.\nRevised full year 2018 outlook\nThe Company's full year 2018 financial guidance is as follows:\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nFull Year 2018\nRevenue\n$5,000 - $5,200\nAdjusted operating income margin\n12.3% - 12.5%\nAdjusted earnings per share\n$4.65 - $4.95\nCash flow from operations\n$440 - $480\nCapital expenditures\n$280 - $300\nAdjusted effective tax rate\n16% - 17%\nKey non-GAAP reconciliation items to the projected 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per\nshare are as follows:\nEarnings Per Share\nEstimated separation charges\n$0.70 - $0.75\nEstimated charges for restructuring\n$0.89 - $0.94\nConference call and webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 8:30 a.m. (ET) / 1:30 p.m. (BST) today, which is accessible by dialing 866.761.8621 (US domestic) or 703.925.2612 (international) or through a webcast at http://ir.delphi.com .

Visit delphi.com .\nUse of non-GAAP financial information\nThis press release contains information about Delphi Technologies' financial results which are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring, separation costs and asset impairments. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of Net sales.\nAdjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Delphi Technologies before restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by operating activities plus cash used in investing activities. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nSuch non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release, as well as other statements made by Delphi Technologies PLC (the \"Company\"), contain that reflect, when made, the Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance and, in particular, the Company's 2018 outlook. Such are subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to the Company's operations and business environment, which may cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from any future results. All statements that address future operating, financial or business performance or the Company's strategies or expectations are . In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"potential,\" \"outlook\" or \"continue,\" the negatives thereof and other comparable terminology. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these include, but are not limited to, the following: global and regional economic conditions, including conditions affecting the credit market and those resulting from the United Kingdom referendum held on June 23, 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"; risks inherent in operating as a global company, such as, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and economic, political and trade conditions around the world; the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production; the potential disruptions in the supply of and changes in the competitive environment for raw material integral to the Company's products; the Company's ability to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations; potential changes to beneficial free trade laws and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement; the ability of the Company to achieve the intended benefits from its separation from its former parent or from acquisitions the Company may make; the ability of the Company to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives; the ability of the Company to avoid or continue to operate during a strike, or partial work stoppage or slow down by any of its unionized employees or those of its principal customers; the ability of the Company to attract and retain customers; changes in the costs of raw materials; the Company's indebtedness, including the amount thereof and capital availability and cost; the cost and outcome of any claims, legal proceedings or investigations; the failure or breach of information technology systems; severe weather conditions and natural disasters and any resultant disruptions on the supply or production of goods or services or customer demands; acts of war and/or terrorism, as well as the impact of actions taken by governments as a result of further acts or threats of terrorism; and the timing and occurrence (or non-occurrence) of other events or circumstances that may be beyond our control.\nAdditional factors are discussed under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect the Company.
