(NASDAQ:CWST), a regional solid waste, recycling and resource management services company, today reported its financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. In addition, the Company reaffirms its revenues, Adjusted EBITDA*, and Normalized Free Cash Flow* guidance ranges for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the 2018:\nRevenues were $147.5 million for the quarter, up $13.7 million, or 10.2%, from the same period in 2017. Net loss was $(3.9) million for the quarter, an increase of $(3.7) million from the same period in 2017. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders* was $0.1 million for the quarter, down $(0.2) million from the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.6 million for the quarter, up $1.5 million, or 6.4%, from the same period in 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 million for the quarter, up $2.1 million, or 19.8%, from the same period in 2017. Normalized Free Cash Flow was $7.2 million for the quarter, up $6.1 million, or 529.5%, from the same period in 2017. Overall solid waste pricing for the quarter was up 4.3%, driven by strong landfill pricing, up 4.9%, and robust collection pricing, up 4.8%.\n“We had another strong operational quarter, as we continued to execute well against our key strategies,” said John W. Casella, Chairman and CEO of Casella Waste Systems, Inc. “We remain focused on creating shareholder value through increasing landfill returns, improving collection profitability, creating incremental value through resource solutions, driving general and administrative efficiencies, and strong capital discipline.”\n“The progress we have made on our strategies is apparent in the positive financial results in the first quarter, despite significant recycling headwinds,” Casella said. “Our disciplined solid waste pricing programs continued to add value, with landfill pricing up 4.9% and collection pricing up 4.8%. This strong pricing was coupled with 6.6% solid waste volume growth, mainly driven by robust disposal volume growth. Roughly 60% of our disposal volume growth during the quarter was driven by a one-time $3.5 million soil remediation project for a key customer and the remaining 40% was driven by higher landfill volumes across all waste types as we continued to source new landfill volumes at higher prices in the tightening northeastern disposal markets.\"\n“Commodity pricing for recycled paper and cardboard continued to deteriorate during the first quarter due to China’s ban on mixed paper and new lower contamination standards,” Casella said. “Our average commodity revenue per ton was down roughly 50% year-over-year, with mixed paper pricing down over 90% during this same period. Our risk mitigation programs are working well to help offset this historic decline in commodity prices. However, several factors contributed to an under-recovery during the quarter, including: the rapid sequential decline in commodity prices from December to March caused our recovery fees to get behind due to their calculation based on a one-month trailing index; we are absorbing all of the commodity pricing risk on several legacy contracts, which make up roughly 15% of our commodity sales; and our variable costs were up as we had to slow processing lines to improve quality while we incurred higher transportation costs to deliver commodities to new markets. Given these headwinds, recycling operating income missed budget by roughly $2.0 million during the quarter.”\n“As we first announced in early August 2017, we have adjusted our capital strategy to balance delevering with prudent growth through acquisition or development investments,” Casella said. “We have set a goal to grow revenues by $20.0 million to $40.0 million per year through acquisition or development activity for the next three years as part of this new strategy. We are off to a great start with this strategy, with roughly $20.0 million of acquired revenues over the last four months. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we believe that investing a portion of our excess cash flows to grow our business will create additional shareholder returns through higher cash flows driven by new revenue streams, internalization to our disposal facilities and cost synergies.”\nFor the quarter, revenues were $147.5 million, up $13.7 million, or 10.2%, from the same period in 2017, with revenues growth mainly driven by: robust collection and disposal pricing; higher solid waste volumes; higher organics and customer solutions volumes; and the roll-over impact from acquisitions; partially offset by lower recycling commodity prices and volumes.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $(3.9) million, or $(0.09) per diluted common share for the quarter, an increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(3.7) million, as compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per diluted common share for the same period in 2017. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders was $0.1 million for the quarter, or Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share* of $0.00 for the quarter, as compared to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders of $0.3 million, or Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share of $0.01 for the same period in 2017.\nThe first quarter included: a $2.1 million contract settlement charge related to the termination of a recycling brokerage contract, exiting the contract has a positive return for the Company; a $1.6 million Southbridge Landfill closure charge primarily related to a reserve established for an expected settlement with the Town of Charlton; and a $0.3 million development project charge associated with certain costs incurred at our North Country Landfill.\nOperating income was $0.8 million for the quarter, as compared to operating income of $6.6 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted Operating Income was $4.8 million for the quarter, down $(1.7) million from the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.6 million for the quarter, up $1.5 million from the same period in 2017, with growth mainly driven by improved performance in the Company's collection and disposal lines-of-business, partially offset by a decline in the recycling line-of-business.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 million for the quarter, as compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2017. Normalized Free Cash Flow was $7.2 million for the quarter, as compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nOutlook\n“While we have modeled recycling commodity prices to stay flat at the current historically low levels for the remainder of 2018, we remain confident that our outperformance in the solid waste, organics and customer solutions businesses will continue to more than offset this headwind,” Casella said. “As such, we have reaffirmed our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Normalized Free Cash Flow guidance ranges for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.”\nThe estimated ranges are as follows:\nRevenues between $618 million and $628 million;\nAdjusted EBITDA between $135 million and $139 million; and\nNormalized Free Cash Flow between $42 million and $46 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Normalized Free Cash Flow related to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 are described in the Reconciliation of 2018 Outlook Non-GAAP Measures section of this press release.\nConference call to discuss quarter\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
