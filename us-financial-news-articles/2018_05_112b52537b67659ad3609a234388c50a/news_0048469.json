Shares in Hypera have fallen 22 percent since the raid.\nThree outside executives will serve on the independent committee that will hire a law firm and audit firm to investigate, the company said in an exchange filing.\nHypera in April said that the police investigation was a result of a plea bargain testimony of a former executive, Nelson Jose de Mello.\nDomestic newspaper Valor Economico reported last month that Hypera’s chairman and controlling shareholder, Joao Alves de Queiroz Filho, and former Chief Executive Claudio Bergamo, were in talks to reach plea deals. Both have resigned from their corporate roles at the company.\nReporting by Flavia Bohone Writing by Jake Spring; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:30:40.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
