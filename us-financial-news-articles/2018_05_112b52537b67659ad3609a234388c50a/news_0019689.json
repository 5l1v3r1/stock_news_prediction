A further 10 malls are scheduled for development, the website shows.\nHowever, Saudi Arabia’s retail market has been hurt in recent months by sluggish consumer spending as VAT, energy subsidy cuts and rising interest rates dent disposable income.\nThe drawdown of the second tranche of the facility for Arabian Centres will depend on the pace of development of the new malls, one of the sources said.\nSamba Financial Group, National Commercial Bank, Al Rajhi Bank and Arab National Bank provided the loan, the company said.
