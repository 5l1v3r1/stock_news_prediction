Not that any of us are designers, but they haven't asked for our input.\" show chapters 9:50 AM ET Fri, 20 April 2018 | 03:26\n\"Miami is a super-cool place and I was very excited to hear about it, but when I saw the layout I was like, meh. I think it could be a lot more fun,\" he added.\nMiami city officials voted in favor of the F1 proposal on Thursday and it's expected the race would be in addition to the U.S. Grand Prix, which has taken place in Austin, Texas, since 2012 and was won by Hamilton on five of those six occasions.\nDespite the reservations of the four-time world champion, the unanimous decision of the City of Miami Commission and Miami-Dade County was welcomed by the sport.\n\"Formula 1 in Miami represents a fantastic opportunity to bring the greatest racing spectacle on the planet to one of the world's most iconic cities, and we are delighted that the journey is underway,\" said Sean Bratches, F1's commercial managing director. show chapters 10:12 AM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 05:39\nMiami City Commissioner Ken Russell gave a potential sneak preview of the location and layout of the track on social media last week.
