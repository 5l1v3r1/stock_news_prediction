(NASDAQ: CLNE) (\"Clean Energy\" or the \"Company\") today announced its operating results for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company delivered 85.1 million gallons in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Growth in CNG volumes was offset principally by a reduction in LNG volumes due to the non-renewal of two contracts and RNG volumes for non-vehicle fuel that were included in contracts sold to BP, as noted below.\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $102.4 million, a 14.4% increase from $89.5 million of revenue for the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to $25.5 million in revenue from the U.S. federal excise tax credits for alternative fuels (\"AFTC\"). The AFTC, which had previously expired on December 31, 2016, was reinstated on February 9, 2018 to apply to vehicle fuel sales made from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a lower effective price per gallon, largely attributable to the effects of the Company's sale of certain assets related to the upstream production portion of its RNG business to BP Products North America Inc. (\"BP\") at the end of the first quarter of 2017 (the \"BP Transaction\"), which has resulted in decreased revenue from the sale of certain tradable credits the Company generates by selling CNG, LNG and its Redeem™ RNG vehicle fuel. Station construction revenue decreased between periods, principally due to fewer projects in process in the current period compared to a year ago. Additionally, the combination of our former compressor business (“CEC”) with Landi Renzo's compressor business, SAFE, in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted in CEC no longer being consolidated in the Company’s financial results and instead being reported as an equity method investment in first quarter of 2018, which also decreased reported revenue in the period.\nAndrew J. Littlefair, Clean Energy's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated \"Our financial performance in the first quarter was solid, and in line with our expectations, as we believe we are realizing the benefits of optimizing our station network, the Landi Renzo CEC combination and the reinstatement of the AFTC for 2017. We believe our clean natural gas and renewable natural gas for transportation fuel are very attractive solutions to getting to zero emissions now.\"\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.2 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to net income of $61.1 million, or $0.40 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 was positively impacted by AFTC revenue of $25.5 million. The first quarter of 2017 was positively affected by gains of $3.2 million and $70.6 million, respectively, from the Company's repurchase of a portion of its outstanding debt at a discount to the face amount and the BP Transaction.\nNon-GAAP income per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.10 and $32.4 million, respectively, which included the AFTC revenue recognized in the period. Non-GAAP income per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was $0.41 and $80.8 million, respectively, which included the gains from the debt repurchase and the BP Transaction in the period.\nNon-GAAP income per share and Adjusted EBITDA are described below and reconciled to GAAP net income and income per share attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures that it calls non-GAAP income per share (\"non-GAAP EPS\" or \"non-GAAP income per share\") and adjusted EBITDA (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Management presents non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance, for the following reasons: (1) these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management, as management uses these measures to assess the Company’s operating performance and for financial and operational decision-making; (2) these measures exclude the impact of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; and (3) these measures are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company’s business. In future quarters, the Company may make adjustments for other expenditures, charges or gains in order to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company’s management believes are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described below (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company’s management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described below. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to GAAP income, GAAP income per share or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company's presentation of non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nNon-GAAP EPS\nNon-GAAP EPS, which the Company presents as a non-GAAP measure of its performance, is defined as net income attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp., plus stock-based compensation expense, plus (minus) loss (income) from equity method investments, the total of which is divided by the Company’s weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis. The Company’s management believes excluding non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance because of the varying available valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside of management’s control), the subjectivity of the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use under the relevant accounting guidance, which may obscure trends in a company’s core operating performance. Similarly, the Company's management believes that excluding the non-cash results from equity method investments is useful to investors because the charges are not part of or representative of the core operations of the Company.\nThe table below shows GAAP and non-GAAP EPS and also reconciles GAAP net income attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. to an adjusted net income figure used in the calculation of non-GAAP EPS:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, (in thousands, except share and per-share amounts) 2017 2018 Net Income Attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. $ 61,059 $ 12,222 Stock-Based Compensation 1,910 1,898 Loss from equity method investments 36 1,468 Adjusted Net Income $ 63,005 $ 15,588 Diluted Weighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding 152,972,153 156,643,092 GAAP Income Per Share $ 0.40 $ 0.08 Non-GAAP Income Per Share $ 0.41 $ 0.10 Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, which the Company presents as a non-GAAP measure of its performance, is defined as net income attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp., plus (minus) income tax expense (benefit), plus interest expense, minus interest income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus stock-based compensation expense, and plus (minus) loss (income) from equity method investments. The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance for the same reasons discussed above with respect to non-GAAP EPS. In addition, management internally uses Adjusted EBITDA to determine elements of executive and employee compensation.\nThe table below shows Adjusted EBITDA and also reconciles this figure to GAAP net income attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp.:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, (in thousands) 2017 2018 Net Income Attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. $ 61,059 $ 12,222 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) (2,263 ) 88 Interest Expense 4,911 4,503 Interest Income (192 ) (575 ) Depreciation and Amortization 15,317 12,801 Stock-Based Compensation 1,910 1,898 Loss from equity method investments 36 1,468 Adjusted EBITDA $ 80,778 $ 32,405 Definition of \"Gallons Delivered\"\nThe Company defines “gallons delivered” as its gallons of renewable natural gas (\"RNG\"), compressed natural gas (\"CNG\") and liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\"), along with its gallons associated with providing operations and maintenance services, in each case delivered to its customers in the applicable period, plus the Company's proportionate share of gallons delivered by joint ventures in the applicable period.\nThe table below shows gallons delivered for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Gallons Delivered (in millions) 2017 2018 CNG 68.5 70.8 RNG (1) 0.6 — LNG 16.0 14.3 Total 85.1 85.1 (1) Represents RNG sold as non-vehicle fuel,.
