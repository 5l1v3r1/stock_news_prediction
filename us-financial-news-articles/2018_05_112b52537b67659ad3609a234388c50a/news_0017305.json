Two of them have been found dead and two others rescued.\n“Rescue teams ... are progressing at a pace of several metres per hour. We’re narrowing the area where miners are located,” JSW’s chief executive, Daniel Ozon, told a news conference.\nFriends and relatives lit candles at the mine’s entrance, next to a banner reading “Miners of Zofiowka - We Are With You”.\n“My husband works here too, that is why my heart goes out to the families ... I would not like to be in their place,” said one woman who only gave her first mane, Malgorzata.\nAbout 250 people were working underground at the time of the quake. The missing miners were from a team drilling a new tunnel.\nThe 3.5-4.0 magnitude quake was the strongest recorded in the mine, officials there said.\nAround 83,000 people work in Poland’s coal mining sector. Last year 15 miners died, and another eight so far this year.
