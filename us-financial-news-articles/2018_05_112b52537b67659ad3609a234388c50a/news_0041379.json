It’s this moment in time, she says, that makes storytelling so vital. “I have to be honest that this is a very challenging time in my life as a Mexican immigrant who is an American citizen,” she writes. Her experience of America is so different than the vision of her parents, who first saw the country as a beacon for democracy and justice, then ultimately a country of complex contradictions. “[T]he work that I’m doing is part of the long arc of the role in general of people of color in this country to tell the stories, and to create the factual narrative, through journalism and through storytelling.” Hip Latina The woman behind one of the world’s most famous pictures I will confess this now: I am shocked I did not know this. Dorothea Lange’s 1936 photograph of a worried migrant mother became the most famous image of the Great Depression, yet for decades we knew nothing about the subject. (In fact, Lange never bothered to ask her name.) It turns out Florence Leona Christie was Cherokee, born to two Cherokee parents displaced from their tribal lands in Oklahoma. By the time the photo was taken, she had six young children and her husband had just died of tuberculosis. Click through for more, but this snippet of lost history was brought to my attention by her great-grandson, James Brady. “The children [in the picture] are my Aunt Ruby and Aunt Norma,” he tweeted in a fascinating thread. In other news, Brady writes about sports for SB Nation, and refuses to use the Washington football team’s full name in his articles. Mashable Eve Ewing interviews Bomani Jones and it is exactly as good as you’d expect Two of raceAhead’s favorites are together at last – the academic and writer Ewing, and sports/society commentator Jones. Jones is about to launch a new show on ESPN; the two talked about his unexpected journey to the airwaves, and how his signature candor about race and the sports-industrial complex has played with the “just stick to sports” crowd. (Bomani became alt-famous when he wore a “Caucasians” shirt – a send-off of the Cleveland baseball team’s mascot – on the ESPN show Mike and Mike .) “Many viewers still think that these opinions have no place on a sports network, especially when they come from a black man,” says Ewing. Then she hands the mic to Jones. “The thorniness of the relationship between black athletes and the institutions that employ them—of need, of value, of power, of capitalist exchange, of bodies being laid on the line for the right price—is what’s generally missing from popular analyses,” he begins.
