The law had remained blocked pending the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood could yet ask a judge to reimpose the injunction blocking the law.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:03:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
