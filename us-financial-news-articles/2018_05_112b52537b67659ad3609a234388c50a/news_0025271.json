The new rule could also make brokers cautious about adding cost to investors, he said.\nThose difficulties, along with heightened investor awareness of the costs, could lead to a shift in the market, analysts said.\nOver the longer-term, individual investors could opt to replace their direct muni bond holdings with professionally managed portfolios, such as mutual funds or separately managed accounts (SMA).\n“If SMA assets start to grow at an even faster pace as a result of the mark-up rule, we might see demand for 5-10 (year) paper increase, as this part of the curve is preferred by SMAs,” Barclays municipal credit analyst Mikhail Foux said in a recent research note. That, in turn, would lead to a steepening yield curve, he added.\nFinancial advisers for investors, who sometimes buy individual bonds for clients, could also turn to larger investment management firms to handle those transactions due, in part, to the added burden of the new pricing disclosure rule, said Dawn Daggy-Mangerson, director of the muni bond team at McDonnell Investment Management in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois.\nThe next step will be explaining and defending the number to investors.
