REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\nOutput had slumped since November in response to falling domestic demand, especially for diesel models, and due to the changeover between older and newer cars.\nProduction for both domestic and overseas buyers rose in April, pushing total volumes to 127,952 units, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\n“While April’s growth isn’t altogether surprising given the significant decline in output this time last year, it is good to see earlier planned investment into new models delivering results,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.\nThe British automotive industry is concerned, however, that Brexit could see the loss of frictionless, tariff-free trade with its biggest export market.\n“The ability of UK plants to attract the next wave of new models and drive future growth depends upon maintaining these competitive conditions after Brexit,” said Hawes.
