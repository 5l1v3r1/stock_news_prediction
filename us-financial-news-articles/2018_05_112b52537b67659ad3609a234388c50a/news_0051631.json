REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\nThe Italian-American automaker said no injuries or crashes are related to the large recall campaign but said it had one report of a U.S. driver of a 2017 Dodge Journey rental car being unable to deactivate the cruise control.\nFiat Chrysler, which in 2015 was hit with penalties from U.S. regulators totaling $175 million for safety lapses, did not say how much the recalls would cost.\nThe recall addresses what Fiat Chrysler called an “extremely rare” series of events that could lead to drivers being unable to cancel cruise control, a electronic device that allows a vehicle to maintain a constant speed without driver intervention.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Friday it “strongly encourages vehicle owners to follow a warning” to stop using cruise control on the recalled vehicles until repaired.\nThe recall covers more than 4.8 million vehicles in the United States and 490,000 in Canada, regulators said.\nNHTSA said drivers could overpower the system by forcefully applying the brakes until the vehicle stopped. Fiat Chrysler also said the vehicle could be stopped by shifting into neutral and braking.\nFiat Chrysler shares were down 2 percent in afternoon trading in New York on the recall.

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\nFiat Chrysler said that at times cruise control systems automatically initiate acceleration to help vehicles maintain driver-selected speeds, including when going uphill. If an acceleration occurs simultaneously with a short-circuit in a specific electrical network, a driver could be unable to deactivate the function.\nFiat Chrysler said vehicles may be placed in park mode once stopped, at which point cruise-control is canceled.\nThe recall involves a group of gasoline-powered vehicles with automatic transmissions from various model years built from 2014 through the 2019 model year. Most of the vehicles being recalled cover the 2014-2018 model years.\nAmong the vehicles being recalled are the Chrysler 200, Chrysler 300, Chrysler Pacifica, Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Journey, Dodge Durango, Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Wrangler and Ram 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks and Ram 3500/4500/5500 cab chassis trucks.\nFiat Chrysler made the announcement going into the busy U.S. Memorial Day weekend, which traditionally kicks off the summer driving season in the United States.\nThe company said it is recalling an unspecified number of additional vehicles in Mexico and other markets, and recalling some Fiat Fremont vehicles built on the same platform as the Dodge Journey. The company said it was also warning owners in other markets not to use cruise control until recalls are completed.

We urge customers to follow the instructions on their recall notices.”\nFiat Chrysler said recall repairs would be free of charge and it would begin alerting affected customers as early as next week. The recalled vehicles have collectively been driven more than 200 billion miles.\nFiat Chrysler promised to improve safety procedures after being penalized by NHTSA in 2015 for safety lapses.\nIn July 2015, Fiat Chrysler agreed to a $105 million settlement for mishandling nearly two dozen recall campaigns covering 11 million vehicles. It agreed to a three-year consent agreement and monitoring by former Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. It was separately fined $70 million by U.S. regulators in 2015 for failing to report vehicle crash deaths and injuries since 2003.\nIn 2015, Fiat Chrysler booked a 602 million-euro ($705 million) after-tax charge, mainly for estimated future recall costs.
