(Nasdaq: PLSE), a medical technology company developing a proprietary therapeutic tissue treatment based on its Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) platform, today announced that the Company will report first quarter 2018 financial results and operational highlights on Tuesday, May 8, 2018. Pulse Biosciences management will host a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (PT).\nAnalysts and investors can participate in the conference call by dialing (844) 494-0190 (domestic) and (508) 637-5580 (international) using the conference ID# 4796365. The webcast of the conference call can be accessed live on the Investor Relations section of the Pulse Biosciences website at www.pulsebiosciences.com .\nAbout Pulse Biosciences\nPulse Biosciences is a clinical stage electroceutical, an electrical energy based therapeutic, company pursuing commercial applications of its proprietary Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) technology. NPS is a non-thermal, precise, focal, drug-free tissue treatment technology utilizing nanosecond (billionth of a second) range pulsed electric fields that directly affect the cell membrane and intracellular structures and initiates programmed cell death in treated cells. The unique ability of NPS to initiate cell death has the potential to significantly benefit patients in a wide variety of medical applications including applications in immuno-oncology and dermatology, and other potential applications we may pursue in the future. The initiation of programmed cell death by NPS results in a minimal inflammatory response, which improves healing outcomes and supports the replacement of treated tissue cells with healthy tissue cells. In cancerous lesions, NPS has been shown in preclinical models to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which exposes the unique antigens of the treated cells to the immune system and enrolls immune system cells, such as cytotoxic T-cells to mount an adaptive immune response. Pulse Biosciences is investigating a variety of applications for its technology that exploits the technologyâ€™s unique biologic effect, including immuno-oncology and dermatology.
