(NYSE:BRT) announced that an entity in which it has a 50% equity interest acquired Landings of Carrier Parkway, a 281-unit multi-family property located in Grand Prairie, Texas, midway between Dallas and Ft. Worth, for $30.8 million, including $19.0 million of mortgage debt obtained in connection with the acquisition. The mortgage debt matures in 2028, carries an interest rate of 4.37% and is interest only until 2023. BRT contributed $7.3 million of equity in connection with the acquisition and anticipated improvements to the property.\n“Landings of Carrier Parkway presents BRT with a unique opportunity to reposition a property located in a submarket undergoing strong economic growth,” stated Jeffrey A. Gould, President and CEO. “Grand Prairie is equidistant to both Dallas and Fort Worth, making it an attractive location to live; it is also well located near major employers, including Lockheed Martin, Textron and General Motors, which is projected to add new jobs to a near-by logistics center it is constructing. Landings is yet another example of investing in multi-family communities that we believe will contribute to BRT’s growth in the coming years.”\nBRT’s investment in Landings of Carrier Parkway represents the fourth investment with this equity partner. The prior investments are also located in Texas, which allows BRT and this partner to leverage local market knowledge in their efforts to reposition and add value to enhance the project’s economic potential. In fiscal 2018, the Company has acquired six multi-family properties for a total purchase price in excess of $230 million.\nForward Looking Statements:\nCertain information contained herein is forward looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
