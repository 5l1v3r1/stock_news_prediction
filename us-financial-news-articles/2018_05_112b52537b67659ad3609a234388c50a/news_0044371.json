It has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crime for years - charges that it denies.\nIn 2012, Italian authorities ruled that emissions from the plant had caused deaths, tumors and respiratory diseases. The state took full control in 2015 and about half Ilva’s annual 11 million-tonne capacity was eventually mothballed.\nArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, won European Union antitrust clearance to acquire Ilva this month, including two smaller sites in northern Italy, after promising to sell a string of businesses across Europe.\nArcelorMittal reached a 1.8-billion-euro ($2.1 billion) deal to buy Ilva last June, and plans to invest another 2.4 billion euros cleaning up and modernizing the plant, as well as cutting 5,500 jobs.\nThe steelmaker was seeking to close its purchase by the end of June, but unions have opposed the deal because they wanted the company to reduce planned layoffs by 2,000. ArcelorMittal was not immediately able to comment on Monday.\nEuropean steel prices have risen some 90 percent since hitting their lowest in more than a decade in December 2015, at the height of the global steel sector crisis.
