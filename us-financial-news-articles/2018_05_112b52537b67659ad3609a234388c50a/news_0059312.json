Writing that he had “sad news,” Bastianich explained that the restaurants would close on July 27.\nThe three restaurants are located in Las Vegas Sands (lvs) properties. Their shuttering is due to the corporation’s decision to cut ties with the Batali brand, notes Today . Batali and Bastianich Hospitality Group and Sands Corp. will both reportedly work to help the employees find new jobs.\nThe restaurants’ closures build on a growing backlash against Batali. The chef stepped down from daily operations of his restaurants back in December when four women accused him of inappropriate touching. However, in the months since, at least two women have accused Batali of sexual assault, a count Batali has denied.\nLast week, B&B Hospitality Group announced that it was “actively negotiating with Mr. Batali to buy his interests in the restaurants.” Eataly , the Italian marketplace chain, similarly announced that it was seeking to divest Batali of his “ small, minority interest ,” and has removed all Batali branded products from its stores.\nABC and the Food Network—two networks on which the chef frequently appeared—have also cut ties with Batali.\n", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.today.com/food/mario-batali-s-company-closing-las-vegas-restaurants-amid-investigation-t129878", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/28/mario-batali-sexual-misconduct-allegations-las-vegas-strip-restaurants-to-close", "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/21/celebrities/nypd-investigating-mario-batali/index.html"], "published": "2018-05-29T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T14:26:13.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
