(Nasdaq: NXST) announced today that its Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Company’s share repurchase authorization for up to an additional $200 million of repurchases of its Class A common stock. The expansion brings the total capacity under Nexstar’s share repurchase program to approximately $252.4 million when combined with the approximate $52.4 million remaining under its prior authorization as of December 31, 2017.\nPerry A. Sook, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nexstar Media Group, Inc. commented, “The expanded repurchase authorization reflects our confidence in the Company's growing free cash flow from operations and our commitment to allocating capital to repurchases, dividends, leverage reduction, select opportunistic accretive transactions and other purposes that can enhance shareholder value.\n“With the conclusion of the 2018 first quarter, Nexstar remains confident in meeting our target for average annual free cash flow of slightly in excess of $600 million for the 2018/2019 cycle, inclusive of our assumptions for a changing interest rate environment and our expectation that the Company will become nearly a full tax payer in 2018. We look forward to reporting our first quarter results on May 9 at which time we will provide an update on our recent deployment of our growing free cash flow.”\nAs of December 31, 2017, Nexstar had approximately 46.0 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding (the only class of shares outstanding).\nRepurchases by the Company will be subject to available liquidity, general market and economic conditions, alternate uses for the capital and other factors. Share repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, block trades or in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations and other legal requirements, including compliance with the Company’s finance agreements. There is no minimum number of shares that the Company is required to repurchase and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. All shares purchased will be held in the Company’s treasury for possible future use. The Company anticipates funding any share repurchases from its cash flow from operations.\nAbout Nexstar Media Group, Inc.\nNexstar Media Group is a leading diversified media company that leverages localism to bring new services and value to consumers and advertisers through its traditional media, digital and mobile media platforms.
