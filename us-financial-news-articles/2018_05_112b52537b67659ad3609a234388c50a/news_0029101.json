I want to stay here. I feel comfortable here and my family likes it here, so I definitely wanted to sign a new contract.\n“It’s a good thing to sign it before the World Cup, just to get everything out of the way and now I can concentrate on the last game and the World Cup.”\nGudmundsson becomes the sixth first-team player to sign a new deal at Burnley this season, joining Nick Pope, James Tarkowski, Ashley Barnes, Kevin Long and Stephen Ward.\nSean Dyche’s Burnley host 12th-placed Bournemouth in the final league game of the season on Sunday.
