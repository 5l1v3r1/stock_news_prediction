(OTCQB:VTLR) (CSE:VAI) (3V3:F), a premier cybersecurity managed services provider, has promoted Russ Armbrust to chief executive officer (CEO) and Andrew Douthwaite to the new position of chief technology officer (CTO).\nArmbrust previously served as vice president of sales, with Douthwaite serving as vice president of managed services. The company has made these appointments in light of its expanding customer base and the rapidly-growing interest in its managed service offerings.
