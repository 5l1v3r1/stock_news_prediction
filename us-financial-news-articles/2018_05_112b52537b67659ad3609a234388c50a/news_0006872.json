The Company expects to receive additional support from its stakeholders over the coming weeks as the Recapitalization Transaction process advances.\nThe Meetings and Voting and Early Consent Matters\nThe Meetings are scheduled to be held at the offices of Goodmans LLP at 333 Bay Street, Suite 3400, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2S7 on June 19, 2018.

Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders as at the Record Date will be entitled to vote on the CBCA Plan at the applicable Meeting based on one vote per US$1,000 of principal amount of Secured Debt or Unsecured Debt, respectively, held as at the Record Date. Shareholders as at the Record Date will be entitled to vote on the CBCA Plan at the Shareholders' Meeting based on one vote per common share held as at the Record Date.

(\"CHCL\"), will attend a hearing before the Court currently scheduled for June 26, 2018 or such other date as may be set by the Court, to seek Court approval of the CBCA Plan.\nCompletion of the Recapitalization Transaction will be subject to, among other things, approval of the CBCA Plan by the requisite majorities of the Secured Debtholders and the Unsecured Debtholders at the Meetings to be held on June 19, 2018, such other approvals as may be required by the Court or the TSX, other applicable regulatory approvals, approval of the CBCA Plan by the Court and the satisfaction or waiver of applicable conditions precedent. If all requisite approvals are obtained and the other conditions to completion of the Recapitalization Transaction are satisfied or waived, it is expected that the Recapitalization Transaction will be completed on or about the end of July 2018.

In order to be in the best position to advance the Recapitalization Transaction pursuant to insolvency proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (a \"Chapter 11 Process\"), if applicable, Concordia is soliciting votes in respect of the CBCA Plan contemporaneously with soliciting votes in respect of a Chapter 11 Process. Concordia intends to complete and implement the CBCA Plan pursuant to the CBCA Proceedings. Contemporaneous solicitation of votes in respect of a Chapter 11 Process ensures that the Company has the future ability to also complete the Recapitalization Transaction under such an alternative implementation process if the Company elects to do so in the future, subject to certain conditions and consent requirements as provided for in the Support Agreement. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Interim Order, a vote cast in favour of the CBCA Plan at the Meetings may also be counted in favour of implementing a plan of arrangement on substantially similar terms in any insolvency proceedings under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) that may be commenced by the Company, to the extent such proceedings are consented to by the Majority Private Placement Parties and the Majority Initial Consenting Debtholders (each as defined in the schedule to this news release).\nDisclosure of Certain Information Pursuant Confidentiality Agreements\nConcordia also announced today the disclosure of certain non-public information (the \"Disclosure Materials\") that has been provided to certain Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders that entered into confidentiality agreements (collectively, the \"Confidentiality Agreements\") with Concordia in connection with advancing the Recapitalization Transaction.

The projections do not purport to present the Company's financial condition in accordance with IFRS. The projections are unaudited and were prepared for internal use, capital budgeting and other management decisions and are subjective in many respects. The projections reflect numerous assumptions made by management of the Company with respect to financial condition, business and industry performance, general economic, market and financial conditions, and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict, and many of which are beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the projections will prove accurate. It is expected that there will be differences between actual and projected results, and the differences may be material, including due to the occurrence of unforeseen events occurring subsequent to the preparation of the projections. The inclusion of the projections herein should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or its representatives consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. Neither Concordia nor any of its affiliates or representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate outcome of the Company's efforts to realign its capital structure compared to the projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement or forward looking-information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAbout Concordia\nConcordia is an international specialty pharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of more than 200 patented and off-patent products, and sales in more than 90 countries.

In addition, the following is a summary of the significant assumptions underlying the FOFI contained herein and in the Disclosure Materials:\nprescription trends;\npricing for the Company's products;\nfuture market demand trends;\nmix of sales to government and non-government customers;\ngross profits for each product;\nforeign currency rates, including translation between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling;\ninventory levels;\noperating cost estimates;\nability to develop and market future product launches;\nanticipated timing of future product launches;\ncost to develop future products;\nanticipated timing to exit markets;\noperating cost synergies realized; and\nannual cost of current tax by jurisdiction.\nThe FOFI do not purport to present the Company's financial condition in accordance with IFRS, and there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the FOFI will prove accurate. It is expected that there will be differences between actual and forecasted results, and the differences may be material, including due to the occurrence of unforeseen events occurring subsequent to the preparation of the FOFI. The inclusion of the FOFI herein and in the Disclosure Materials should not be regarded as an indication that Concordia considers the FOFI to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the FOFI should not be relied upon as such.\nRisks and other factors related to FOFI include those risks and other factors referenced in this press release as well as in Concordia's filings with the Canadian Securities Regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, including (a) the factors described under the heading \"Forward-looking Statements\" in Concordia's Management's Discussion and Analysis dated March 8, 2018 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and (b) the factors described under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Concordia's Annual Report on Form 20-F dated March 8, 2018, both of which are available on SEDAR, online at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR, online at www.sec.gov .\nNotice regarding non-IFRS measures\nCertain financial data included in the Disclosure Materials, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit and Pre-Interest Free Cash Flow, are \"non-IFRS measures.\" These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute to the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. Management uses non-IFRS measures to provide supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures.\nNotice regarding forward-looking statements and information:\nThis press release and the Disclosure Materials include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws, regarding Concordia and its business, which may include, but are not limited to statements with respect to: the terms of the Recapitalization Transaction including, but not limited to, with respect to raising new equity capital, the exchange of Secured Debt for cash and New Secured Debt, the exchange of Unsecured Debt for new common shares, the aggregate consideration payable to Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders, and the percentage of the common shares outstanding to be retained by existing Shareholders;
