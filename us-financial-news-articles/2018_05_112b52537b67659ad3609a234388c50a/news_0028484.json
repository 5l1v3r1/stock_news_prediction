Published 17 Hours Ago Reuters Scott Barbour | Getty Images The AMP logo is seen on the AMP building on August 20, 2015 in Melbourne, Australia.\nTop Australian wealth manager AMP said it will defend two class action lawsuits filed against it following damaging revelations from a government-ordered inquiry into the country's financial industry.\nAMP confirmed that lawsuits have been filed by global law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Melbourne-based firm Phi Finney McDonald on behalf of some shareholders.\n\"AMP intends to vigorously defend the proceedings,\" the company said in a statement ahead of its annual general meeting later on Thursday, where angry shareholders are expected to challenge board re-appointments and executive pay.\nThree directors quit AMP on Tuesday following the departure of the company's chairman, chief executive and in-house lawyer, after revelations at the inquiry that the once-venerable firm had lied to regulators, allegedly doctored an independent report, and charged customers fees for no service.\nQuinn Emanuel said on Wednesday it had filed a class action on behalf of shareholders who have seen AMP's market capitalization plunge by around A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) following admissions made by AMP executives during the inquiry.\n\"The class action alleges that, amongst other things, AMP breached its continuous disclosure obligations and made misleading statements, causing shareholders significant loss,\" the firm said in a statement.\nLast month, Australian litigation financier IMF Bentham had said it would fund class action proceedings against AMP that would be conducted by Phi Finney McDonald.\nShares in AMP closed at A$4.08 on Wednesday, giving the firm a market value of A$11.91 billion.
