So daily, the team is working 777X with great focus, great intensity, but the development programme remains on track,” he said.\nEarlier this year, engine supplier General Electric emerged from a three-month delay in flight trials of its new GE9X jet engine, which was designed for the 777X.\nThe head of the 777X development programme told Reuters in March that Boeing had reorganised testing to avoid being delayed by those snags.\nHe also acknowledged problems in producing enough wing stringers - reinforcing strips that go outwards from the fuselage - for the 777X, and said Boeing was “tracking basically back to schedule” on this part of the project.
