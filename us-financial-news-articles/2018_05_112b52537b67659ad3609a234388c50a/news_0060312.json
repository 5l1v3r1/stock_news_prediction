She is very dangerous for me, very dangerous.\n“She is not as natural on the clay as someone like (Simona Halep) because she doesn’t like the sliding and slipping.\n“Maybe she doesn’t have the power to hit through the court if it’s damp and heavy but I think being a Grand Slam winner she will be looser on impact, more carefree.”\nThe Swede said winning his first Grand Slam at the French Open in 1982 opened the door to winning majors on surfaces away from his preferred clay.\nHe won the 1982 and 1983 Australian Opens when it was still held on grass and again in 1988 when it switched to hardcourts.\nWilander also won the U.S. Open on hardcourts and believes Wozniacki will now feel she can win on all the surfaces, be it on clay or Wimbledon’s slick lawns.\n“Once you’ve won a slam it just opens the door to winning more, at know time after my first one did I think I wasn’t going to win another one,” Wilander said.\n“I really think that now Caroline has one, she will think how come I’ve not won three or four? That will have entered her mind for sure.”\nWozniacki will face French wildcard Pauline Parmentier for a place in the last 16.
