In 15 percent of cases, the victim was under 16 - the youngest was just two.\nMore than a third of cases related to Pakistan and more than 10 percent to Bangladesh.\nThe biggest change was the rise in reports linked to Somalia, which had doubled since 2016. A fifth of cases overall concerned male victims.\nKarma Nirvana, a charity which campaigns against forced marriage, said it had seen a sharp increase in calls to its own helpline.\nCharity founder Jasvinder Sanghera said it was alarming that so many cases reported to the FMU involved children and called for schools to take action.\n“In Britain today there are children in our classrooms who are either engaged ... at risk of forced marriage or have been forced into marriage,” she said.\n“Families will use the summer holidays as an opportunity to take their kids abroad to enter into marriages or engagements - so what are we doing to ensure schools are engaged?”\nSanghera said she had recently met education chiefs to discuss the issue.\n“There is still an attitude out there that (schools) don’t see it as a safeguarding issue, but as a cultural issue. They don’t ... want to offend parents,” she added.\nForced marriage is illegal under British law, even if carried out abroad.\nThe unit could not immediately say if it had referred any cases to police.\n“The law is futile if we don’t use it,” Sanghera said. “Many people in Britain, and certainly the victims, don’t even know the law exists.”\nReporting by Emma Batha, Editing by Claire Cozens Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
