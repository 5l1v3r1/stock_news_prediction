REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration UK economic data have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks, causing traders to almost discount the possibility of an interest rate hike on Thursday.\nIn addition, worries about conflict within the British government over what its relationship with the European Union should look like after Brexit have hurt sterling.\nTraders will scrutinise Thursday’s decision for any indication of whether a rate hike is still likely this year.\nA narrow vote split among the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Mark Carney, could prepare markets for a hike in August.\nBut analysts said the BoE could find it challenging to explain its future approach to a market that has within a month cut its expectation of a May hike from 90 to around 10 percent.\n“The BoE’s hands are tied at tomorrow’s meeting and it will be a Herculean task to signal credibly to the market when it intends to implement the planned rate hike,” Antje Praefcke, a currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, wrote in a note to clients.\n“I cannot see much positive momentum for sterling in this whole situation,” she said.\nHowever, analysts at ING said in a note that the pound’s fall in recent weeks looked overcooked, and that they remained bullish for the medium-term.\nThe pound was down 0.2 percent on Wednesday at $1.3520, close to Tuesday’s lows — its weakest since Jan. 11.\nSterling is at risk of losing its status as one of the best performing G10 currencies this year, partly because investors have recently started betting on the dollar rising on the strength of higher interest rates.\nData released late last week showed investors had cut their net long positions in the pound over the past fortnight by the biggest amount since March 2017, although net long positions remain near a four-year high.\nTensions within Britain’s governing Conservative Party over how to agree terms of exit from the European Union have also re-emerged as a political risk for the pound.\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson described as “crazy” a proposed customs partnership that is believed to be Prime Minister Theresa May’s preferred option for relations with the EU after Britain leaves the bloc.\nAgainst the euro, sterling gained 0.1 percent to 87.510 pence as the stronger dollar pulled the single currency down across the board.\nReporting by Tom Finn; Editing by\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T13:41:24.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
