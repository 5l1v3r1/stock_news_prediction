(\"CES\" or the “ Company”) (TSX:CEU) (OTC – Nasdaq Intl:CESDF) is pleased to report on its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Further, CES announced today that it will pay a cash dividend of $0.0025 per common share on June 15, 2018 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2018.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (“Q1 2018”) of $300.3 million is the highest revenue quarter in the Company’s history exceeding the previous record quarter which was Q4 2017 with $278.8 million.\nThe record revenue and the other financial results reported herein for Q1 2018 are reflective of the improvement in commodity prices that has led to a rebound in activity in the oil and gas industry. While trough pricing levels continue to persist in CES’ business lines, the increase in industry activity and the continued growth of CES’ market share in certain business lines has allowed CES to sell higher volumes of its products across its rationalized cost structure. Consequently, the financial results of CES in Q1 2018 have generally improved in comparison to the results achieved in Q1 2017.\nAs noted above, CES generated record revenue in Q1 2018 of $300.3 million, compared to $252.4 million for Q1 2017, an increase of $47.9 million or 19%. EBITDAC for Q1 2018 was $41.4 million as compared to $36.1 million for Q1 2017, representing an increase of $5.3 million or 15%. Year-over-year, the Company’s operating results benefited from increased activity levels due to the improved commodity price environment. As detailed below, in Q1 2018 all facets of the business in the US and Canada have made positive contributions to revenue and EBITDAC.\nRevenue generated in the US for Q1 2018 was $179.5 million compared to $141.7 million for Q1 2017, an increase of $37.8 million or 27%. This year over year increase is reflective of the improved market conditions in Q1 2018 with significant activity improvement in the drilling fluids business, and increased US Treatment Points, particularly in the Permian Basin. Offsetting these gains for Q1 2018 was the negative impact of the devaluation of the US Dollar (“USD”) versus the Canadian Dollar in the current quarter on translation of the Company’s US source revenues, compared to Q1 2017.\nRevenue generated in Canada for Q1 2018 was $120.9 million compared to $110.7 million for Q1 2017, an increase of $10.2 million or 9%. PureChem contributed the majority of this gain as it continued to increase market share in Canada in the production chemicals business. Canadian Treatment Points for Q1 2018 have increased 21% from the comparative period. CES’ drilling fluids business in Canada faced challenges in Q1 2018, due to an early Spring break-up and decreased activity in the Deep Basin driven by lower gas prices. Despite these challenges, with the addition of HDD pipeline crossing revenue, revenues for CES’ drilling fluids business in Canada remained relatively flat when compared to Q1 2017.\nIn Q1 2018, CES recorded Cash Gross Margin of $79.9 million or 27% of revenue, compared to Cash Gross Margin of $69.3 million or 27% of revenue generated in Q1 2017. CES continues to benefit from operating leverage in our consumable chemicals business model, and the positive effects of the cost reduction initiatives taken in 2016. These gains were offset by cost inflation incurred in Q1 2018, which outpaced the Company’s ability to pass through its input costs to its customers for its products and services. As a result, Cash Gross Margin as a percentage of revenue in Q1 2018 remained flat from Q1 2017, and is slightly down sequentially from Q4 2017.\nCES’ balance sheet is well positioned to capitalize on the improving oilfield activity. In October 2017, CES successfully re-financed and reduced its coupon on its $300.0 million Senior Notes by issuing new 6.375% Senior Notes which have an extended maturity into October 2024. With respect to its Senior Facility, as at March 31, 2018, CES had a net draw of $116.3 million (December 31, 2017 – $109.3). The maximum available draw on the Senior Facility at March 31, 2018 was $165.0 million, comprised of a Canadian facility of $125.0 million and a US facility of USD$40.0 million. As at the date hereof, the Company has a net draw of approximately $115.0 million on its Senior Facility.\nIn 2018, it is expected that EBITDAC will materially exceed the sum of cash expenditures on interest, taxes, capital expenditures, and dividends. CES also announced today that it will pay a cash dividend of $0.0025 per common share on June 15, 2018 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2018.\nCES Q1 Results Conference Call Details\nWith respect to the first quarter results, CES will host a conference call / webcast at 10:00 am MT (12:00 am ET) on Friday, May 11, 2018.\nNorth American toll-free: 1-(800)-377-0758\nInternational / Toronto callers: (416)-340-2216\nLink to Webcast: http://www.cesenergysolutions.com/\nOutlook\nCES is very optimistic about its prospects for the rest of 2018 and beyond. CES’ record Q1 2018 revenue result reflects its effective execution in a dynamic environment and CES’ strategy has positioned it to take advantage of the opportunities ahead.\nCES believes that over time it can continue to grow its share of the oilfield consumable chemical markets in which it competes. CES also sees the consumable chemical market increasing its share of the oilfield spend as operators continue to: drill longer reach laterals and drill them faster; expand and optimize the utilization of pad drilling and cube development techniques; increase the intensity and size of their fracs; and then bring on to production high volume multi-well pads. After accounting for the additional challenges facing our Canadian customers, CES sees the US market and in particular the Permian Basin having the most near-term opportunities for growth. CES’ strategy is to utilize its decentralized management model; its vertically integrated manufacturing model; its problem solving through science approach; its patented and proprietary technologies; and its superior people and execution to increase market share. The downturn made many middlemen, or competitors who are simply resellers of other company’s products, redundant. By being basic in the manufacture of the consumable chemicals it sells, CES continues to be price competitive and a technology leader. Recent competitor consolidations and business failures will provide further opportunities for CES in this recovery period. CES believes that its unique value proposition makes it the premier independent provider of technically advanced consumable chemical solutions to the North American oilfield.\nCES will continue to assess M&A opportunities that will improve CES’ competitive position and enhance profitability. Any acquisitions must meet CES’ stringent financial and operational metrics. In its core businesses, CES will focus on growing market share, controlling costs, developing or acquiring new technologies, and making strategic investments as required to position the business to capitalize on the industry rebound and increasing intensity.\nBusiness of CES\nCES is a leading provider of technically advanced consumable chemical solutions throughout the life-cycle of the oilfield. This includes total solutions at the drill-bit, at the point of completion and stimulation, at the wellhead and pump-jack, and finally through to the pipeline and midstream market. At the drill-bit, CES’ designed drilling fluids encompass the functions of cleaning the hole, stabilizing the rock drilled, controlling subsurface pressures, enhancing drilling rates, and protecting potential production zones while conserving the environment in the surrounding surface and subsurface area. At the point of completion and stimulation, CES’ designed chemicals form a critical component of fracturing solutions or other forms of remedial well stimulation techniques. The shift to horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracturing with long horizontal well completions has been responsible for significant growth in the drilling fluids and completion and stimulation chemicals markets. At the wellhead and pump-jack, CES’ designed production and specialty chemicals provide down-hole solutions for production and gathering infrastructure to maximize production and reduce costs of equipment maintenance. Key solutions include corrosion inhibitors, demulsifiers, H 2 S scavengers, paraffin control products, surfactants, scale inhibitors, biocides and other specialty products. Further, specialty chemicals are used throughout the pipeline and midstream industry to aid in hydrocarbon movement and manage transportation and processing challenges including corrosion, wax build-up and H 2 S.\nCES operates in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (“WCSB”) and in several basins throughout the United States (“US”), with an emphasis on servicing the ongoing major resource plays. In Canada, CES operates under the trade names Canadian Energy Services, PureChem Services (“PureChem”), StimWrx Energy Services Ltd. (“StimWrx”), Sialco Materials Ltd. (“Sialco”), and Clear Environmental Solutions (“Clear”). In the US, CES operates under the trade names AES Drilling Fluids (“AES”), Superior Weighting Products (“Superior Weighting”), JACAM Chemicals (“JACAM”), and Catalyst Oilfield Services (“Catalyst”).\nThe Canadian Energy Services and AES brands are focused on the design and implementation of drilling fluids systems and completion solutions sold directly to oil and gas producers. The StimWrx brand provides near matrix stimulation and remediation of oil, gas, and injection wells in Western Canada. The Superior Weighting brand custom grinds minerals including barite, which is the weighting agent utilized in most drilling fluid systems. The JACAM, Catalyst, PureChem, and Sialco brands are vertically integrated manufacturers of advanced specialty chemicals. In addition to being basic in the manufacture of oilfield chemicals, JACAM, Catalyst, and PureChem have expanding distribution channels into the oilfield.\nClear is a complimentary business division that supports the operations and augments the product offerings in the WCSB. Clear is CES’ environmental division, providing environmental consulting, water management services, and drilling fluids waste disposal services primarily to oil and gas producers active in the WCSB.\nCES continues to invest in research and development of new technologies and in the top-end scientific talent that can develop and refine these technologies. CES operates eight separate lab facilities across North America: one in Sterling, Kansas; two in Houston, Texas; two in Midland, Texas; and one in each of Carlyle, Saskatchewan; Delta, British Columbia; and Calgary, Alberta. In the US, CES’ main chemical manufacturing and reacting facility is located in Sterling, Kansas with additional low-temperature reacting and chemical blending capabilities just outside of Midland, Texas and chemical blending capabilities in Sonora, Texas. In Canada, CES has a chemical manufacturing and reacting facility located in Delta, British Columbia with additional chemical blending capabilities located in Carlyle, Saskatchewan and Nisku, Alberta. CES also leverages third party partner relationships to drive innovation in the consumable fluids and chemicals business.\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, ($000’s, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Revenue 300,318 252,352 Gross margin 70,605 59,785 Cash Gross Margin (1) 79,942 69,278 Income before taxes 16,092 7,604 per share – basic 0.06 0.03 per share - diluted 0.06 0.03 Net income 13,250 7,778 per share – basic 0.05 0.03 per share - diluted 0.05 0.03 EBITDAC (1) 41,390 36,107 per share – basic 0.15 0.14 per share - diluted 0.15 0.13 Funds Flow From Operations (1) 34,084 27,523 per share – basic 0.13 0.10 per share - diluted 0.12 0.10 Dividends declared 2,010 1,983 per share 0.0075 0.0075 Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, Shares Outstanding 2018 2017 End of period 268,424,065 264,825,562 Weighted average - basic 268,178,300 264,169,358 - diluted 274,569,434 272,554,790\nAs at Financial Position ($000’s) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Net working capital 368,996 350,475 Total assets 1,184,941 1,140,667 Long-term financial liabilities (2) 422,205 414,384 Net Debt (1) 53,209 63,909 Shareholders’ equity 630,402 593,198 Notes:\n1 CES uses certain performance measures that are not recognizable under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
