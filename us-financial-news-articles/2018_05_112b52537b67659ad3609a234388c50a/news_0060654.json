REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\nGermany’s top administrative court ruled in February that Stuttgart, home to Daimler and Porsche ( VOWG_p.DE ), and Duesseldorf should consider such a ban.\nJens Kerstan, Hamburg’s Senator for the Environment said on Thursday that the bans will be maintained until the federal government gets automakers to install new emissions cleaning systems in older diesel cars, which the manufacturers oppose.\nMerkel’s Social Democrat coalition partners have repeatedly called for hardware fixes as a means to tackle diesel pollution but Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer of the Christian Social Union, the sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats opposes such action.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\n“It’s our goal and our responsibility to protect the citizens against harmful exhaust gases,” Kerstan, a member of the Green Party, said at a press briefing.\nThe German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) said hardware retrofits were complicated and needed years of development, suggesting that software refits made more sense.\n“Manufacturers are equipping millions of diesel cars with new engine software. This will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions 25 to 30 percent on average,” a VDA spokesman told Reuters.\nCritics expect the restrictions to shift toxic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to adjacent streets as drivers of older diesel cars find other routes, while policing the bans will be hard if the cars are not labeled in some way.\n“Many other streets in Hamburg with even higher pollution levels got excluded from the bans,” one environmental activist said on condition of anonymity, adding that politicians were only acting in order to avoid potential fines.\nGermany and five other European states face possible fines for violating air quality standards after the European Commission said this month it would take them to the region’s highest court over the matter.\nOf Hamburg’s 4,000 kilometer road network, only 2.2 kilometers are affected by the bans, Kerstan said.
