Baker , Anna Irrera 5 Min Read\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The windfall gains from the tax cuts passed by the U.S. Congress in December have brought back “animal spirits” that encourage risk-taking throughout corporate America, according to some of the participants at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California on Monday.

Not yet fully appreciated in terms of the intermediate impact they can have,” he said.\nU.S. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the Republican-majority in the House, said the tax cut bill has been a huge boost for Americans.\n“We’ve watched the growth of America expand. People are talking about 3.0 percent growth, we haven’t seen that in quite some time,” McCarthy said, adding that Americans have received pay raises and bonuses.

As result, the onus is on business leaders to re-train workers, he said.\nPeople “feel angry in part because the reason for their displacement and the lack of good job prospects isn’t the foreigner, the trade, the immigrant, it’s actually technology. And that is why re-skilling is so important”, he said.\nOne example of the uncertainty created for U.S. business by misplaced policies is President Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The exemptions from the tariffs for some countries expire on Tuesday, but it was still not clear on Monday which U.S. allies would get their exemptions renewed.\nThe uncertainty resulting from technological changes is also making it hard for chief executives to plan ahead, Vista’s Smith added.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n“It’s pretty reasonable to project a strategy for the next 12 months but frankly when you start talking about three to five years, it gets really murky really fast,” he said.\n“CEOs are expected to not only understand technologies that didn’t exist one or two years ago but to make strategic decisions as to which investments to make, and the pace of these changes have staggering consequences if you get it wrong,” he said.\n“The CEOs I talk to have never been more excited and never been more paranoid at the same time,” Smith said.\nAnother concern for businesses is rising U.S. interest rates.\nScott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, warned that Trump’s tax cuts could trigger more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. “We are coming in the United States to a point where the stimulus and fiscal policy put in place in Washington is colliding with monetary policy.”\nMinerd said: “Volatility is going to pick up.” Additional reporting by Lawrence Delevingne; Edited by Jennifer Ablan and Clive McKeef", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T00:43:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
