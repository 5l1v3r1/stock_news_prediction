But if there is one thing that the flag represents, it’s freedom, and that includes the freedom to descent [sic] when you want to take a stand against a social ill. Especially when that ill affects nearly 70% of its players as African-Americans.”\nAt the time of writing, the petition had amassed almost 8,000 signatures, against a goal of 10,000.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/UAnews/status/911626922274246656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://twitter.com/UnderArmour?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/526/827/882/"], "published": "2018-05-25T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T14:32:04.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
