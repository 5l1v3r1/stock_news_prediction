REUTERS/Lirio Da Fonseca This month’s election campaign has been marred by sporadic violence, though East Timor has been largely peaceful in recent years following recurrent bouts of political instability that it suffered after independence from Indonesia in 2002.\nThe 2017 parliamentary election produced no clear winner, with the Fretilin party of Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri winning just 0.2 per cent more votes than the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT), the party of independence hero Xanana Gusmao.\nEast Timor President Francisco “Lu Olo” Guterres dissolved parliament earlier this year and called for fresh elections, the fifth parliamentary election since independence from Indonesia in 2002.\nFormer president Gusmao cast his vote in the capital Dili as polls opened at 7am (2200 GMT).\n“I would say that (this election) will mean the end of this deadlock,” he told reporters.\n“We will only accept the result if we see that there are no irregularities, no electoral fraud,” he added.\nAsia’s youngest democracy has struggled to alleviate poverty, stamp out corruption and develop its rich oil and gas resources. The energy sector accounted for around 60 percent of GDP in 2014 and more than 90 percent of government revenue.\nCandidates in Saturday’s election have campaigned on promises to develop education and healthcare and boost the agriculture and tourism sectors.\nPolls close at 3pm local time and unofficial results are expected to come in by the early evening. Official results are likely to be announced next week.\nMore than 700,000 East Timorese are registered to vote in the country, which has a land area slightly smaller than Hawaii and is home to 1.2 million people.\nThe former Portuguese colony was invaded by neighboring Indonesia in 1975. An often violent 24-year resistance movement took East Timor to independence in 2002 and many of its key figures still feature prominently in running the country. Members of the military and police mutinied in 2006.\nWriting by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T06:55:56.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
