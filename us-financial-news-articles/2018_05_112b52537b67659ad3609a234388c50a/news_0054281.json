REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File Photo\nDuring a discussion in Cohen’s office, located on the skyscraper’s 26th floor eleven days before the inauguration, Cohen and Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg talked about improving relations between Moscow and Washington and arranged to meet again at the inauguration, the New York Times first reported. The paper quoted Andrew Intrater, an American who attended the meeting and manages investments for Vekselberg.\nThe source, who asked for anonymity as private conversations were being discussed, confirmed the New York Times’ account to Reuters by telephone.\nCohen and a lawyer for Intrater could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe paper reported that days after Trump’s inauguration as president in January 2017, Intrater’s private equity firm, Columbus Nova, gave Cohen a $1 million (£748,800) consulting contract, which was now under investigation by U.S. federal authorities.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is conducting an extensive investigation into alleged contacts and dealings between Trump, his associates and Russia, before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nFederal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan are, meanwhile, conducting a separate investigation into financial and business dealings by Cohen.\nIntrater told The New York Times that Vekselberg, his cousin and biggest client, did not instruct Columbus Nova to hire Cohen as a consultant.\nEarlier this year, Vekselberg himself was questioned by FBI agents working on Mueller’s inquiry, and was asked about Columbus Nova payments to Cohen as well as more than $300,000 in donations Intrater made to the Republican National Committee and Trump’s inauguration, CNN reported on Friday.
