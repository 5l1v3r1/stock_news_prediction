He declined to say which assets.\nSources said last month that Yildiz was in talks to restructure $6.5 billion of its $8.5 billion in debt.\nInvestors have been increasingly concerned about Turkish firms' ability to service foreign currency-denominated debt. Chronic weakness in the lira TRYTOM=D3 - the currency has lost some 13 percent against the dollar this year - has driven up the cost of debt repayment.\nYildiz also owns McVitieâ€™s biscuits and Istanbul-listed biscuit maker Ulker ( ULKER.IS ).\nReporting by Ceyda Caglayan; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by David Dolan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:24:00.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
