That helped to lift cash generation in its home market to nearly 33 percent.\nThe growth in patient days is expected to continue into the second half, Netcare said, but at a slower rate than in the first half.\nHalf-year group revenue rose 8.2 percent to 9.97 billion rand.\nNetcare also said that regulators approved its purchase of Akeso Clinics, a network of 12 dedicated mental healthcare facilities.\nReporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru Editing by David Goodman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
