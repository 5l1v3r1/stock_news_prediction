Middle market businesses, often defined as companies with between US$10m and US$1bn in annual revenues, are a driver of the US economy.\nSosland previously worked at PNC Capital Markets for almost 21 years.\nLast year Fifth Third hired David Pichler, a former co-head of credit fixed income at Cantor Fitzgerald, to lead credit sales for institutional fixed income.
