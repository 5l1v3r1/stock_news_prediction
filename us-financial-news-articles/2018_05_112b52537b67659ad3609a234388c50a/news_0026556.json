Yet they mark a turning point for women in the workplace, advocates say.\nThe Fawcett Society, which lobbies for gender equality, said last month that gender pay gap reporting was “a game changer in terms of workplace culture and practices”.\nBut it warned that enforcement was a “disproportionately drawn out process”, calling for measures to introduce swifter penalties for companies that failed to comply.\nReporting By Laura Creese, Editing by Claire Cozens.
