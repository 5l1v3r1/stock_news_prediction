J&T has been informed, prior to its decision, about the readiness to cover all liabilities of CEFC China by 2.00 pm tomorrow - the deadline set by J&T,” Tvrdik said on his Twitter account.\nSeparately, Czech financial group J&T Finance Group (JTFG), which says it is independent from JTPI but also a CEFC Europe creditor, said it was aware of the steps and believed it could shield CEFC Europe from the problems of its parent firm.\nIt said its unspecified receivables were well covered.\nJTPI said the crisis management at CEFC Europe included Dusan Palcr, a finacier who is also a board member at JTFG.\nChina-based parts of CEFC hold a 9.9 percent stake in JTFG but a plan to raise that to 50 percent was first rejected by the Czech National Bank and later abandoned.
