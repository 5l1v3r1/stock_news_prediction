He is the first Cubs player to have at least 40 RBIs before Memorial Day since Derrek Lee in 2005.\nBaez is tied for second in the majors in RBIs with Boston’s J.D. Martinez. Baltimore’s Manny Machado has 44.\nMac Williamson had two RBIs, and Gorkys Hernandez and Brandon Crawford had two hits apiece for the Giants, who scored three runs in the first inning off Tyler Chatwood but had only three hits in the final six innings off four relievers.\nRandy Rosario (1-0) gave up one hit in 2 1/3 scoreless innings for his first major league victory. He recalled after Yu Darvish was placed on the disabled list Saturday due to right triceps tendinitis.\nJason Heyward tripled, Tommy La Stella singled and Almora doubled in a two-run fifth that gave Chicago an 8-3 lead.\nAndrew McCutchen walked three times for the Giants, who left 13 on base while losing for the fourth time in five games.\nThe Giants scored three runs with two outs in the first inning, after a pair of walks and an infield single by Crawford loaded the bases. Pablo Sandoval drove in a run with an infield single, and Williamson followed with a two-run single to right for a 3-0 lead. Sandoval made his first career start at second base.\nThe Cubs tied it in their half of the first on five hits, including an RBI double by Kris Bryant and RBI singles by Anthony Rizzo and Addison Russell.\nThe Giants loaded the bases with two outs in the third to knock out Chatwood before Rosario got a groundout to end the inning. Chatwood gave up three runs on six hits and five walks in 2 2/3 innings. He was moved up a day in the rotation to make the start in place of Darvish.\nGiants left-hander Ty Blach (3-5) yielded seven hits and five runs in three-plus innings, with three strikeouts and four walks. He had won both of his previous career starts against the Cubs.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:18:22.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
