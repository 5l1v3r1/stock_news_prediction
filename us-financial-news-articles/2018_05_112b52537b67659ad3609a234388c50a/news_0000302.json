Rental revenue grew 6% over the prior year as a result of portfolio growth over the same period. Net operating income also grew by 3% to $11.08 million. AFFO was down 7% due to the timing and non-cash costs related to the Melcor Acquisition.\nAndrew Melton, President & CEO of Melcor REIT commented: \"It is my pleasure to report on the first quarter of 2018 as we celebrate our fifth anniversary. With our fourth vend-in from the Melcor Developments pipeline completed early in the quarter, we both grew and strengthened our portfolio, contributing to steady occupancy and growth in average rents in spite of continued challenges in some of our markets. We also continue to find creative ways to overcome challenging markets by adjusting for and capitalizing on market trends across all asset classes.\nWith a solid financial position, we remain well-positioned to continue to achieve steady results and to capitalize on growth opportunities.\"\nQ1-2018 Highlights:\nOur portfolio grew 6% in the first quarter through the closing of the Melcor Acquisition, the fourth acquisition under our right of first offer with Melcor. The Melcor Acquisition was comprised of 172,629 sf (owned GLA) of recently constructed, high-quality retail and industrial properties which improved both the mix and overall quality of our assets. Growth across key indicators was tempered by a decline in same-asset performance in the first quarter; particularly in our Edmonton office assets where market fundamentals remain challenging. Our proactive engagement on renewing existing tenants and pursuing new tenants resulted in a healthy retention rate of 67.1% at quarter end and overall occupancy of 90.5%. The stability and diversity of our portfolio with respect to both tenant profile and asset class enable the REIT to continue navigating through economic cycles. We are focused on the real estate fundamentals of asset enhancement and property management while conservatively managing our debt.\nHighlights of our performance in the first quarter include:\nRevenue growth of 6% and NOI growth of 3% over Q1-2017 as a result of the Melcor Acquisition completed on January 12, 2018, which added 172,629 sf to our owned portfolio. We secured key renewals on leases with three top revenue generating tenants (including one subsequent to the quarter) representing approximately 100,000 sf of GLA in the Edmonton area. We continued to execute on our proactive leasing strategy to both retain existing and attract new tenants. We completed new and renewed leasing representing 133,663 sf (including holdovers) for a retention rate of 67.1% at March 31, 2018. Same-asset NOI was down 5% over Q1-2017 and 2% from Q4-2017, trending with a decline in same-asset occupancy and weighted average base rents. The decline in our Northern Alberta office assets was partially offset by same-asset income and occupancy growth in retail and office assets in Southern Alberta, British Columbia and Regina. Net income (loss) in the current and comparative periods is significantly impacted by non-cash fair value losses on investment properties due to changes in capitalization rates/NOI and Class B LP Units due to changes in the REIT's unit price. Management believes adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) is a better reflection of our true operating performance. AFFO was $4.89 million or $0.18 per share, down 7% from Q1-2017 and stable over Q4-2017. The timing of the Melcor Acquisition resulted in a slight drag on AFFO in the first quarter. We sold two Edmonton area retail properties (including one subsequent to the quarter) for gross proceeds of $20.65 million as part of our capital recycling strategy. We issued 2,035,500 trust units to complete the Melcor Acquisition, increasing our public float by 18%. We paid distributions of $0.05625 per trust unit in January, February and March for a quarterly payout ratio of 96%. As at March 31, 2018 we have $1.26 million in cash and additional capacity under our revolving credit facility. We conservatively manage our debt, with a debt to GBV on the low end of our target range.\nFinancial Highlights Three months ended\nMarch 31 ($000s) 2018 2017 Δ % Non-Standard KPIs Net operating income (NOI) 11,075 10,737 3 % Funds from operations (FFO) 6,702 6,815 (2 )% Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) (5) 4,893 5,250 (7 )% Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (ACFO) 4,837 5,193 (7 )% Rental revenue 18,017 17,000 6 % Income before fair value adjustments 3,420 3,580 (4 )% Fair value adjustment on investment properties (6) (1 ) (16,459 ) nm Distributions to unitholders 2,225 1,882 18 % Cash flows from operations 3,697 2,827 31 % Same-asset NOI 9,766 10,333 (5 )% Per unit metrics Income (loss) - diluted $ 0.21 ($1.21 ) FFO $ 0.24 $0.26 AFFO (5) $ 0.18 $0.20 Distributions $ 0.17 $0.17 Payout ratio 96 % 83 %\n31-Mar-18 31-Dec-17 ﻿Δ﻿% Total assets ($000s) 723,854 676,237 7 % Equity ($000s) (1) 280,314 260,600 8 % Debt ($000s) (2) 396,680 353,340 12 % Weighted average interest rate on debt 3.69 % 3.75 % (2 %) Debt to GBV, excluding convertible debentures (maximum threshold - 60%) 48 % 47 % 2 % Finance costs coverage ratio (3) 2.66 2.93 (9 )% Debt service coverage ratio (4) 2.38 2.60 (8 )% Calculated as the sum of trust units and Class B LP Units at their book value.
