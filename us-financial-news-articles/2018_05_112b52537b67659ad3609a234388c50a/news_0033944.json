A man is seen in front of a Didi sign before a promotional event of its Hitch service for the Spring festival travel rush, in Beijing, China January 24, 2018. Picture taken January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer\nThe 21-year-old female passenger, a flight attendant, was killed this month while travelling from an airport hotel to the Eastern Chinese city Zhengzhou’s downtown area, allegedly by her driver who bypassed defective safety controls in the app.\nDidi said it will disable carpooling at night and make facial recognition checks compulsory for drivers.\nIt also proposed recording audio for every trip as an added security measure on its carpooling feature - “Didi Hitch” that has been temporarily suspended this week.\nThe ride-sharing firm has already apologised for the death of the passenger. Didi has said its facial recognition mechanism was defective and had failed to verify the driver who allegedly killed the passenger.\nThe male suspect had used a driver account that belonged to his father, contrary to Didi’s policy, the company has said.\nFollowing news of the death, users have criticised Didi’s efforts to market Hitch as a “social carpooling” service, which allowed drivers to create public tags for passengers including physical features, gender and age.\nOn Wednesday, Didi said profile pictures on the service will be replaced with generic images and that the service will only be available from 6 am to 10 pm.\nIt also said it would extend facial recognition requirements to its other services and redesign its emergency help function.\nDidi Chuxing - which is valued at $50 billion and counts SoftBank Group Corp as a major investor - is expanding heavily overseas, targeting new markets in Mexico, Brasil and Australia where it will come head-to-head with Uber.\nAfter acquiring Uber’s China business in 2016, Didi controls over 90 percent of the country’s ride-hailing market, giving users few alternative options, although new players have begun to edge their way into the market.
