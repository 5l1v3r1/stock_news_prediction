His rookie contract came with a $1 million signing bonus . It was around that time when he made one of his more \"'youthful' financial decisions,\" he tells Harrison Barnes in an interview with The Players' Tribune .\n\"I bought a $100,000 car when I was 20 years old,\" says Smith, now 49. That's the equivalent of about $200,000 in today's dollars .\n\"I wanted to treat myself to a convertible Mercedes Benz, the SL. It was burgundy,\" continues the eight-time Pro Bowler and three-time Super Bowl champion. \"Funny story, though. Before I actually bought the car, the car dealers treated me like I couldn't afford the car. I walked onto the lot and I was looking at brand new cars and the sales guy took one look at me — a young African American guy — and he walked me to the used car section.\n\"He said, 'Uh, let's try to get you into something that you can afford.'\" show chapters 11:38 AM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 | 00:52\n\"He didn't have a clue that I was on the Cowboys. So I looked at what he wanted me to look at, and then I said, 'No, I'll go with the SL. But I'm not gonna buy it from you.' And I went to another dealer and got it there.\"\nWhile Smith splurged big time as a rookie, he also recognized the importance of preparing for life after football at an early age.\n\"In my early 20s, I knew I wanted to do something after football, but I didn't know what it was. But as I got to my late 20s, things started to crystallize for me,\" says Smith, who has built a successful career as an entrepreneur since retiring from the NFL in 2004.\nAnd he picked up some valuable money advice during his years as a Cowboy. In fact, it was Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones who gave him the best advice he's ever received. \"He taught me about finances with a simple statement,\" Smith recalls in an interview with CNBC . \"He always said, 'Have a big front door and a small back door. Take in as much as you can, and spend as little as you can.'\" ", "external_links": ["https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/athletes/nfl/emmitt-smith-net-worth/", "https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/harrison-barnes-interview-with-emmitt-smith", "https://www.officialdata.org/1989-dollars-in-2018?amount=100000", "https://www.facebook.com/CNBCMakeIt/", "https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us"], "published": "2018-05-29T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:54:32.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
