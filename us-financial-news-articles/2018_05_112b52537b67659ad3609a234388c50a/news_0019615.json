Domestic demand remained resilient.\nAdding to the chipper mood was an announcement from the White House that China’s top economic official will visit Washington next week to resume trade talks with the Trump administration.\nBut there was little cheer for emerging market currencies, which had come out of a brutal week to suffer more falls against a stronger dollar\nSouth Africa’s rand and Russia’s rouble weakened 0.5 percent against the dollar. But it was once again Turkey’s lira that looked the most vulnerable, weakening 0.8 percent in its seventh straight day of losses.\n“We continue to see a pretty bad period,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, saying the dollar and higher U.S. yields were still taking their toll on emerging market currencies.\n“For a few months this year we saw the dollar fall and that was a strong driver...Now that the tide has turned things look different, and I don’t know when that is going to change.”\nEmerging market borrowing costs continued to rise, with average yield spreads of hard-currency bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries widening to 332 basis points - their highest level in 15 months.\nMarkets were also cautiously awaiting a decision from Trump on whether Washington would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, a move that could disrupt global oil supply.\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the deal, which eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, unless France, Germany and Britain - which also signed the deal, along with Russia and China - fix what he has called its flaws.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) (Reporting by Karin Strohecker; Editing by Angus MacSwan)\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-08T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T12:53:06.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
