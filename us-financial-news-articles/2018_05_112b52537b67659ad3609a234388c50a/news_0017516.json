Net income available to common shareholders was $23.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $48.0 million, or $0.75 per diluted common share, for the same quarter in 2017. Funds From Operations (FFO) (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the first quarter of 2018 was $61.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted common share, compared to $73.9 million, or $1.15 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2017. FFO as adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the first quarter of 2018 was $94.0 million, or $1.26 per diluted common share, compared to $76.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted common share, for the same quarter in 2017, representing a 6% increase in per share results.\n“In the first quarter, we delivered record revenues and have increased our earnings guidance for the year,” stated Company President and CEO Greg Silvers. “We are also effectively executing on our strategy of recycling capital to fund our investments. To that end, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we realized a very attractive yield from the Boyne mortgage repayment due to the upside consideration we included as part of the deal structure. We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation by recycling capital within our portfolio to pursue accretive investments.”\nA reconciliation of FFO to FFO as adjusted follows (unaudited, dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Amount FFO/share Amount FFO/share FFO available to common shareholders $ 61,024 $ 0.82 $ 73,894 $ 1.15 Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff 31,943 0.43 5 — Transaction costs 609 0.01 57 — Termination fee included in gain on sale — — 1,920 0.03 Deferred income tax expense 428 0.01 634 0.01 Impact of Series C and Series E dilution — (0.01 ) — — FFO as adjusted available to common shareholders $ 94,004 $ 1.26 $ 76,510 $ 1.19 Dividends declared per common share $ 1.08 $ 1.02 FFO as adjusted available to common shareholders payout ratio 86 % 86 % Portfolio Update\nThe Company's investment portfolio (excluding property under development) consisted of the following at March 31, 2018:\nThe Entertainment segment included investments in 149 megaplex theatre properties, seven entertainment retail centers (which include seven additional megaplex theatre properties) and 11 family entertainment centers. The Company’s portfolio of owned entertainment properties consisted of 13.2 million square feet and was 99% leased, including megaplex theatres that were 100% leased. The Recreation segment included investments in 25 ski areas, 20 attractions, 31 golf entertainment complexes and ten other recreation facilities. The Company’s portfolio of owned recreation properties was 100% leased. The Education segment included investments in 65 public charter schools, 67 early education centers and 14 private schools. The Company’s portfolio of owned education properties consisted of 4.7 million square feet and was 98% leased. The Other segment consisted primarily of the land under ground lease, property under development and land held for development related to the Resorts World Catskills casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York.\nThe combined owned portfolio consisted of 21.0 million square feet and was 99% leased. As of March 31, 2018, the Company also had a total of $249.9 million invested in property under development.\nInvestment Update\nThe Company's investment spending for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $108.6 million, and included investments in each of its primary operating segments:\nEntertainment investment spending during the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $25.5 million, including spending on build-to-suit development and redevelopment of megaplex theatres, entertainment retail centers and family entertainment centers, as well as a $7.5 million megaplex theatre acquisition. Recreation investment spending during the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $62.0 million, including investment spending on build-to-suit development of golf entertainment complexes and attractions, redevelopment of ski areas, a $7.8 million acquisition of a recreation facility and an investment of $10.3 million in a mortgage note secured by one other recreation facility. Education investment spending during the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $21.1 million, including spending on build-to-suit development and redevelopment of public charter schools, early education centers and private schools, as well as $8.4 million on two early education center acquisitions.\nOn February 16, 2018, a borrower exercised its put option to convert its mortgage note agreement, totaling $142.9 million and secured by 28 education facilities including both early education and private school properties, to a lease agreement. As a result, the Company recorded the rental property at the carrying value, which approximated fair value, of the mortgage note on the conversion date and allocated this cost on a relative fair value basis. The properties are leased pursuant to a triple-net master lease with a 23-year remaining term.\nCapital Recycling\nOn May 7, 2018, Boyne USA, Inc. (Boyne) purchased seven resort and attraction assets from Och-Ziff Real Estate (OZRE). These properties partially secure the Company’s mortgage note receivable due from OZRE with a carrying value of $249.2 million at March 31, 2018. Following the acquisition by Boyne, OZRE made a partial prepayment to the Company of approximately $175.4 million on this mortgage note receivable, leaving a carrying value of approximately $73.8 million that is secured by the remaining six ski properties. In connection with the partial prepayment of this note, the Company will recognize a prepayment fee totaling approximately $45.0 million during the second quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet Update\nThe Company had a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) of 5.80x at March 31, 2018. This ratio was outside of the Company's targeted range of 4.6x to 5.6x for this measure, however, the Company has reduced its net debt subsequent to March 31, 2018 in conjunction with the OZRE partial prepayment described above and anticipates additional dispositions over the remainder of 2018. These dispositions are expected to have the impact of reducing this ratio.\nThe Company had $24.5 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $570.0 million outstanding under its $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at March 31, 2018.\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due July 15, 2020. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to the principal amount of $250.0 million plus a premium calculated pursuant to the terms of the indenture of $28.6 million, together with accrued and unpaid interest of $2.3 million. In connection with the redemption, the Company recorded a non-cash write off of $3.3 million in deferred financing costs. Additionally, the Company prepaid in full a mortgage note payable totaling $11.7 million with an annual interest rate of 6.19%, which was secured by one theatre property. Subsequent to these transactions, the Company has no debt maturities until 2022.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company issued $400.0 million in senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2028. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.95%. The Company used the net proceeds from the note offering to pay down its unsecured revolving credit facility.\nDividend Information\nThe Company declared regular monthly cash dividends during the first quarter of 2018 totaling $1.08 per common share. This dividend represents an annualized dividend of $4.32 per common share, an increase of almost 6% over the prior year, and would be the Company's eighth consecutive year with a significant annual dividend increase.\nThe Company also declared first quarter cash dividends of $0.359375 per share on its 5.75% Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares, $0.5625 per share on its 9.00% Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares and $0.359375 per share on its 5.75% Series G cumulative redeemable preferred shares.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company is increasing its 2018 guidance for FFO as adjusted per diluted share to a range of $5.75 to $5.90 from a range of $5.23 to $5.38. In addition, the Company is confirming its 2018 investment spending guidance of a range of $400.0 million to $700.0 million and its 2018 disposition proceeds guidance of a range of $350.0 million to $450.0 million.\nFFO as adjusted guidance for 2018 is based on FFO per diluted share of $5.17 to $5.27 adjusted for estimated costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff, transaction costs, termination fees related to public charter schools and deferred income tax expense. FFO per diluted share is based on a net income per diluted share range of $3.44 to $3.59 less estimated gain on sale of real estate of a range of $0.24 to $0.29 and the impact of Series C and Series E dilution of $0.08, plus estimated real estate depreciation of $2.05 per diluted share (in accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO).\nQuarterly Supplemental\nThe Company's supplemental information package for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 is available on the Company's website at http://investors.eprkc.com/earnings-supplementals .\nEPR Properties\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Rental revenue $ 128,933 $ 107,037 Tenant reimbursements 3,991 3,749 Other income 630 692 Mortgage and other financing income 21,414 17,634 Total revenue 154,968 129,112 Property operating expense 7,564 6,350 General and administrative expense 12,324 11,057 Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff 31,943 5 Interest expense, net 34,337 30,692 Transaction costs 609 57 Depreciation and amortization 37,684 28,077 Income before equity in income from joint ventures and other items 30,507 52,874 Equity in income (loss) from joint ventures 51 (8 ) Gain on sale of real estate — 2,004 Income before income taxes 30,558 54,870 Income tax expense (1,020 ) (954 ) Net income 29,538 53,916 Preferred dividend requirements (6,036 ) (5,952 ) Net income available to common shareholders of EPR Properties $ 23,502 $ 47,964 Per share data attributable to EPR Properties common shareholders: Basic earnings per share data: Net income available to common shareholders $ 0.32 $ 0.75 Diluted earnings per share data: Net income available to common shareholders $ 0.32 $ 0.75 Shares used for computation (in thousands): Basic 74,146 64,033 Diluted 74,180 64,102 EPR Properties\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets Rental properties, net of accumulated depreciation of $776,404 and $741,334 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively $ 4,815,137 $ 4,604,231 Land held for development 33,693 33,692 Property under development 249,931 257,629 Mortgage notes and related accrued interest receivable 819,837 970,749 Investment in direct financing leases, net 58,101 57,903 Investment in joint ventures 5,538 5,602 Cash and cash equivalents 24,514 41,917 Restricted cash 15,640 17,069 Accounts receivable, net 88,750 93,693 Other assets 127,725 109,008 Total assets $ 6,238,866 $ 6,191,493 Liabilities and Equity Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 117,583 $ 136,929 Dividends payable 32,791 30,185 Unearned rents and interest 81,461 68,227 Debt 3,131,437 3,028,827 Total liabilities 3,363,272 3,264,168 Total equity $ 2,875,594 $ 2,927,325 Total liabilities and equity $ 6,238,866 $ 6,191,493 EPR Properties\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 FFO: (A) Net income available to common shareholders of EPR Properties $ 23,502 $ 47,964 Gain on sale of real estate — (2,004 ) Real estate depreciation and amortization 37,464 27,880 Allocated share of joint venture depreciation 58 54 FFO available to common shareholders of EPR Properties $ 61,024 $ 73,894 FFO available to common shareholders of EPR Properties $ 61,024 $ 73,894 Add: Preferred dividends for Series C preferred shares — 1,941 Diluted FFO available to common shareholders of EPR Properties $ 61,024 $ 75,835 FFO per common share: Basic $ 0.82 $ 1.15 Diluted 0.82 1.15 Shares used for computation (in thousands): Basic 74,146 64,033 Diluted 74,180 64,102 Weighted average shares outstanding-diluted EPS 74,180 64,102 Effect of dilutive Series C preferred shares — 2,053 Adjusted weighted average shares outstanding-diluted 74,180 66,155 Other financial information: Straight-lined rental revenue $ 1,874 $ 5,051 Dividends per common share $ 1.08 $ 1.02 (A)\nNAREIT developed FFO as a relative non-GAAP financial measure of performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP and management provides FFO herein because it believes this information is useful to investors in this regard. FFO is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share. Pursuant to the definition of FFO by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, the Company calculates FFO as net income available to common shareholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other affiliates. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other affiliates are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company has calculated FFO for all periods presented in accordance with this definition. In addition to FFO, the Company presents FFO as adjusted. Management believes it is useful to provide FFO as adjusted as a supplemental measure to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share. FFO as adjusted is FFO plus costs (gain) associated with loan refinancing or payoff, transaction costs, retirement severance expense, preferred share redemption costs, termination fees associated with tenants' exercises of education properties buy-out options, impairment of direct financing lease (allowance for lease loss portion) and provision for loan losses, and by subtracting gain on early extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on sale of land, gain on insurance recovery and deferred tax benefit (expense). FFO and FFO as adjusted are non-GAAP financial measures. FFO and FFO as adjusted do not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP and are not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs and are not to be considered an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measure as a measurement of the results of the Company's operations, cash flows or liquidity as defined by GAAP. It should also be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO or FFO as adjusted the same way so comparisons of each of these non-GAAP measures with other REITs may not be meaningful.\nThe conversion of the 5.75% Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares and the 9.00% Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares would be dilutive to FFOAA per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Therefore, the additional 2.1 million and 1.6 million common shares that would result from the conversion and the corresponding add-back of the preferred dividends declared on those shares are included in the calculation of diluted FFOAA per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The effect of the conversion of the 5.75% Series C convertible preferred shares and the 9.00% Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares do not result in more dilution to per share results and are therefore not included in the calculation of diluted FFO per share data for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe conversion of 5.75% Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares would be dilutive to FFO and FFOAA per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Therefore, the additional 2.1 million common shares that would result from the conversion and the corresponding add-back of the preferred dividends declared on those shares are included in the calculation of diluted FFO and diluted FFOAA per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The effect of the conversion of our 9.0% Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares and the additional 1.6 million common shares that would result from the conversion do not result in more dilution to per share results and are therefore not included in the calculation of diluted FFO and FFOAA per share data for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is a supplemental measure derived from non-GAAP financial measures the Company uses to evaluate its capital structure and the magnitude of its debt against its operating performance. The Company believes that investors commonly use versions of this ratio in a similar manner. In addition, financial institutions use versions of this ratio in connection with debt agreements to set pricing and covenant limitations. The Company's method of calculating Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Reconciliations of debt and net income (both reported in accordance with GAAP) to Net Debt, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) are included in the following tables (unaudited, in thousands):\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net Debt: (B) Debt $ 3,131,437 $ 2,616,382 Deferred financing costs, net 28,558 28,231 Cash and cash equivalents (24,514 ) (14,446 ) Net Debt $ 3,135,481 $ 2,630,167 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 29,538 $ 53,916 Interest expense, net 34,337 30,692 Income tax expense 1,020 954 Depreciation and amortization 37,684 28,077 Gain on sale of real estate — (2,004 ) Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff 31,943 5 Equity in (income) loss from joint ventures (51 ) 8 EBITDAre (for the quarter) (C) $ 134,471 $ 111,648 Transaction costs 609 57 Adjusted EBITDA (for the quarter) $ 135,080 $ 111,705 Adjusted EBITDA (1) (D) $ 540,320 $ 446,820 Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 5.80 5.89 (1) Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is multiplied by four to calculate an annual amount. (B)\nNet Debt represents debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) adjusted to exclude deferred financing costs, net and reduced for cash and cash equivalents. By excluding deferred financing costs, net and reducing debt for cash and cash equivalents on hand, the result provides an estimate of the contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid, net of cash available to repay it. The Company believes this calculation constitutes a beneficial supplemental non-GAAP financial disclosure to investors in understanding our financial condition. The Company's method of calculating Net Debt may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\n(C)\nNAREIT developed EBITDAre as a relative non-GAAP financial measure of REITs, independent of a company's capital structure, to provide a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company. Pursuant to the definition of EBITDAre by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, the Company calculates EBITDAre as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding interest expense (net), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, impairment losses of depreciable real estate, costs (gain) associated with loan refinancing or payoff and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other affiliates.\nManagement provides EBITDAre herein because it believes this information is useful to investors as a supplemental performance measure as it can help facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs. EBITDAre does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs and is not to be considered an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measure as a measurement of the results of the Company's operations or cash flows or liquidity as defined by GAAP. (D)\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA in its analysis of the performance of the business and operations of the Company. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it excludes various items that management believes are not indicative of operating performance, and that it is an informative measure to use in computing various financial ratios to evaluate the Company. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDAre (defined above) excluding gain on insurance recovery, retirement severance expense, the provision for loan losses and transaction costs, and which is then multiplied by four to get an annual amount.\nThe Company's method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance under GAAP, does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs, including distributions. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
