Rockies closer Wade Davis struck out Crawford looking on a full count to open the inning, prompting the ejection of the San Francisco shortstop and Giants manager Bruce Bochy for arguing that the pitch was low.\nCrawford says he was irritated that an earlier pitch in nearly the same location but higher had been called a ball.\n“The biggest thing is he called ball one down and [catcher Chris] Iannetta talked to him and said he didn’t agree with it, and then the ball that was even lower than the one you called a ball, you call a strike to end my at-bat,” Crawford said, per NBC Sports Bay Area. “That’s the biggest thing I have issue with. If you call the first pitch a strike, then I know I’ve got to protect there.”\nCrawford, who thought he had drawn a walk, dropped his bat and briefly turned toward first before confronting umpire Chris Segal. He says Segal twice told him to pick up his bat.

That’s a first for me,” said Crawford, who had only been ejected once before. “I feel like we have somebody in the dugout who it’s literally their job to pick up the bat.”\nOn Wednesday, first baseman Brandon Belt argued a game-ending called third strike against the Cincinnati Reds.\n“It’s frustrating. It’s two games in a row,” Bochy vented. “Guys are doing a great job of laying off pitches and they’re balls. It’s frustrating. Now we’ve got the leadoff runner on. It’s frustrating. Those are balls. You’re competitive and you’re trying to come back and the call went their way.”\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T22:07:16.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
