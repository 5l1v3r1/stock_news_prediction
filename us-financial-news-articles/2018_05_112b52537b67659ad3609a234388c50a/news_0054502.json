However for many companies it was a huge wakeup call because they never did their homework. They never took the data protection directive seriously,” said Patrick Van Eecke, partner at law firm DLA Piper.\nActivists are already planning to use the right to access their data to turn the tables on internet platforms whose model relies on processing people’s personal information.

The International Association of Privacy Professionals found that only 40 percent of companies affected by the GDPR expected to be fully compliant by May 25. DATA PORTABILITY\nIt is unclear how many provisions of GDPR will be interpreted and enforced. European regulatory authorities, many of whom say they are under-funded, will oversee the new law, with a central body to resolve conflicts.\nOne key provision of GDPR, the right to data portability, is causing particular confusion.\n“I think the data portability rights are pretty significant and are going to take a while for people to figure out what the bounds of them are and how to go about complying with them,” said David Hoffman, associate general counsel and global privacy officer at Intel.\nFor example, music streaming services such as Spotify create playlists for users based on their music preferences. While a user seeking to exercise the data portability right would be able to move playlists he or she created, the situation becomes fuzzy if the playlists are created by the streaming service using algorithms.\nEU data protection authorities said individuals should be able to transfer data provided by them but not “derived data” created by the service provider such as algorithmic results.\n“It’s not obvious that you can necessarily migrate the data from your system to somebody else’s system,” Tanguy Van Overstraeten, of Linklaters, said.\nOn the business side, companies are rushing to renegotiate contracts with suppliers and service providers because GDPR increases their liability if something goes wrong.\nData processors which only process or store the data on behalf of their clients, for example cloud computing providers, will be directly liable for sanctions and could face lawsuits from individuals, and that needs to be reflected in contracts.\n($1 = 0.8519 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T09:13:27.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
