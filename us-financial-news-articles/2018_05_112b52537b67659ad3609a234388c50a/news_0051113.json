The group previously agreed to curb their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day to boost oil prices and clear a supply glut.\n\"Any signs that the group may be heading towards an early exit from the production cut agreement would weigh on prices,\" ANZ bank said in a note.\nA surprise increase in U.S. weekly crude stockpiles also kept a lid on oil prices. Commercial U.S. crude inventories rose <C-STK-T-EIA> by 5.8 million barrels in the week to May 18, beating analyst expectations for a decrease of 1.6 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, Libya, which is an OPEC member, cut its oil production by about 120,000 barrels per day as unusually hot weather prompted power problems, an official from the National Oil Corp said on Wednesday.
