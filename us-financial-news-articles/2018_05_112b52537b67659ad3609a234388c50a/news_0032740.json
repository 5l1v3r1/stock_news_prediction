MORE CHARGES\nCYBG’s loss stemmed from a previously announced 350 million pound charge for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI), which Chief Executive officer David Duffy described as disappointing.\nCYBG reported the PPI hit in March after a media campaign by Britain’s financial watchdog boosted claims by customers against banks for Britain’s costliest-ever consumer scandal, in which people were mis-sold often worthless insurance products.\nDuffy said that the “strong capital position” of the group meant that CYBG could absorb this hit without changing its future strategy or aspirations, but analysts warned the bank’s rate of customer claims could see it need to take yet more charges for compensation.\nThe bank reported a Tier I capital ratio of 11.3 percent, below the 12-13 percent range that it aspires to. Analysts expect the bank will draw on capital to fund some of its bid for Virgin Money, with CYBG expected to benefit from a capital windfall due to an expected change to risk models.\nCYBG has until June 4 to either make a firm offer or walk away from its bid for Virgin Money, a move that sparked wider talk of consolidation among British mid-sized lenders when it was announced.
