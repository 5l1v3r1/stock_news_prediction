Production elsewhere outside OPEC was flat to lower, the IEA said, noting declines in the North Sea and Brazil.\nThe IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, expects non-OPEC supply to rise by 1.87 million bpd in 2018, up from a previous forecast of 1.8 million bpd.\n(Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:29:03.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
