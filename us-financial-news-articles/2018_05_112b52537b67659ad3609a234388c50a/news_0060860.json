A lawyer for Jones could not immediately be reached for comment.\nJones pleaded guilty in September, admitting that he carried an AK-47 automatic assault rifle for al Shabaab, which is allied with al Qaeda.\nAl Shabaab, which seeks to overthrow Somaliaâ€™s Western-backed government and impose a strict version of sharia, or Islamic law, has carried out violent attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.\nJones was charged in January 2016. Prosecutors said at the time that Jones, who was born and lived in Maryland, traveled in 2011 to Kenya and then to Somalia, where he was brought to an al Shabaab training camp.\nAuthorities said Jones trained with the group for three months, reading and interpreting the Koran and learning how to handle weapons, including an AK-47 and rocket-propelled grenades.\nHe then became a member of a specialized fighting force within al Shabaab known as Jaysh Ayman that carried out attacks and raids across the border in Kenya and participated in a battle against Kenyan soldiers in the Somali town of Afmadow, prosecutors said.\nJones was taken into custody by Somali authorities on Dec. 7, 2015, while he was attempting to procure a boat to depart for Yemen, according to prosecutors.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T03:28:30.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
