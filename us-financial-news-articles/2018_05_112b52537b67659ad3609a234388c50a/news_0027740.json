The property is 84% occupied. The purchase price of approximately €11 million ($17 million) represents a going-in cap rate of 6.2% with upside potential from leasing. In addition, the Trust is currently in exclusive negotiations for 3 properties in Germany and the Netherlands with a combined purchase price of over €50 million.\nDispositions ― Four properties, including two German and two Dutch properties, were sold for an aggregate sales price of $14.2 million (€9.1 million) in Q1 2018.
