Major state producers are increasingly using the two exchanges to set prices for their supply contracts.\nIn April, China National Offshore Oil Corp sold liquefied natural gas cargoes on the Shanghai exchange for delivery during the winter.\n$1=6.3667 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Meng Meng and Aizhu Chen; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:25:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
