Earnings per common share totaled $0.08 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.00 effectively, in the prior quarter and $0.04 in the same quarter a year ago. The improvement in net income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter a year ago reflects a $732 thousand or 32.3 percent increase in net interest income offset by a $341 thousand or 16.8 percent increase in non interest expenses. Neither quarter included gains or losses on the sale of SBA loans.\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $332 million, an increase of $36.8 million, a 12.4 percent increase, from the prior quarter, and an increase of $58.2 million, or 21.2 percent, from a year ago. Average earning assets for the quarter reached $301 million, an increase of $16.9 million, or 5.9 percent, compared with the prior quarter, and an increase of $51.4 million, or 20.5 percent, from the same quarter a year ago.\nDeposits totaled $283 million at March 31, 2018 and were up $26.2 million, or 10.2 percent, from the prior quarter, up $47.8 million, or 20.3 percent, from a year ago. Deposit growth from the prior quarter was concentrated in interest bearing demand and money market accounts, as depositors become more sensitive to the interest rate environment, while deposit growth from the same quarter a year ago featured a 22.8 percent increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits.\nLoans totaled $261 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $22.2 million, or 9.3 percent, from the prior quarter, an increase of $62.6 million, or 31.6 percent, compared to the same quarter a year ago. 63.8 percent of the loan growth over the last twelve months has been in categories other than commercial real estate and construction.\nNon-performing assets increased $295 thousand to $1.7 million in the first quarter and now represents 0.65 percent of total loans. The allowance for loan losses represents 1.34 percent of total loans at quarter end.\nNet interest margin for the first quarter totaled 4.03 percent compared with 3.94 percent for the prior quarter and 3.67 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Improvement from the prior quarter primarily relates to growth in average loan balances and yields on excess funds, while improvement from the same quarter a year ago is primarily due to the increase in earning assets.\nTotal equity as of March 31, 2018 of $38.2 million increased $477 thousand, or 1.3 percent, from the prior quarter. The Bank’s capital levels are well above FDIC “Well Capitalized” standards as of March 31, 2018, with a total capital ratio of 15.49 percent, a tier 1 capital ratio of 14.24 percent, and a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 12.72 percent. Total equity includes $4.1 million of Preferred Stock that the Bank expects to redeem in the coming year. If Preferred Stock were to have been redeemed at quarter end the total capital ratio would have been approximately 13.97 percent.\nBook value per common share totaled $5.14 as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 1.6 percent from the same quarter one year ago.\n“The Bank’s growth is a direct reflection of the economic strength of all our local markets and our clients’ preference to work with a local relationship oriented financial partner. While 'the numbers' are certainly important, our relationships are built on more than numbers and we are gratified to have been named Best Local Bank by the readers of the East Bay Times for the second year in a row,” said William S. Keller, President, and Chief Executive Officer. “We want to thank our clients and investors who support us, and assure them that we will continue to work hard to make our Bank the best it can be. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we enter the second quarter with loans outstanding of over $12 million greater than the first quarter average, and the May 2018 conversion of our San Mateo office to a full service branch, the roll out of new and improved online banking products, and new marketing materials that highlight many of our clients’ wonderful success stories.”\nAbout Community Bank of the Bay\nCommunity Bank of the Bay (OTCBB:CBYAA) serves the financial needs of closely held businesses and professional service firms, as well as their owner-operators and non-profit organizations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.
