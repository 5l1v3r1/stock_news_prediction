Traders work at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3 percent by 0736 GMT, hovering near its highest level in over 3 months, while the FTSE 100 .FTSE hit a new record high, as strength in the dollar supported the internationally exposed index.\nWhile activity was reduced by the closure of some markets including Germany for Whit Monday, Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB fell 1.7 percent, weighed down by a number of stocks going ex-dividend including banking heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ).\nFTSE MIB futures IFSc1 however still underperformed, down 0.1 percent as worries over the creation of a eurosceptic government pushed Italian government bond yields higher.\nRyanair ( RYA.I ) fell as much as 3.1 percent at the open. The Irish airline posted a record annual profit as it brushed off a rostering mess-up that forced it to cancel flights and sparked a dispute with pilots, but warned profits would fall back in the coming year due to higher costs and no fare growth.\nIts shares pared losses and were last down 0.2 percent.
