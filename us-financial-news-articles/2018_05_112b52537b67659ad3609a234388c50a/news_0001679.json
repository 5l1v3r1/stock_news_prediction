[but] industrials had a real nice bounce. A stock like Boeing, which has been really dragging lately, found a nice bid this morning.\"\nBoeing — which has struggled for gains since reporting earnings last week — carried the Dow higher, with the aircraft manufacturer rallying more than 2 percent. Shares of fellow industrial company 3M gained 0.8 percent.\nThe afternoon rally came after a sharp fall in equities earlier in the session, as a batch of better-than-expected earnings failed to push the major averages higher while trade and geopolitical worries mounted.\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York.

I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future.\"\nTweet\n\"Trump's 'level playing field' implies a harder line and general sentiment around the talks is going to be volatile,\" said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. \"Chances of a grand bargain are virtually nil but the market does want a de-escalation of trade tensions.\"\nMeanwhile, Iran Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the country will not renegotiate the nuclear deal it struck with the U.S. in 2015.
