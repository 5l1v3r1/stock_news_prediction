It had no information on casualties.\nPentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner, when asked about reports of the attack, said the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria did not carry it out and the coalition does not target Syrian government positions.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut; Additional reporting by Dan Wiliams in Jerusalem and Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:24:50.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
