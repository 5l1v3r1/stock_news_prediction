We also plan to file an IND for CTX101 in CD19+ malignancies by the end of 2018. In parallel, we are focused on growing and scaling our organization for success with key hires across all functions.”\nRecent Highlights and Outlook\nRemains on track for CTX001 in β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). After announcing the acceptance of the first Clinical Trial Application (CTA), CRISPR, together with its partner, Vertex, remains on track to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of CTX001 in patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia in the second half of 2018. In addition, the Company remains on track to begin clinical studies for CTX001 in SCD in 2018. CTX001 is an autologous gene-edited hematopoietic stem cell therapy for patients suffering from severe hemoglobinopathies.\nContinuing to advance wholly-owned allogeneic CRISPR-based CAR-T cell therapies. CRISPR remains on track to file an IND for CTX101, its lead allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy targeted toward CD19+ malignancies, by year-end 2018. At the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting held in April 2018, CRISPR presented data demonstrating the generation of CAR-T cells targeted toward BCMA and CD70 through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing that have high editing rates, consistent expression, and selective and potent cell killing. Continued recruitment of top senior leadership. As CRISPR advances toward the clinic, the Company continues to recruit top talent across all functions. Earlier in 2018, CRISPR announced the hiring of Steve Caffé, M.D., as the Head of Regulatory of Affairs and Shelby Walker as the Head of Intellectual Property. The company has continued to expand its capabilities in all departments including Research, Clinical, Manufacturing, and other functions. Completed successful follow-on offering. In January 2018, CRISPR announced the completion of a follow-on offering, including full exercise of the overallotment, totaling 5,750,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $22.75 for net proceeds of $122.6 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash Position: Cash as of March 31, 2018 was $341.8 million, compared to $239.8 million as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $102.0 million. The increase in cash was primarily driven by the January 2018 follow-on offering.\nRevenues: Total collaboration revenues were $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. CRISPR’s collaboration revenue is primarily attributable to revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement with Vertex for work outside hemoglobinopathies. Cost sharing on the Vertex co-development and co-promotion agreement related to hemoglobinopathies is not included in revenue, but instead as an offset to expense in R&D.\nR&D Expenses: R&D expenses were $19.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $14.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in expense was driven by the advancement of our hemoglobinopathies program, the broadening of our wholly owned immuno-oncology portfolio, as well as increased investment in our CRISPR/Cas9 platform research.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net Loss: Net loss was $28.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to a loss of $21.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, driven predominantly by increased R&D expense in the quarter.\nAbout CRISPR Therapeutics\nCRISPR Therapeutics is a leading gene editing company focused on developing transformative gene-based medicines for serious diseases using its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 platform.
