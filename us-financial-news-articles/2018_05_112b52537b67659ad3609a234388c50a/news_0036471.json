That follows the hiring late last year of Trevor Hendricks , a design engineer from HP, and John Hubbard , a longtime FPGA designer who previously worked at Portland-based Tektronix.\nIn an interview last week with CNBC's Jon Fortt , AWS CEO Andy Jassy referenced the significance of the company's 2015 acquisition of Israeli chipmaker Annapurna Labs in discussing Amazon's expansion into semiconductors.\nWe \"bought a chip company in Israel a few years ago, so we've been designing our own chips for a while,\" Jassy said. \"You can expect us to continue to do so.\" show chapters 7:53 PM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 | 16:54\nVideo processing is a common use of FPGAs and is listed as an application on AWS's web page advertising the technology. AWS Elemental services using FPGAs could speed up processing and cut down on complexity, but potentially at a higher cost than existing media services.\nDisney , Turner and Comcast (owner of NBC, the parent of CNBC) are among the media companies that have recently chosen AWS as their \"preferred\" public cloud provider.\nAmazon has been expanding its Elemental footprint in Portland, but the company hasn't publicized Elemental's chip-level work. An AWS spokesperson declined to comment for this story.\nIn 2016, the year after the acquisitions of Elemental and Annapurna, AWS announced that it would provide FPGAs for developers to use however they wanted. CME Group and National Instruments are among the companies that have shown interest in trying AWS FPGAs made by Xilinx. AWS is \"a main customer\" of Xilinx's data center business, analysts at Nomura Instinet wrote in an October note.\nMicrosoft recently started offering customers a cloud service for machine learning that uses FPGAs . Separately, Microsoft's Azure cloud offers live streaming and encoding services. Google hasn't announced any FPGA services, or live video processing tools.\n— CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this story.
