REUTERS/Stringer Critics have denounced party head Pablo Iglesias and his partner, Podemos’ spokeswoman Irene Montero, as hypocrites, saying they were betraying their leftwing principles. The couple, defending the purchase, said the home was for their own use and was not a speculative move into real estate.\nPodemos, which took around a fifth of the vote in 2016’s two elections, has become one of Spain’s four main political parties, matching and sometimes overtaking the traditional left-wing party, the Socialists (PSOE), according to polls.\nPodemos (We can) party members Pablo Iglesias and Irene Montero attend a press conference regarding the purchase of a house for over 600,000 euros (525,336 pounds) in Madrid, Spain, May 19, 2018.
