It's also got a mojito bar, cigar lounge, brew house, Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville At Sea and Q Smokehouse, a Texas barbecue restaurant.\nAs it repositions from the Atlantic to the Pacific, it will become one of the largest ships to ever navigate the Panama Canal. Norwegian Bliss measures 41 meters wide and 333 meters long (135 by 1,093 feet), while the canal is 50 meters wide and 400 meters long (164 by 1,312 feet).\nNorwegian Bliss is the largest ship in Norwegian's fleet, with 20 decks and a capacity of about 4,000 passengers. As cruise ships go, however, at least a half-dozen other ships are larger. Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, which also set sail this spring, is the world's largest, with a passenger capacity of 6,680.\nThe hull of Norwegian Bliss features images of whales and other sea creatures designed by the artist Wyland, who is known for his depictions of marine life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T17:08:44.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
