Myriad has been notified of a commercial coverage decision from a top-20, mid-Atlantic payer. Presented data from the largest-ever pharmacogenomics clinical study in patients with moderate-to-very severe depression at the American Psychiatric Association annual meeting in New York City, demonstrating that patients were 50 percent more likely to achieve remission and 30 percent more likely to respond to treatment when their medication selection was guided by the GeneSight Psychotropic genetic test. Submitted the randomized controlled trial study manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal and anticipate publication around the end of fiscal year 2018. Submitted manuscripts for the IMPACT study and a second major health economic study utilizing the Optum Healthcare Solutions dataset.\n• Vectra DA ®\nRevenue increased 34 percent year-over-year in the quarter with volumes growing in the double-digits on a sequential basis.
