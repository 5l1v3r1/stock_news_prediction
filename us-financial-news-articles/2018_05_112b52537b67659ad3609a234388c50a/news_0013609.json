Reuters has been unable to speak to him while he has been in custody.\nNo one has been charged over the deaths, which the prosecutor overseeing the case said was likely a contract killing.\nVadala is also facing separate charges of agricultural subsidy fraud by Slovakia’s National Criminal Agency.\nReporting By Tatiana Jancarikova; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:04:04.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
