This compares to GAAP net income of $5.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to results for the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP results for the first quarter of 2018 include (i) a restructuring charge of $7.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share after taxes, related to the elimination of certain positions in the U.S. operation, partially offset by (ii) an after-tax gain of $1.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to a reduction in tax reserves from resolving a multi-year contingency in the U.S.\nRevenues of $131.5 million, compared to revenues of $120.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were reduced on a net basis by $3.4 million following an accounting rule change implemented in January 2018, which defers the recognition of certain commission revenues until later in the year and accelerates certain software license fee revenues (see discussion below, “Accounting Rule Change”).\nGAAP expenses of $125.6 million and adjusted expenses of $118.4 million compared to GAAP expenses of $117.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted expenses for the first quarter of 2018 exclude the restructuring charge listed above.\nGAAP pre-tax net income of $5.9 million and adjusted pre-tax income of $13.1 million, compared to GAAP pre-tax income of $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAverage daily trading volume in the U.S. was 137 million shares versus 151 million shares in the first quarter of 2017. POSIT ® average daily U.S. volume was 53 million shares compared to 63 million shares in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal average daily U.S. volume traded through POSIT Alert ® was 14 million shares in the first quarter of 2018 and 15 million shares in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn Europe, average daily value traded in POSIT was $1.1 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2017, including the effects of currency translation. Total average daily value traded through POSIT Alert in Europe rose 55% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nRepurchases of approximately 180,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $19.80 per share, for a total of $3.6 million under ITG’s authorized share repurchase program. Repurchases since the first quarter of 2010 have totaled 17.7 million shares for $274 million, resulting in a decrease in shares outstanding, net of issuances, of approximately 25%.\nCommenting on the results, ITG President and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Troise, said, “Our continued growth in revenues and adjusted pre-tax net income, driven by new profitability records in Europe and Asia Pacific, demonstrate the progress we are making in executing on our Strategic Operating Plan. We are also committed to maintaining expense discipline across our enterprise, and we took measures this quarter to reduce our annual expenses by $10 million, including $8.5 million in savings in our U.S. operations. We are focused on achieving profitability in the U.S. in the coming quarters.”\nFirst Quarter Regional Segment Results\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed the way it measures the profitability of its regional segments to reflect the global nature of its business operations. Certain expenses that are incurred in the U.S. on behalf of the entire Company are now being allocated to the international segments. For comparability purposes, the Company has restated previously reported segment results for first quarter 2017 resulting in a decrease in U.S. expenses of $2.7 million and increases in expenses in Canada, Europe and Asia Pacific of $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The regional results in this release for the first quarter of 2017 reflect these restatements.\nNorth American revenues were $66.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $69.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nITG reported net income of $1.0 million in North America in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nU.S. revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $48.5 million, compared to $53.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. U.S. revenues were reduced in the first quarter of 2018 by $1.6 million due to the Accounting Rule Change described below. Canada revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $18.0 million, compared to $16.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nEurope and Asia Pacific revenues were $64.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $50.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nITG reported net income for its Europe and Asia Pacific operations of $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nEuropean revenues were a record $44.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $36.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAsia Pacific revenues were a record $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCorporate activity reduced GAAP net income by $11.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, including the impacts of the restructuring charge and the reduction in U.S. tax reserves. Corporate activity reduced GAAP net income by $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCorporate activity includes investment income and non-operating revenues and gains, as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within ITG's regional segments including, costs of being a public company, intangible amortization, interest expense, costs of maintaining a global transfer pricing structure, foreign exchange gains and losses and certain non-operating expenses.\nAccounting Rule Change\nBeginning in January 2018, ITG implemented a new accounting rule and is recognizing global commission revenues attributed to analytics products under bundled arrangements over the course of the annual service period. This change resulted in the deferral of $3.8 million of commission revenues in the first quarter of 2018. It is expected to result in an additional deferral of approximately $2 million in the second quarter of 2018. These deferrals are expected to be offset by increased recognition of bundled commission revenues in the second half of 2018. The new accounting rule also accelerated the recognition of software license fees, increasing revenues by $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nConference Call on 1Q18 Results\nAn investor conference call to discuss ITG’s results will be held today at 8:00 am ET.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in, or excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations, and therefore a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. In addition, management believes the presentation of these matters is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results as the items may reflect certain unique and/or non-operating items such as acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring charges, write-offs and impairments, charges associated with litigation or regulatory matters together with related expenses or items outside of management’s control.\nAdjusted expenses, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted income tax expense ( benefit) , adjusted net income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), together with related per share amounts, are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating results for our core business. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, results reported under GAAP.\nReconciliations of adjusted expenses, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted income tax expense ( benefit) , adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA to expenses, income before income tax expense, income tax expense, net income and related per share amounts as determined in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended March 31, 2018, are provided in the accompanying supplemental tables at the end of this release.\nForward Looking Statements\nIn addition to historical information, this press release may contain \"forward-looking\" statements that reflect management’s expectations for the future. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “trend,” “potential” or “continue” and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. A variety of important factors could cause results to such statements.\nCertain of these factors are noted throughout ITG’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and its Form 10-Qs (as amended, if applicable) and include, but are not limited to, general economic, business, credit, political and financial market conditions, both internationally and domestically, financial market volatility, fluctuations in market trading volumes, effects of inflation, adverse changes or volatility in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, evolving industry regulations and increased regulatory scrutiny, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings or governmental or regulatory investigations and customer or shareholder reaction to, or further proceedings or sanctions based on, such matters, the volatility of our stock price, changes in tax policy or accounting rules, the ability of the Company to utilize its loss and tax credit carryforwards, the actions of both current and potential new competitors, changes in commission pricing, rapid changes in technology, errors or malfunctions in our systems or technology, operational risks related to misconduct or errors by our employees or entities with which we do business, cash flows into or redemptions from equity mutual funds, ability to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of our securities business and the related clearing of our customers’ trades, customer trading patterns, the success of our products and service offerings, our ability to continue to innovate and meet the demands of our customers for new or enhanced products, our ability to protect our intellectual property, our ability to execute on strategic initiatives or transactions, our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock in the future.\nThe included herein represent ITG’s views as of the date of this release.
