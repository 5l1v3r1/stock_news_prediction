Net commissions and fees from securities services were RMB45.1 million (US$7.2 million), an increase of 246.9% compared to the previous quarter.\nFor the quarter ended\n% Change\nIn RMB million, except otherwise specified\nMarch 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nYoY\nQoQ\nRevenues\n1,104.6\n386.1\n268.5\n(75.7%)\n(30.5%)\nNet commissions and fees\n1,053.5\n286.7\n242.6\n(77.0%)\n(15.4%)\nNet commissions and fees from securities\nservices\n–\n13.0\n45.1\n246.9%\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Yintech\n381.3\n(54.6)\n(50.3)\nEPS per ADS - diluted (RMB)\n5.14\n(0.72)\n(0.69)\nNon-GAAP data\nNon-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to\nYintech\n397.4\n61.4\n(29.1)\nNon-GAAP EPS per ADS - diluted (RMB)\n5.36\n0.81\n(0.40)\n\"We started to consolidate Forthright Securities' results of operations during this quarter, which strengthened and diversified our securities services business,\" commented Mr. Wenbin Chen, Chairman and CEO of Yintech. \"On the other hand, our commodities services business was adversely impacted by unfavorable market conditions as well as the Chinese New Year holiday. We are pleased to announce that our board of directors has appointed Mr. Yonghong Fan, a veteran of China's financial industry, as our independent director and audit committee member. We strongly believe Yonghong's deep experience in managing a wide variety of financial institutions, and his in-depth knowledge of investments acquired over a long and successful career, will bring significant value to Yintech.\"\nMr. Hongchen Yu, Interim CFO of Yintech, added. \"In the first quarter of 2018, net commissions and fees from securities services continued their strong growth momentum thanks to our focus and efforts in expanding this segment, and we expect to deliver further growth in the coming quarters. In addition, our board of directors has approved a one-year extension of our share repurchase program. In a period of continued market volatility, we believe this will further contribute to our constant focus on shareholder value. We see sustainable strengths in our business and are confident in our ability to increase shareholder value in the future.\"\nAccounting Policy Change\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (''FASB'') issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which outlines a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to recognize revenue when the company transfers control of promised goods and services to the customer. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 to defer the mandatory effective date for public entities to annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017.\nEffective January 1, 2018, Yintech adopted the new revenue standard, ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the cumulative effect method.\nYintech has evaluated the impact of this new standard, including its impact on the Company's business processes, systems and controls, and determined that because substantially all of the Company's contracts do not contain multiple-elements arrangement, and also the Company records substantially all of its revenue and costs at a single point in time when service is delivered or completed, the new standard does not affect the total revenues or operating earnings recognized for each contract, nor the timing of when those amounts are recognized.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues for the quarter were RMB268.5 million (US$42.8 million), compared to RMB1,104.6 million in the same quarter last year and RMB386.1 million in the previous quarter. The decreases were mainly due to the decreases in net commissions and fees and other revenues.\nNet commissions and fees for the quarter were RMB242.6 million (US$38.7 million), compared to RMB1,053.5 million in the same quarter last year and RMB286.7 million in the previous quarter.\nNet commissions and fees from commodities services for the quarter were RMB197.5 million (US$31.5 million), a decrease of 27.8% from the previous quarter, primarily as a result of the decrease in customer trading volume. Customer trading volume was RMB499.5 billion (US$79.6 billion) during the quarter, a decrease of 30.3% from the previous quarter.\nNet commissions and fees from securities services for the quarter were RMB45.1 million (US$7.2 million), an increase of 246.9% from the previous quarter, mainly due to the consolidation of Forthright Securities and an organic growth of securities advisory and securities information platform business.\nEffective fee rate (representing net commissions and fees from commodities services as a percentage of customer trading volume) for the quarter was 0.040%, compared with 0.076% in the same quarter last year and 0.038% in the previous quarter.\nExpenses for the quarter were RMB309.1 million (US$49.3 million), a decrease of 51.0% from RMB630.4 million in the same quarter last year and a decrease of 26.6% from RMB421.4 million in the previous quarter. The decreases were mainly due to cost control measures implemented on advertising and promotion expenses, as well as variable components of employee compensation and benefits.\nNet loss for the quarter was RMB63.1 million (US$10.1 million), compared to net income of RMB376.1 million in the same quarter last year and net loss of RMB63.6 million in the previous quarter.\nNet loss attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB50.3 million (US$8.0 million), compared to net income of RMB381.3 million in the same quarter last year and net loss of RMB54.6 million in the previous quarter.\nDiluted loss per ADS for the quarter was RMB0.69 (US$0.11), compared to diluted earnings per ADS of RMB5.14 in the same quarter last year and diluted loss per ADS of RMB0.72 in the previous quarter.\nNon-GAAP net loss attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB29.1 million (US$4.6 million), compared to net income of RMB397.4 million in the same quarter last year and net income of RMB61.4 million in the previous quarter.\nNon-GAAP diluted loss per ADS for the quarter were RMB0.40 (US$0.06), compared with non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS of RMB5.36 in the same quarter last year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.81 in the previous quarter.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash of RMB527.2 million (US$84.0 million) and short term investments of RMB1,314.1 million (US$209.5 million), compared with RMB690.5 million and RMB1,212.0 million as of December 31, 2017, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Total shareholders' equity of Yintech was RMB3,604.1 million (US$574.6 million), compared with RMB3,576.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on the information available as of the date of this press release, Yintech provides the following outlook, which reflects the Company's current and preliminary view and is subject to change:\n2018 Second Quarter Guidance\nRevenues will be in the range of RMB280 million to RMB300 million.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn May 29, 2018, Yintech's board of directors approved a share repurchase program (\"Share Repurchase Program\"), effective June 2, 2018, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to US$30 million worth of its issued and outstanding American Depositary Shares over the course of 12 months. The Share Repurchase Program extends the Company's previous share repurchase program that was effective for 12 months from June 2, 2017.\nYintech's proposed repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means depending on market conditions and other factors as well as subject to relevant rules under United States securities regulations.\nThe share repurchase program will be funded with Yintech's available cash balance. As of March 31, 2018, Yintech had cash of RMB527.2 million (US$84.0 million) and short term investments of RMB1,314.1 million (US$209.5 million).\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of all forms of share-based compensation, as well as amortization of intangible assets in relation to the acquisition of Gold Master. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measures is set forth in the table captioned \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" below.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company may be prepared differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWhen evaluating the Company's operating performance in the periods presented, management reviewed the non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS results reflecting adjustments to exclude the impact of share-based compensation as well as amortization of intangible assets in relation to the acquisition of Gold Master to supplement U.S. GAAP financial data. As such, the Company believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP net income and the diluted non-GAAP income per ADS provides important supplemental information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations in a manner consistent with that used by management. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the Company recognized significant amounts of expenses for the restricted shares and share options, as well as amortization of intangible assets in relation to the acquisition of Gold Master in the periods presented. The Company utilized the non-GAAP financial results to make financial results comparable period to period and to better understand its historical business operations.\nCurrency Conversion\nThis announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.
