(TSX.V:SCZ) (the \"Company\" or \"Santacruz\") reports on the operating results from the Veta Grande Project in Zacatecas, Mexico and the Rosario Project in San Luis Potosi, Mexico for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company produced a total of 154,175 silver equivalent ounces in Q1 2018 (Q1 2017 – 223,968; Q4 2017 – 139,670). As compared to Q1 2017, the decreased production reflects 30% less tonnes milled at the Rosario Project and a 32% decrease in the average silver equivalent head grade at the Veta Grande Project. As compared to Q4 2017, the increased production reflects an 11% increase in the average silver equivalent head grade at the Rosario Project and a 98% increase in tonnes milled at the Veta Grande Project offset by 22% decrease in the average silver equivalent head grade.\n\"During Q1 of 2018 management focussed activities on aggressively developing the Veta Grande main ramp in order to access in situ mineralized material from Q3 onwards. This strategy has resulted in lower head grades and reduced metal production for the short run but will pave the way for achieving targeted production for Q3 and beyond.\" stated Arturo Prestamo. He continued, \"At Rosario the millfeed continued to be a blend of development muck and mineralized material from production stopes. During Q2 the percentage of development muck will decrease as more production stopes come online and by Q3 we expect to be at targeted production and head grade levels.\"\n2018 First Quarter Consolidated Production Results\nSummary of Production Results\n2018 Q1\n2017 Q4\n2017 Q1\nMaterial Processed (tonnes milled)\n48,068\n30,975\n45,474\nSilver eqv. ounce production (1)\n154,175\n139,670\n223,968\nSilver production (ounces)\n48,102\n44,316\n92,154\nGold production (ounces)\n135\n239\n326\nLead production (tonnes)\n134\n94\n144\nZinc production (tonnes)\n449\n412\n559\nAverage Head Grade (g/t Ag Eqv.)\n167\n194\n216\n2018 First Quarter Veta Grande Project Production Results\nSummary of Production Results\n2018 Q1\n2017 Q4\n2017 Q1\nMaterial Processed (tonnes milled)\n34,928\n17,657\n26,751\nSilver eqv. ounce production (1)\n71,410\n64,987\n108,728\nSilver production (ounces)\n32,413\n25,665\n57,598\nSilver head grade (g/t)\n62\n78\n117\nSilver recovery (%)\n47\n58\n57\nGold production (ounces)\n56\n53\n131\nLead production (tonnes)\n109\n70\n99\nZinc production (tonnes)\n118\n163\n177\nAverage Head Grade (g/t Ag Eqv.)\n142\n183\n209\n2018 First Quarter Rosario Project Production Results\nSummary of Production Results\n2018 Q1\n2017 Q4\n2017 Q1\nMaterial Processed (tonnes milled)\n13,140\n13,317\n18,723\nSilver eqv. ounce production (1)\n82,765\n74,683\n115,240\nSilver production (ounces)\n15,689\n18,652\n34,556\nSilver head grade (g/t)\n43\n53\n66\nSilver recovery (%)\n85\n82\n86\nGold production (ounces)\n79\n186\n195\nLead production (tonnes)\n25\n23\n45\nZinc production (tonnes)\n331\n249\n382\nAverage Head Grade (g/t Ag Eqv.)\n232\n209\n226\n(1\nAgEqvOz = (Au*Pau)+(Ag*Pag)+(Pb*Ppb*2205)+(Zn*Pzn*2205)\n(Pag)\nMetal Prices 2018: Ag $17.00, Au $1,295, Pb $1.00, Zn $1.35\nMetal Prices 2017: Ag $16.00, Au $1,150, Pb $1.00, Zn $1.15\nUpdate - Veta Grande Project\nTwo important initiatives are currently ongoing at the Veta Grande Project. One is the ongoing first phase of a surface drilling campaign consisting of 6,000 metres on the Veta Grande vein and a 3,000-metre underground drill program on the Armados vein. The plan is to complete a 20,000-metre drill program during 2018 funded by Carrizal Mining, S.A. de C.V. To this end, a second surface drill rig is expected on property shortly. With respect to the current program, the first two surface drill holes have been completed and five underground drill holes been completed. Assays are pending.\nThe other initiative is to drive a second production ramp to access the Armados vein while concurrently continuing with development work on the Veta Grande vein. .\nUpdate - Rosario Project\nAs disclosed previously, during Q4 2017 the Company took the decision to consolidate all of its Rosario Project mining operations to the Membrillo Prospect. Mine development has now reached Level 3 and mine production is increasing. Management anticipates that the targeted production rate (350 tpd) and head grade will be achieved by the end of Q2.\nAbout Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd.\nSantacruz is a Mexican focused silver company with two producing silver projects, Veta Grande and Rosario, and two exploration properties, the Minillas property and Zacatecas properties. The Company is managed by a technical team of professionals with proven track records in developing, operating and discovering silver mines in Mexico.

Accordingly, there is increased uncertainty and economic and technical risks of failure associated with this production decision. Production and economic variables may vary considerably, due to the absence of a complete and detailed site analysis according to and in accordance with NI 43-101.\nVeta Grande Project\nThe decision to commence production at Veta Grande Project was not based on a feasibility study on mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.
