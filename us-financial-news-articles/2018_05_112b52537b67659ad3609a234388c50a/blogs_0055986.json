Pentagon official Randall Schriver was part of the U.S. team, the official said.\nThe Washington Post first reported that the team, which also included Allison Hooker, the Korea expert on the White House National Security Council, met with Choe Son Hui, the North Korean vice foreign minister.\nThe Post said the meetings would continue Monday and Tuesday at Tongilgak, the North's building in Panmunjom, where the truce suspending the 1950-53 Korean War was signed.\nIn their Saturday meeting, Kim reaffirmed his commitment to \"complete\" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to a planned meeting with Trump, Moon said.\n\"Chairman Kim and I have agreed that the June 12 summit should be held successfully, and that our quest for the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization and a perpetual peace regime should not be halted,\" Moon said.\nMoon acknowledged Pyongyang and Washington may have differing expectations of what denuclearization means and he urged both sides to hold working-level talks to resolve their differences.\nThe United States has demanded the \"complete, verifiable, and irreversible\" dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Pyongyang has rejected unilateral disarmament and has always couched its language in terms of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nIn previous, failed talks, North Korea said it could consider giving up its arsenal if Washington removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T21:39:52.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
