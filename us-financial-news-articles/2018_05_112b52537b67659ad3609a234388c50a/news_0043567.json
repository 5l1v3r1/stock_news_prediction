We look forward to continuing these single agent studies as well as combination trials with immunotherapy treatments.\"\nASCO abstracts include:\nTitle: A Phase 1 Study of Novel dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL Inhibitor APG-1252 in Patients with Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) or Other Solid Tumor\nSession Date and Time: Monday, June 4 at 8:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. CDT\nAbstract Number: 2594\nAPG-1252 was designed to reduce the target platelet toxicity seen with dual inhibitors Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, while maintaining strong antitumor activity. Preliminary results showed that APG-1252 was well-tolerated with no hematologic toxicity reported. There was one confirmed partial response in a metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patient. Dose escalation continues in SCLC and other solid tumors.\nTitle: A Phase 1 Study of a Novel IAP Inhibitor APG-1387 In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors\nSession Date and Time: Monday, June 4 at 8:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. CDT\nAbstract Number: 2593\nAPG-1387 was well-tolerated with manageable adverse events. Preliminary responses indicated positive host immune responses, suggesting synergy with immunotherapy agents. Studies are continuing with APG-1387 in combination with immunotherapy agents in patients with advanced solid tumors or hematologic malignancies.\nAbout Ascentage Pharma\nAscentage Pharma is a globally-focused, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapies for cancers, hepatitis B and age-related diseases.
