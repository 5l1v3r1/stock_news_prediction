(the \"Company\") today announced a loss to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $2,212,000, or $0.09 per share, compared to first quarter 2017 loss to common stockholders of $4,918,000, or $0.23 per share.\nDiscretionary cash flow for 2018 was $9,394,000, as compared to $9,206,000 for the comparable 2017 period. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities to discretionary cash flow.\nProduction for 2018 was 6.1 Bcfe (67.8 MMcfe/d), compared to 5.2 Bcfe (58.1 MMcfe/d) for the comparable period of 2017. The increase in production as compared to 2017 was due primarily to the Company's East Texas drilling program throughout 2017 and its Thunder Bayou recompletion in 2017. On January 31, 2018, however, the Company sold its Gulf of Mexico properties, which contributed approximately 4.7 MMcfe/d to first quarter 2018 production, as compared to 15.5 MMcfe/d in 2017. Stated on an Mcfe basis, unit prices including the effects of hedges for 2018 were $4.08 per Mcfe, as compared to $3.98 per Mcfe in 2017. Oil and gas sales during 2018 were $24,917,000, as compared to $20,772,000 in 2017.\nLease operating expenses (“LOE”) for 2018 decreased to $7,040,000, as compared to $7,076,000 in 2017. On a per unit basis LOE per Mcfe was $1.15 for 2018, as compared to $1.35 in 2017. The decrease in per unit lease operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily a result of the divestiture of the Company's Gulf of Mexico assets in January 2018 which had a higher per unit rate as compared to the Company's onshore properties.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) on oil and gas properties for 2018 was $1.06 per Mcfe, as compared to $1.15 per Mcfe in 2017. The decrease in the per unit DD&A rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily the result of the Company's Gulf of Mexico divestiture in January 2018.\nInterest expense for 2018 was $7,481,000, as compared to $7,258,000 in 2017. During the three month period ended March 31, 2018, capitalized interest totaled $421,000, as compared to $305,000 during the 2017 period.\nProduction taxes for 2018 totaled $1,227,000, as compared to $308,000 in 2017. The increase in production taxes during the 2018 period is primarily the result of increases in production and pricing as well as the expiration of a two-year severance tax exemption on the Company's Thunder Bayou well in June 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2018 totaled $3,300,000, as compared to $3,153,000 during the comparable 2017 periods. Capitalized for 2018 totaled $1,430,000, as compared to $1,334,000 during the comparable 2017 period.\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to the oil and gas operations of the Company for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Production: Oil (Bbls) 100,175 132,678 Gas (Mcf) 4,604,021 3,524,966 Ngl (Mcfe) 897,103 904,206 Total Production (Mcfe) 6,102,174 5,225,240 Avg.

Discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash flow provided by operating activities. In addition, since discretionary cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, it might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nFor further information, contact: Matt Quantz, Manager – Corporate Communications (337) 232-7028, www.petroquest.com\nSource:PetroQuest Energy, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f4de7bdf-d193-4348-b345-819d987337ce"], "published": "2018-05-08T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T01:07:44.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
