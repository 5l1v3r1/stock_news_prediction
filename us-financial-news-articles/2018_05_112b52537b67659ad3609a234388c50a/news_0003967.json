We believe he has the skillset and vision to lead Gemphire, and we look forward to the contributions he will make.”\n“My decision to take on this role is driven by a strong conviction that gemcabene is one of the most exciting therapeutic candidates in cardiovascular and metabolic disease today and that it has enormous commercial potential,” said Dr. Steven Gullans. “I believe we will see broader recognition of the true value of gemcabene over the next year, beginning with the near-term top line data from our INDIGO-1 trial in hypertriglyceridemia, as we execute on clinical proof of concept trials in NAFLD and NASH, and as we finalize our plans for registration trials in dyslipidemia. I am proud to work with Gemphire’s very capable and talented leadership team.”\nDr. Gullans has served on the Gemphire Therapeutics’ board of directors since April 2016.
