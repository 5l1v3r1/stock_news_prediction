(NASDAQ:NODK) today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to first quarter 2017:\nNet income attributable to NI Holdings of $6.1 million compared to $4.7 million for 2017. Net premiums earned of $36.1 million, a 10.1% increase from 2017. Loss and LAE ratio of 52.2%, compared to 54.0% for 2017. Expense ratio of 32.9%, compared to 30.5% for 2017. Earnings per share of $0.27, compared to $0.21 a year ago. Combined ratio of 85.1%, compared to 84.5% for 2017. Effective tax rate of 19.1%, compared to 32.5% for 2017. Total equity of $258.6 million as of March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased with our results for first quarter 2018. Our earned premiums grew 10% while producing profitable underwriting results for the quarter,” said Michael J. Alexander, President and CEO. “A strong first quarter for both growth and profit is critical as we normally experience a higher frequency of weather related losses in the second and third quarters.”\n“The lower loss and LAE ratio from a year ago reflects improved underwriting results for our Private Passenger and Non-Standard automobile lines of business combined with fewer collapse losses, which impacted our Farm line of business in 2017. In addition, rate adjustments implemented throughout 2017 across the Private Passenger Auto, Non-Standard Auto, Home, and Farm lines of business also helped improve the underwriting results.”\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”). The TCJA was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In addition to other provisions, the TCJA lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will not hold an earnings conference call for first quarter 2018. Our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC is available on the Company’s website at http://www.niholdingsinc.com . Our latest Financial Supplement is also available on the Company’s website.\nAbout the Company\nNI Holdings, Inc. is an insurance holding company.
