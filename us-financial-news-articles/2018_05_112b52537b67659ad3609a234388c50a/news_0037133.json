Feb 5, 2017; Houston, TX, USA; NFL former player Terrell Owens on the field before Super Bowl LI between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports\nOn a radio spot in Dallas, he took aim at Dallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett, saying it’s “mind-boggling” that Garrett still has the job after seven seasons.\n“When you really look at it, it doesn’t make sense for Jason Garrett to continue to have his job,” Owens said Wednesday during an appearance on 105.3 The Fan. “(The Cowboys are) not really expanding or not really progressing with the organization, even as a team, under his coaching tenure there.”\nGarrett has a 67-53 regular-season record, including his 5-3 mark as the interim coach in 2010. He has led the Cowboys to the playoffs twice, in 2014 and 2016. Garrett signed a five-year deal after the Cowboys went 12-4 in 2014 . Garrett was named NFL Coach of the Year in 2016.\nOwens, who spent three seasons in Dallas during a 15-year Hall of Fame career, went on to compare Garrett’s situation to that of recently fired Toronto Raptors coach Dwane Casey of the NBA.\n“(Casey) was voted unanimous coach of the year, has taken Toronto to the playoffs, had three straight years of winning 50-plus games and then they don’t make it beyond what the expectations are within that organization and he gets fired,” Owens said. “And then you have Jason Garrett, who has no accomplishments, not even close to that, and he continues to still have a job.”\nThe Cowboys’ offseason decision to let Dez Bryant go also seems to factor into Owens’ argument.\n“It all boils down to players being the scapegoat for his inability to lead the team as he should. For me, it’s mind-boggling. I don’t understand it. And I think Jerry (Jones) - again, he’s the owner at the end of the day, he has to feel good with himself about the decisions - but I just don’t understand why this guy still has a job.”\nIn an April interview with the NFL Network, Bryant, who has yet to sign with another team, suggested players loyal to Garrett had a hand in the Cowboys’ decision.\n“I’ll say this right here: I believe that ‘Garrett guys’ (are responsible). I would say that,” Bryant said.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T22:29:13.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
