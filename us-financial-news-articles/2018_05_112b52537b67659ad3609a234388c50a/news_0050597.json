She has long stressed Islam is part of Germany and has called for tolerance.\nSichert’s comments came after Inger Stojberg, Denmark’s Integration Minister, caused furor on Monday by urging practicing Muslims to take vacation during Ramadan to avoid a negative impact on society.\n“It can simply be dangerous for all of us if the bus driver doesn’t eat or drink during a whole day, and you don’t perform at nearly the same level at the factory or the hospital if you don’t eat or drink during the bright hours of the day for a full month,” she said in a letter printed in Danish newspaper BT.\nHer letter was met with widespread criticism, including from within her own Liberal Party.
