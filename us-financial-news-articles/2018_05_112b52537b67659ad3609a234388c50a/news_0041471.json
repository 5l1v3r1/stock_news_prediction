The political fallout from Italy could be relatively well contained as a result.”\nFor now the euro also faced pressure from a bullish dollar, which has been boosted this week as U.S. benchmark yields broke above the 3 percent threshold to a seven-year high.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 93.298 after rising on Wednesday to 93.632, its highest since Dec. 19.\nThe dollar was steady at 110.380 yen. A rise above 110.450 would take the greenback to its highest since Feb. 2 versus its Japanese peer.\nThe Australian dollar was little changed at $0.7514 after gaining 0.6 percent overnight, buoyed by a rise in prices of commodities such as copper.\nOther commodity-linked currencies like the Canadian dollar also advanced as equities bounced back overnight from the previous day’s losses caused by the spike in U.S. yields.\nThe loonie stood firm at C$1.2785 per dollar after gaining 0.67 percent on Wednesday. The commodity-linked currency is sensitive to movements in equity markets, which are seen as a key indicator of the prospects for global growth.\nThe New Zealand dollar traded at $0.6899 after managing to pull back the previous day from a five-month trough of $0.6851.
