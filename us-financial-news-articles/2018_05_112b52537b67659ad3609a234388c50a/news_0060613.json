If construction begins in 2018 as scheduled, production would kick off in 2022, Tweddle said.\nBear Creek had initially planned to finance Corani with earnings form its proposed silver project Santa Ana, also in southern Peru. But a previous presidential administration revoked Bear Creek’s right to build Santa Ana in 2011 after deadly protests against the proposed mine.\nLate last year, Bear Creek won the right to develop Santa Ana after suing Peru. The current government of President Martin Vizcarra must now pay the company $31 million.\nTweddle said Bear Creek was waiting to talk with the current government about Santa Ana before taking any next steps on the project. “Right now Santa Ana is still in our portfolio as a concession,” Tweddle said.\nReporting by Mitra Taj and Marco Aquino; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
