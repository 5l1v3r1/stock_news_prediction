The utility’s installed capacity rose 3 percent from a year earlier.\nIn Portugal, EDP incurred losses from a government-imposed reduction in the final compensation paid to the former monopoly for giving up some long-term power-purchase deals, an increase of clawback tax in August 2017, and higher costs of the so-called social tariff for low-income households.\nWithout these effects, EBITDA would have risen 2 percent, the company said.\nEDP said EBITDA at its Brazilian unit rose 18 percent in local currency, but fell 1 percent in euros due to a sharp depreciation of the Brazilian real.\nOn Wednesday, EDP’s wind energy subsidiary EDP Renewables posted a 39 percent rise in quarterly profit thanks to some asset sales, but its revenues remained flat.\nEDP shares closed 1 percent higher on Thursday before the results were announced, outperforming the broader market in Lisbon, up 0.2 percent.\n$1 = 0.8403 euros Reporting by Andrei Khalip; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:08:24.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
