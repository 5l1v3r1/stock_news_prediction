Fair play to (caretaker manager) Darren Moore and the coaches. The mental side is 50-50 with the fitness.\n“The lads really put their hearts on the line and were brilliant. We know we are a threat at set pieces and we managed to nick one.” Slideshow (5 Images)\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Livermore struck deep into stoppage time to send the home fans at The Hawthorns into raptures after both sides had missed good chances in a scrappy game dominated by the visitors.\nFoster made several telling saves, having denied Victor Wanyama and Harry Kane in the first half and then kept out a pair of Eric Lamela efforts after the break.\nCrucially, he produced a spectacular stop in the dying seconds after Livermore had scored to keep alive West Brom’s dream of pulling off what would be a great escape.\nJay Rodriguez had a header cleared off the line and strike partner Salomon Rondon scuffed a close-range shot at the other end as anxiety crept into West Brom before Livermore capped the home side’s late onslaught.\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino was unhappy with his team’s lack of cutting edge.\n“In football you can dominate but you need to be clinical in front of goal and today wasn’t good,” he said.\n“I am very disappointed because we lost the game. Still, we have it in our hands to be in the top four.” Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; Editing by Ed Osmond and Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T20:10:18.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
