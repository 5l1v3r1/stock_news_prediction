As wind and rain began to pummel southern Oman during the day, they extended the closure of the city’s airport through Saturday.\nMekunu was expected to weaken to a tropical storm before reaching southeastern Saudi Arabia on Saturday, according to the kingdom’s meteorological authority.\nYemen is already grappling with one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced three million others, triggered a cholera outbreak and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation, according to the United Nations.\nReporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf, Writing by Katie Paul, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:46:45.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
