His office said on Monday that his doctor had requested to see Buhari and the president would return home on Saturday.\n“President Buhari just returned,” his spokesman, Garba Shehu said in a tweet.\nShehu said earlier in the week it would be a “routine check-up”.\nHowever, the surprise announcement that Buhari would travel to see his doctor renewed concerns about his health weeks after he said he would seek re-election in a poll to be held in February next year.\nBuhari’s critics say he is too ill to be at the helm of one of the continent’s biggest economies.
