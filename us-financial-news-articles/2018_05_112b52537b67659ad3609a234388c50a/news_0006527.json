The dual-carriageway bridge was slated to open in November 2015 but today sits abandoned.\n“We’re all hopeful the bridge will open soon,” said Zhao Bin, a Chinese trader who does business with North Korea and considered buying property in Dandong last week.\nINDPRK’s Che, who has a prominent social media presence, said Dandong New Zone transaction prices had risen from about 4,000 yuan per square metre to 5,500 to 6,000 yuan, which he attributes to the improving situation on the Korean peninsula. He warned that Dandong prices were so frothy they may have even peaked.\n“I was keen to buy but I think it’s too late now,” he said.\nOUT-OF-TOWNERS BOOST SALES\nAround one-third of buyers over the recent Labour Day weekend holiday were from out of town, taking advantage of time off to scout properties, according to Mr. Liao, an agent at Gold Key Real Estate in Dandong, who also declined to give his full name, whereas locals made up the vast majority of buyers in much of April.\nSales of residential properties rose almost 30 percent in Dandong’s of Zhenxing District, which includes the New Zone, last month from March, according to data from the local housing authority. A total of 967 apartments were sold in April, it posted on the official website.\nAverage home prices in Dandong rose nearly 1 percent in April from March, according to data from the China Real Estate Association, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the same period a year earlier, although city-wide averages tend not to fully reflect big price fluctuations at individual projects.\nDandong’s real estate registration office released a statement last week saying it was unable to keep up with the sudden rise in people registering apartments so people needed to make an appointment to visit the office ahead of time, according to state-owned Securities Times newspaper.\nA woman answering the phone at Dandong’s real estate registration office said the new system was not connected to North Korea, but because several projects had recently been completed so more people were purchasing apartments.
