Volumes in the southern Latin America region jumped 5.7 percent, while profit and EBITDA also grew significantly. The Central American region also posted significant growth in top line, EBITDA, and profit. $1 = 3.56 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery; Additional reporting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Brad Haynes and Phil Berlowitz", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T17:57:51.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
