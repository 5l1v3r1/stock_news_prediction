Marcus Semien added insurance with an eighth-inning RBI single.\nAdam Jones homered off Daniel Mengden in the first inning. Chris Davis, Mark Trumbo and Danny Valencia had run-scoring singles in the sixth for Baltimore, which dropped its 10th straight road game and fourth straight game overall.\nBaltimore committed three errors, and at 8-24, the Orioles are off to their worst start since opening the 1988 season with 28 losses in 32 games.\nMengden allowed one run and three hits in five innings. He struck out five, walked one and threw 54 of 84 pitches for strikes.\nCashner threw 37 of his 114 pitches in the first inning. He allowed four runs (three earned) and six hits in 4 2/3 innings but avoided his fourth straight loss, instead drawing a no-decision.\nLou Trivino (2-0) recorded an inning-ending double play in the sixth and pitched a scoreless seventh. Blake Treinen pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save.\nJones gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead when he sent a 1-1 fastball over the center field fence with one out in the first. After Jones hit his fifth homer, the A’s quickly went ahead.\nShortly after second baseman Jace Peterson dropped the throw from shortstop Manny Machado on a force attempt, Davis made it 3-1 by blasting a 1-0 fastball over the center field wall for his eighth homer. Six pitches later, Olson lifted a 2-2 fastball over the right-center field wall for his fourth homer and first in 13 games.\nAfter generating little against Mengden, Baltimore began the sixth with four straight singles off Yusmeiro Petit. Davis made it 4-2 with a single past the diving attempt of Lowrie and the O’s cut the deficit to one on a single to left by Trumbo.\nAfter Petit struck out Pedro Alvarez, Davis scored on Valencia’s single up the middle, but the Orioles were unable to go ahead as Peterson bounced into a double play.\nOakland put runners at second and third in the sixth when Stephen Piscotty reached on Machado’s throwing error and took third on Jonathan Lucroy’s double. Piscotty was thrown out at the plate on a chopper to second base but Lowrie sneaked a single into right field.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T16:24:30.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
