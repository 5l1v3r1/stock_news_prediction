Lurid pictures of him lying in a pool of blood were published, and officials suggested Russia was behind the assassination, something Moscow flatly denied.\nA day later, Babchenko appeared in public alive, and Ukrainian security officials said they had faked his death to thwart and expose what they described as a Russian plot to assassinate him.\nThat drew criticism from some media defenders and commentators who questioned whether the ruse and the false outpouring of grief and finger-pointing at Russia it generated had undermined credibility in journalism itself and in Kiev, handing the Kremlin a propaganda gift in the process.\nBabchenko hit back in a joint interview in Kiev on Thursday, saying that he had gone along with the ruse, organized by Ukrainian security officials, because he feared for his life.\n“Everyone who says this undermines trust in journalists: what would you do in my place, if they came to you and said there is a hit out on you?” Babchenko said, saying concerns about his life had to take precedence over worries about journalistic ethics.\nBabchenko, who said he was exhausted after playing out the elaborate ruse, said that when Ukrainian security officials had approached him with information about a Russian plot to kill him, “my first reaction was: ‘To hell with you, I want to pack a bag and disappear to the North Pole.’”\n“But then I realized, where do you hide? Skripal also tried to hide.”\nBritish authorities say that Skripal, a former Russian double agent, was poisoned in March with a military-grade nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury where he lived after leaving Russia in a spy swap.\nBritain says Russia is culpable for the poisoning, an allegation Moscow denies.\nBabchenko said he now lived in a secure location and felt safe for now. Related Coverage Russian journalist: pig's blood, make-up artist helped fake his death\nHis reported murder kindled a war of words between Ukraine and Russia, which have been at loggerheads since a popular revolt in Ukraine in 2014 toppled a Russian-backed government in favor of a pro-Western one.\nIt also produced international condemnation, in part because several prominent Russians critical of Putin have been murdered in recent years, three of them in Ukraine. Opposition groups and human rights organizations say the Kremlin is behind the killings. The Kremlin denies this. RESURRECTED IN MORGUE\nBabchenko disclosed for the first time details of how he had helped fake his own death.\nHe said that a make-up artist had come to his apartment to give him the appearance of a shooting victim, that he was given a T-shirt with bullet holes in it to wear, and that pig’s blood was poured over him.\nHe played dead, he said, while medical teams - who were in on the ruse - took him to hospital in an ambulance and then certified him as dead and sent him to a morgue.\n“Once the gates of the morgue closed behind me, I was resurrected,” Babchenko said, saying he had then washed off the fake blood and dressed himself in a sheet.\n“Then I watched the news and saw what a great guy I had been,” he said, referring to media tributes to him after his death was widely reported.\nAsked about his next steps, he said: “I plan to get some decent sleep, maybe get drunk, and then wake up in two or three days.” Russian dissident journalist Arkady Babchenko (R) takes his portrait from deputy chief of the Crimean Tatar channel ATR Aider Muzhdabaiev as he visits the office of the channel in Kiev, Ukraine May 31, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\nHe quipped that nobody had shown him a letter from President Vladimir Putin ordering his murder, but that despite initial scepticism he now believed assertions from the Ukrainian security service that he had been targeted in a Russian plot.\nWhile saying he did not know why Russian authorities would want to kill him, he said he personally loathed Putin, whom he accused of starting several wars and being responsible for thousands of deaths.\nA Kiev court said on Thursday it was examining a request to detain a man suspected of organizing what it called a terrorist act, a reference to the alleged murder plot.\nAnother man, who described himself as a lawyer for the suspect who was named, said his client was innocent. CREDIBILITY\nThe Kremlin, which had called accusations of Russian involvement in the fake hit “the height of cynicism”, said on Thursday it was glad Babchenko was alive, but found the staging of his death strange.\nUkrainian politicians robustly defended the ruse.\nInterior Minister Arsen Avakov said he was surprised and shocked by “pseudo-moral” criticism from abroad, while Anton Gerashchenko, a prominent lawmaker and adviser to the minister, said the operation had been vital in order to trace the trail from the would-be assassin to his handlers.\nThey had to believe the plan to kill Babchenko had succeeded “and force them to take a number of actions that will be documented by the investigation,” he wrote on social media.\n“After all, Arthur Conan Doyle’s hero Sherlock Holmes successfully used the method of staging his own death for the effective investigation of complex and intricate crimes. No matter how painful it was for his family and Dr. Watson.”\nSome remained unconvinced.

It is the duty of the state to provide correct information to the public.”\nA senior EU diplomat in Kiev said Ukraine’s actions were understandable, but hoped the authorities would provide more information about what had happened.\n“No one is angry, unlike some in other places, but we hope(Ukraine) understands that international goodwill is a finite resource - even if they are right and it’s a war against a superior enemy,” the diplomat wrote to Reuters in a message.
