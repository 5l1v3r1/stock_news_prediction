This represents 33 consecutive months of dividends declared since the Series A Preferred Stock was initially sold in November 2015.\n“Yesterday we announced our signing of an acquisition agreement that, subject to closing, could increase our revenues by at least 50%,” said Bill Korn, Chief Financial Officer. “The capital we’ve raised through prior offerings of our non-convertible Series A Preferred Stock has enabled us to negotiate favorable deal terms and move quickly on attractive opportunities, such as the one we recently announced. We welcome the accelerating trend of consolidation in our industry and believe that we are well positioned to pursue compelling opportunities as they continue to emerge.”\nHolders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 11% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.75 per annum per share). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are payable monthly on the 15 th day of each month; provided that if any dividend payment date is not a business day, then the dividend may be paid on the next succeeding business day. Dividends are payable to holders of record on the applicable record date, which shall be the last day of the calendar month, whether or not a business day.\nMTBC’s Series A Preferred Stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “MTBCP.”\nThe following table shows the monthly dividends and associated record and payment dates:\nJune 2018 July 2018 August 2018 Dividend per share $ 0.22917 $ 0.22917 $ 0.22917 Ex-dividend date June 28, 2018 July 30, 2018 August 30, 2018 Record date June 30, 2018 July 31, 2018 August 31, 2018 Payment date July 16, 2018 August 15, 2018 September 17, 2018 About MTBC\nMedical Transcription Billing, Corp. is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers throughout the United States.
