A worker paints the new name on a pub in honour of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, in Windsor, Britain, May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Phil Noble\nPreviously known as “The Three Tuns”, the public house takes on its new name just as Britain’s sixth-in-line to the throne prepares to marry his American actress fiancée Meghan Markle.\nWith a new sign, portrait of the prince and plenty of balloons and flag decorations, the pub is also serving a local royal wedding pale ale ahead of the big day.\nLandlady Kelly Carpenter said the name change had been planned for while but workers had scrambled to get everything ready before Saturday. “We all love (Prince Harry),” she said. “He’s one of our favourites. He’s very normal.” Reporting by Ilze Filks; Editing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Alison Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:43:13.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
