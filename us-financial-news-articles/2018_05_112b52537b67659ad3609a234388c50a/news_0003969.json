Additionally, gains on foreign currency transactions had a favorable impact of $.1 million on pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to a $.2 million favorable impact for the same period in 2017.\nRob Ruhlman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"The first quarter of 2018 marked our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. Leveraging our global manufacturing infrastructure allowed us to expand our profit margins during this period. Raw material cost increases, competitive pricing and an uncertain tariff picture point to a challenging future. We believe our goal of consistent, profitable growth is best served through our ongoing concentration on high-quality products and focused customer service.\"\nFounded in 1947, Preformed Line Products is an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for energy, communications and broadband network companies.\nPreformed's world headquarters are in Cleveland, Ohio, and the Company operates two domestic manufacturing centers located in Rogers, Arkansas, and Albemarle, North Carolina.
