REUTERS/Tuomas Forsell/File Photo Antti Rinne, the head of the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, said it was “very difficult to imagine that we would go into a government with the Finns Party,” in a meeting with reporters.\nFinance Minister Petteri Orpo told the same event there had been no change in policy since his co-ruling National Coalition Party (NCP) and Prime Minister Juha Sipila’s Centre Party threw the Finns Party out of government last year because of its new hardline anti-immigration chairman.\nThe Finns Party - which was a rising force in Finnish politics as recently as 2015 with the clout to complicate euro zone bailout talks four years earlier - has split into two since it left government and has seen its support level off.\nThere was no immediate reaction from the party on Wednesday.\nFinns Party leader Jussi Halla-aho has said he wants Finland to cut immigration and leave the European Union. He has proposed sanctions against organizations that rescue refugees and immigrants from the Mediterranean, saying they only encourage more migrants.\nIn the latest opinion poll by Helsingin Sanomat daily, the Social Democrats ranked the most popular party with a support of 21.2 percent. NCP came in second with 20.5 percent.\nThe Finns Party was the sixth biggest with a support of 7.7 percent. The moderately nationalist Blue Reform group, which split away from the Finns last year and kept its government seat, has a support of just 1.7 percent.\nPrime Minister Sipila’s Centre party had a poll support of 15.7 percent.\nThe national election takes place in April 2019. Finland has a long tradition of majority governments and the next government will likely include two of the three biggest parties\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:43:55.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
