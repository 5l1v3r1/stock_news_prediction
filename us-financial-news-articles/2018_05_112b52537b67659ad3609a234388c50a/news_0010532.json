A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information is contained in the attached tables.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, on a fully retrospective basis. Adoption of the standard did not have a significant impact on the previously reported revenue or net income. The Company’s re-cast financial statements for 2017 are included in the accompanying financial schedules.\nUnrestricted cash and net investments decreased to $76.6 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $86.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The net decrease reflects the repurchase of 300,000 shares of Control4 stock on the open market for $7.4 million. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, the company generated net positive cash flows from operations of $0.5 million and paid $3.6 million for taxes in lieu of issuing an additional 146,359 shares of stock related to the net settlement of restricted stock units that vested during the quarter.\n“We’ve started 2018 with solid business performance, and we continue to see clear opportunities to deliver more fantastic connected-experiences to homeowners, families, and businesses,” said Martin Plaehn, chairman and chief executive officer of Control4. “We’re excited about our portfolio of Control4, Pakedge, and Triad branded products and we have great confidence in the global team -- serving our world-wide channel and end-customers and building the next wave of connected-home solutions.”\nCommenting on the company’s financial results, Mark Novakovich, chief financial officer of Control4, added: “We delivered strong revenue growth and profitability to start the year resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 9.8% in the first quarter of 2018, up 78% from the 5.5% operating margin achieved in the first quarter of 2017. We intend to continue driving revenue growth and improving operating leverage to enhance long-term shareholder value.”\nQ2 and 2018 Guidance\nControl4 expects revenue in the second quarter of 2018 to be between $67.0 million and $69.0 million. Control4 expects non-GAAP Net Income for the second quarter of 2018 to be between $8.3 million and $9.3 million and based on an expected 27.5 million weighted average shares outstanding (diluted), to be between $0.30 and $0.34 per diluted share. Control4 expects revenue for the full year 2018 to be between $271 million and $275 million. Control4 expects Non-GAAP Net Income to be between $34.8 million and $36.8 million and based on an expected 27.7 million weighted average shares outstanding (diluted), to be between $1.26 and $1.33 per diluted share.\nControl4 does not provide forward guidance on GAAP Net Income because certain non-GAAP adjustments are inherently difficult to forecast, whereas others relate to the amortization or expensing of items tied to historical events. The following table highlights our estimates of non-GAAP stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets reflected in our non-GAAP net income guidance for the second quarter of 2018:\nExpense ($ mm) 2Q 2018 Stock-based compensation expense 3.0 Amortization of intangible assets 1.3 Total 4.3 Additional Financial and Operational Metrics\nRevenue ($ mm) 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2017 North America Core Revenue 45.7 51.8 39.2 International Core Revenue 12.8 14.6 10.5 Other Revenue 1\n0.6 1.7 0.5 Total Revenue 59.1 68.1 50.2 1 Primarily consists of Hospitality Revenue\n1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2017 Dealer Adds 2 North America 83 75 103 International 52 57 68 Total Dealer Adds 135 132 171 Active Dealers 2, 3 North America 3,108 3,057 2,959 International 1,195 1,169 1,090 Total Active Dealers 4,303 4,226 4,049 Total Dealers 2 North America 3,215 3,174 3,039 International 1,358 1,315 1,199 Total Dealers 4,573 4,489 4,238 Controller Shipments 23,413 30,083 21,341 2 These dealer figures only include dealers authorized to sell and install the full Control4 line of products and exclude approximately 1,090 active dealers that are currently authorized to sell only the Pakedge and or Triad brand of products.\n3 We define an active, authorized dealer (“active dealer”) as one that has placed an order with us in the trailing 12-month period.\nConference Call\nOn May 3, 2018, Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ: CTRL) will host an investor conference call and will webcast the event beginning at 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release are These are made as of the date they were first issued, and were based on the then-current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections, as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond Control4’s control. Control4’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks detailed in Control4’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as subsequent reports and documents filed Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The included in this press release represent Control4’s views as of the date of this press release. The company anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its views to change. Control4 has no intention and undertakes no obligation to update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. These should not be relied upon as representing Control4’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nControl4’s stated results include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin percentage, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating income percentage, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and acquisition-related costs. We further exclude expenses related to executive severance and litigation settlements from non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income.\nManagement believes that it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense because the amount of such expense in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of the business operations.\nThe company has recently completed acquisitions that resulted in operating expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred. Management has provided supplementary non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude acquisition-related expense items, to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to historical operations, forward-looking guidance and the financial results of less acquisitive peer companies. Management considers these types of costs and adjustments, to a great extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of the company’s control. Furthermore, the company does not consider these acquisition-related costs and adjustments to be related to the organic continuing operations of the acquired businesses and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets. In addition, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions. By excluding acquisition-related costs and adjustments from the non-GAAP measures, management is better able to evaluate the ability to utilize its existing assets and estimate the long-term value that acquired assets will generate. The company believes that providing a supplemental non-GAAP measure which excludes these items allows management and investors to consider the ongoing operations of the business both with, and without, such expenses.\nThese acquisition-related costs are included in the following categories: (i) professional service fees, recorded in operating expenses, which include third-party costs related to the acquisition, and legal and other professional service fees associated with diligence, entity formation and corporate structuring, disputes and regulatory matters related to acquired entities; (ii) transition and integration costs, recorded in operating expenses, which include retention payments, transitional employee costs, earn-out payments treated as compensation expense, as well as the costs of integration-related services provided by third parties; and (iii) acquisition-related adjustments which include adjustments to acquisition-related items such as being required to record acquired inventory at its fair value, resulting in a step-up in the inventory value, and having to reverse part of our valuation allowance in order to offset the deferred tax liability that was recorded based on differences between the book and tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The step-up in inventory is recorded through cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin. Although these expenses are not recurring with respect to past acquisitions, the company will generally incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions.\nThe company excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP measures. These amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. Providing a supplemental measure which excludes these charges allows management and investors to evaluate results “as-if” the acquired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired. Although the company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.\nFurthermore, we believe it is useful to exclude expenses related to litigation settlements and executive severance because of the variable and unpredictable nature of these expenses which are not indicative of past or future operating performance. We believe that past and future periods are more comparable if we exclude those expenses.\nManagement believes these adjustments provide useful comparative information to investors. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding the operating results. The non-GAAP results should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Management urges investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.\nSource: Control4\nCONTROL4 CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share data)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited) Assets Current
