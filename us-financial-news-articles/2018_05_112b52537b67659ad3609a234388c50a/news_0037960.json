Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nU.S. lawmakers have rejected any effort to ease restrictions on ZTE. The firm’s logo is shown on a building in Shanghai this month. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Good morning. President Donald Trump continued tweeting about the U.S. export-controls ban on ZTE Corp., likely entrenching him further in a law-enforcement matter, which sanctions experts say could give companies a blueprint for wriggling out of potential penalties.\nMr. Trump tweeted Wednesday that despite his earlier request for the Commerce Department to consider reversing the ban, “nothing has happened,” except for his linkage of the case to a larger trade deal with China. His tweets contradicted messages from his aides .\nLawmakers have rejected any effort to ease restrictions on ZTE, which was slapped with a seven-year ban on receiving U.S. components after officials found it failed to comply with a settlement resolving evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The ban led the company to halt major operations .\nMr. Trump’s messages on Twitter raise the issue of the uncertainty that could shroud future enforcement actions related to sanctions violations, experts said.\n“The president has taken a position on a sanctions-enforcement matter, and one that…seems to be contradictory to the position the agency had taken,” said Peter Kucik, an attorney with Ferrari & Associates PC, a boutique sanctions-focused law firm.\nCompanies could appeal directly to the White House seeking a positive outcome, Mr. Kucik said. “It’s a new form of leverage,” he said.\nThere could be a potential argument for using the ZTE ban to advance U.S. national-security interests regarding China, said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the center for energy policy at Columbia University’s School of International Public Affairs. But Mr. Trump so far has failed to get concessions from Beijing, said Mr. Nephew, who also wrote the book “The Art of Sanctions.”\n“That is not how this is supposed to work,” Mr. Nephew said.\nMoreover, Mr. Nephew said, linking the ZTE case to larger trade talks muddles Mr. Trump’s message around his exit from the Iran nuclear deal, because companies will cite his tweets when considering how the U.S. will enforce its renewed sanctions against Tehran.\n“They [companies] are absolutely looking at this case,” said Mr. Nephew.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nCrisis of the week: Air France-KLM.
