Income from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $0.6 million compared with $0.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.5 million or 500%. Net income per basic share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $0.29 and $0.03 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net income per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $0.28 and $0.03 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nData Storage segment revenues were $1.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $0.7 million for the same period last year, an increase of $0.9 million or 128.6%, primarily due to the increased product development service revenue received from our partnership with Sony Imaging Products & Solutions for the development of an enterprise class optical disk archive library. Power supply segment revenues were $1.3 million for the quarter, compared with $1.7 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.4 million, or (23.5)%, due to delayed order deliveries caused by a global electronic component shortage.\nGross margin was 48.3% of revenues or $1.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase from the gross margin of 37.5% of revenues or $0.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $0.8 million or 27.6% of revenues, and $0.8 million, or 33.3% of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nSteven N. Bronson, Chief Executive Officer and President of Qualstar, said, “We are delighted with our solid financial results for the first quarter of 2018. We benefited from an increase in revenues from data hardware sales and product development services, which revenues were partially offset by a decline in power supply revenues caused by component shortages. We expect our product development services revenues and income to vary in future periods based upon the timing of projects and our completion of project milestones. We continue to gain traction in expanding our data storage partners and momentum in the custom power supply space.” Mr. Bronson added, “We continue to pursue new product opportunities and acquisitions.”\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $1.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to $5.3 million compared to $3.8 million at March 31, 2017.\nAbout Qualstar Corporation\nQualstar, founded in 1984, is a diversified electronics manufacturer specializing in data storage and power supplies.
