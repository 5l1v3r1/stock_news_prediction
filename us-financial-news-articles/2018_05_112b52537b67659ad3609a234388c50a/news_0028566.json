It was a good night. I slept well last night.”\nAlden Ehrenreich, 28, stepped into the role of cowboy smuggler Han Solo, made famous by Harrison Ford in the original “Star Wars” trilogy that began in 1977. Ehrenreich plays a younger Solo just beginning his pilot training and seeking his own spaceship when he becomes involved in a dangerous mission in the galaxy far, far away.\n“Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke, who portrays Solo’s childhood friend Qi’ra, said the change of directors produced less drama than people may think.\n“Something that on paper sounds horrific was not in reality at all for someone who was in it and experienced and was living through it,” Clarke said. “Everyone who handled it was seamless and graceful.”\nFans around the world have debated how Ehrenreich, little known beyond a well-received performance in quirky 2016 comedy “Hail, Caesar,” would handle one of cinema’s most loved characters.\nEhrenreich confirmed he had signed a contract to play Solo in three movies and said he was anxious to step into the role again in future installments.\n“By the end of the movie, he’s more like the guy we know, and that’s fun,” Ehrenreich said.
