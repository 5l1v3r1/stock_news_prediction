However, it rejects all claims that it has abused its market position.\n“Being successful is not a crime. Abusing your success is a crime. None of the studies have found Safaricom abusing its dominance,” chief financial officer Sateesh Kamath told Reuters after a results briefing.\nProfit before interest and taxes should rise 7-12 percent to 85-89 billion shillings in the year to April 2019 as a bounce in economic growth lifts demand for financial services and mobile internet usage, Kamath said.\nThe two revenue streams contributed 73 percent of the company’s 10 percent growth in last year’s service revenue.\nFixed data - provision of internet through fiber lines to homes - had grown faster than expected.\nRevenue from the fixed internet business surged 27 percent to 6.67 billion shillings ($66 million) as the number of connected homes nearly tripled to 140,000, Kamath said.\nCEO Bob Collymore, who has been on medical leave since October, addressed the briefing in Nairobi by video conference and said his treatment would continue for a number of weeks.\nKamath said Collymore had helped in the running of the company from his sick bed.\n“When the physical condition and the doctors allow, he jumps into calls with us, he guides us. When we are in London we go and meet him, take advice,” he said. $1 = 100.55 Kenyan shillings Editing by Ed Cropley and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T10:49:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
