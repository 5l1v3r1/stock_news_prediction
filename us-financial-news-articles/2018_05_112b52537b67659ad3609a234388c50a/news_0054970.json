The FIA has to clarify these unanswered questions by the race in Monte Carlo,” the Austrian told Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff and Red Bull’s Christian Horner were asked about the rumors in a scheduled news conference after Thursday’s first practice in Monaco.\n“We have legality topics come up regularly. Some are more controversial but it’s the daily business of the FIA to check what the teams do,” said Wolff.\n“It is the obligation of the teams to comply with the regulations and this is an ongoing process...and as far as I understand this is a process that’s taking place as we speak and we will see what the outcome is.”\nHorner expressed confidence in the FIA’s ability to “measure, administer and look at the car that’s presented for scrutineering and during a grand prix weekend.”\nFerrari’s four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, who is 17 points behind Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton after five races but won in Monaco last year, said such speculation was to be expected.\n“It’s normal that every now and then you have something popping up,” he told reporters. “This time for us...but in four weeks’ time it will be for someone else.\n“Ultimately I think it’s the FIA’s job to look after it and I think we trust them as much as the other teams trust them.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:15:28.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
