Nearly two-thirds expect the U.S. government to increase its scrutiny of cross-border mergers and acquisitions while two-thirds forecast more restrictive immigration policies.\nA number of high-profile deals have been scuttled amid heightened national security concerns by the U.S. government included the failed hostile takeover of chip maker Qualcomm Inc. by Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd. and the attempted acquisition of payments provider MoneyGram International Inc. by China’s Ant Financial Services Group.\nOver 40% of CFOs consider such policies as a hindrance for investment, the study said.\nThe researchers interviewed 497 chief financial officers in February and March of this year. Over 100 of those were finance chiefs at U.S.-based firms, with the remainder coming from 29 other countries, including China, Germany and Canada. Those based in the U.S. were the most optimistic about the economic outlook.\nDespite tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, over 60% of both Asia Pacific and North American CFOs said the U.S. was getting more attractive for foreign businesses. In Europe, slightly less than half of finance chiefs shared this view.\nThe companies surveyed for the report represent various industries including manufacturing, automotive, consumer retail and banking. Around a quarter of companies generated $100 million to $500 million in annual revenue, while another quarter had revenues of between $500 million to $3 billion. Nearly 15% of companies generated more than $5 billion in annual revenue.\nShare this: ECONOMIC OUTLOOK PROTECTIONISM U.S. TAX OVERHAUL Previous The Morning Ledger: U.S. Weighs Curbs on Chinese Telecom Firms Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Talent Shortages Create Risk of Missed Opportunities: CFO Signals Anticipating higher investment post tax reform, North American CFOs voiced very strong internal concerns about driving initiatives and securing the talent they need, according to Deloitte’s first-quarter 2018 CFO Signals™ survey. Talent concerns have topped CFOs’ list of internal risks for many quarters, and their focus on talent acquisition, quality, and retention seems to have intensified. Despite talent constraints, 69% of the 155 CFOs responding to the survey say now is a good time to be taking greater risk—up from 63% in Q4 2017, and a new survey high.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
