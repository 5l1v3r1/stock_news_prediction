(Corporate Services) operations generated $0.45 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018, which was $0.07 per share higher than the first quarter of 2017. The primary drivers of higher EPS were $0.07 per share higher margins resulting from Interstate Power and Light Company's (IPL) interim retail electric base rate increase implemented in April 2017, and higher retail electric and gas sales due to colder temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense.\nNon-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy's Non-utility and Parent operations generated $0.04 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018, which was an improvement of $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2017. The primary driver of higher EPS is higher equity income from the wind farm in Oklahoma due to accelerated earnings as a result of Tax Reform, which is expected to reverse over time.\nDetails regarding GAAP EPS from continuing operations variances between the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 for Alliant Energy are as follows:\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nVariance\nUtilities and Corporate Services:\nHigher margins primarily from earning on increasing rate base\n$0.09\nEstimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales\n$0.01\n($0.04)\n0.05\nHigher depreciation expense\n(0.04)\nOther\n(0.03)\nTotal Utilities and Corporate Services\n$0.07\nNon-utility and Parent:\nOther (primarily due to the timing of the impacts of Tax Reform)\n$0.02\nTotal Non-utility and Parent\n$0.02\nHigher margins primarily from earning on increasing rate base - In April 2017, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers. The request was based on a 2016 historical Test Year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. An interim retail electric rate increase of $102 million, on an annual basis, was implemented effective April 13, 2017. IPL recognized $23 million, or $0.07 per share, of higher electric revenues in the first quarter of 2018 due to the interim retail electric rate increase.\nIn December 2016, Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL) received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing WPL to implement a retail electric rate increase effective January 1, 2017 followed by a freeze of such rates through the end of 2018. To reflect the higher margins in 2018, primarily from earning on increasing rate base, the order lowered the amortization of amounts that WPL previously over-recovered from its customers for electric transmission cost recovery beginning in January 2018. WPL recognized $0.02 per share of higher electric margins in the first quarter of 2018 due to lower transmission cost recovery amortization.\nTax Reform Impacts - Alliant Energy's Non-utility wind farm holding generated higher earnings in the first quarter of 2018 due to an acceleration of earnings as a result of Tax Reform which is expected to reverse over time.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nAlliant Energy is reaffirming its EPS guidance for 2018 as follows:\nUtilities and Corporate Services\n$1.92 - $2.02\nATC Holdings\n0.12 - 0.14\nNon-utility and Parent\n0.00 - 0.02\nAlliant Energy Consolidated\n$2.04 - $2.18\nDrivers for Alliant Energy's 2018 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to:\nAbility of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return Stable economy and resulting implications on utility sales Normal temperatures for the remainder of the year in its utility service territories Continuing cost controls Execution of IPL's and WPL's capital expenditure and financing plans Regulatory treatment of Tax Reform benefits from utility operations Consolidated effective tax rate of 12%\nThe 2018 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, further impacts from anticipated changes to ATC LLC's authorized return on equity, future changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.\nEarnings Conference Call\nA conference call to review the first quarter 2018 results is scheduled for Thursday, May 3rd at 9:00 a.m. central time.

Similarly, statements that describe future financial performance or plans or strategies are forward-looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements.

the direct or indirect effects resulting from breakdown or failure of equipment in the operation of electric and gas distribution systems, such as mechanical problems and explosions or fires, and compliance with electric and gas transmission and distribution safety regulations; issues related to the availability and operations of EGUs, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency, operator error, employee safety, transmission constraints, compliance with mandatory reliability standards and risks related to recovery of resulting incremental costs through rates; impacts that storms or natural disasters in IPL's and WPL's service territories may have on their operations and recovery of costs associated with restoration activities; any material post-closing adjustments related to any past asset divestitures, including the sales of IPL's Minnesota electric and natural gas assets, and Whiting Petroleum Corporation, which could result from, among other things, indemnification agreements, warranties, parental guarantees or litigation; Alliant Energy's ability to sustain its dividend payout ratio goal; changes to costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of pension and OPEB plans due to the market value of the assets that fund the plans, economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics;
