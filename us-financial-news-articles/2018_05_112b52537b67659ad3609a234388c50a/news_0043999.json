Grand China Air, in turn, is controlled by Hainanâ€™s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).\nThis meant that the airline was currently controlled by the Hainan SASAC, it added. The firm, trading in whose shares have been suspended since January, also said it expects to apply for resumption in share trading by June 9.
