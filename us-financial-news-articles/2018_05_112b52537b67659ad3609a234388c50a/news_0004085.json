Susie Bartlett/The Wildlife Conservation Society/Handout via Reuters\nBartlett and colleagues spent days working in 100 Fahrenheit heat at a care facility in one of the tortoises natural habitats - the spiny forests on the island’s southwestern coast.\n“We got poked and scratched by spiny branches when crawling through to access the animals,” said Bartlett.\nSome have died but thousands of others are getting better. It is unlikely they will be released back into the wild anytime soon because they could be recaptured by poachers.\nThey are prized as delicacies in some parts of Asia, and as pets in other areas, Bartlett added.
