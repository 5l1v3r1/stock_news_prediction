But many Rohingya say their young people are being pushed into crime because they cannot legally work or, in many cases, get access to aid.\nThe 86 deaths occurred when police defended themselves in confrontations with suspected drug traffickers, said Mufti Mahmud Khan, a director of the police Rapid Action Battalion.\n“It’s their legal right to save themselves from the attack,” Mufti told Reuters.\nHuman rights activists are worried the Bangladesh campaign is taking a page from the Philippine drugs war, in which thousands of people have been killed in the past two years.\n“The Sheikh Hasina government says it is a protector of human rights, so it should reform its domestic record, set an example, instead of wishing to be compared to an abusive regime,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch.\nGanguly said the government “should heed concerns and allegations by families and activists that several of these deaths could be extrajudicial killings”.\nInterior minister Asaduzzaman Khan rejected the rights group’s allegations and denied that police had carried out any extra-judicial killings. He said dozens of police had been injured in anti-drug operations.\nThe opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said the anti-drugs drive was part of a campaign to intimidate it but Khan also rejected that, saying ruling party members would not be spared if found guilty of drug crimes.\n“We are determined to save our young generation from the curse of drugs,” he said.
