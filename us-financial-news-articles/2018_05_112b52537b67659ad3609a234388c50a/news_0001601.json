We achieved solid re-leasing spreads with good leasing volume and strong tenant sales growth\" said the Company's chairman and chief executive officer, Arthur Coppola. \"We remain excited about the leasing opportunities we see as the synergies between digitally native retailers on line sales and their appetite for great real estate become more clear as is evidenced by their appetite for off line stores.\"\nFinancing Activity:\nThe Company closed on a $450 million, 12-year fixed rate loan on the recently expanded and renovated Broadway Plaza. The interest rate is 4.18%. The Company has less than $10 million of loan maturities for the balance of 2018.\nJoint Ventures:\nOn March 1, 2018 the Company formed a joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP) to work together to transform Westside Pavilion into creative office space.

As a result, the Company has included in interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (i) a charge of $4,382 to adjust the fair value of the financing arrangement obligation during the period, (ii) distributions of $2,002 to its partner representing the partner's share of net income and (iii) distributions of $1,638 to its partner in excess of the partner's share of net income.\n(b)\nThe Macerich Partnership, L.P. (the \"Operating Partnership\" or the \"OP\") has operating partnership units (\"OP units\"). OP units can be converted into shares of Company common stock. Conversion of the OP units not owned by the Company has been assumed for purposes of calculating FFO per share and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The computation of average shares for FFO - diluted includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans, stock warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes conversion of MACWH, LP preferred and common units to the extent they are dilutive to the calculation.\n(c)\nThe Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. As a result of changes in accounting standards effective January 1, 2018 (ASC 606), the Company began treating its joint venture in Chandler Freehold as a financing arrangement for accounting purposes. In connection with this treatment, the Company recognizes financing expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the financing arrangement, (ii) any payments to such joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to such joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. The Company excludes from its definition of FFO the noted expenses related to the changes in fair value and for the payments to such joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. Although the NAREIT definition of FFO predates this guidance for accounting for financing arrangements, the Company believes that excluding the noted expenses resulting from the financing arrangement is consistent with the key objective of FFO as a performance measure and it allows the Company's currrent FFO to be comparable with the Company's FFO from prior quarters. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.\nFFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other real estate investement trusts (\"REITs\"). The Company believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.\nThe Company further believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.\nTHE MACERICH COMPANY\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nReconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to the Company to FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders - basic and diluted (c):\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31,\nUnaudited\n2018\n2017\nNet (loss) income attributable to the Company\n($33,573)\n$69,243\nAdjustments to reconcile net (loss) income attributable to the Company to FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders - basic and diluted:\nNoncontrolling interests in the OP\n(2,450)\n5,108\nLoss (gain) on sale or write down of consolidated assets, net\n37,512\n(49,565)\nAdd: gain on undepreciated asset sales from consolidated assets\n807\n-\nLoss on write-down of consolidated non-real estate assets\n-\n(10,138)\nNoncontrolling interests share of gain on sale or write-down of consolidated joint ventures\n590\n-\nLoss (gain) on sale or write down of assets from unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata), net\n157\n(2,269)\nAdd: (loss) gain on sales or write down of undepreciated assets from unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata), net\n(2,085)\n660\nDepreciation and amortization on consolidated assets\n79,937\n83,073\nLess depreciation and amortization allocable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures\n(3,641)\n(3,893)\nDepreciation and amortization on unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)\n43,584\n44,765\nLess: depreciation on personal property\n(3,345)\n(3,381)\nFinancing expense in connection with the adoption of ASC 606 (Chandler Freehold)\n6,020\n-\nFFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders - basic and diluted\n$ 123,513\n$ 133,603\nReconciliation of EPS to FFO per diluted share (c):\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31,\nUnaudited\n2018\n2017\nEPS - diluted\n($0.24)\n$0.48\nPer share impact of depreciation and amortization of real estate\n0.77\n0.78\nPer share impact of loss (gain) on sale or write down of assets, net\n0.25\n(0.39)\nPer share impact of financing expense in connection with the adoption of ASC 606 (Chandler Freehold)\n0.04\n-\nFFO per share - diluted\n$0.82\n$0.87\nTHE MACERICH COMPANY\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nReconciliation of Net (loss) income attributable to the Company to Adjusted EBITDA:\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31,\nUnaudited\n2018\n2017\nNet (loss) income attributable to the Company\n($33,573)\n$69,243\nInterest expense - consolidated assets\n52,635\n41,301\nInterest expense - unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)\n25,433\n25,306\nDepreciation and amortization - consolidated assets\n79,937\n83,073\nDepreciation and amortization - unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)\n43,584\n44,765\nNoncontrolling interests in the OP\n(2,450)\n5,108\nLess: Interest expense and depreciation and amortization allocable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures\n(8,781)\n(6,212)\n(Gain) loss on sale or write down of assets, net - consolidated assets\n37,512\n(49,565)\nLoss (gain) on sale or write down of assets, net - unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)\n157\n(2,269)\nAdd: Noncontrolling interests share of gain on sale or write down of consolidated joint ventures, net\n590\n-\nIncome tax benefit\n(2,949)\n(3,484)\nDistributions on preferred units\n99\n96\nAdjusted EBITDA (d)\n$192,194\n$207,362\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") and to NOI - Same Centers:\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31,\nUnaudited\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted EBITDA (d)\n$192,194\n$207,362\nREIT general and administrative expenses\n8,019\n8,463\nManagement Companies' revenues\n(10,542)\n(11,896)\nManagement Companies' operating expenses\n38,323\n28,517\nStraight-line and above/below market adjustments\n(8,172)\n(7,414)\nNOI - All Centers\n219,822\n225,032\nNOI of non-Same Centers\n(7,283)\n(12,646)\nNOI - Same Centers (e)\n$212,539\n$212,386\n(d)\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, noncontrolling interests in the OP, extraordinary items, loss (gain) on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt and preferred dividends and includes joint ventures at their pro rata share. Management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps investors understand the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. The Company also cautions that Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.\n(e)\nThe Company presents Same Center NOI because the Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate the operating performance of comparable centers. Same Center NOI is calculated using total Adjusted EBITDA and eliminating the impact of the management companies' revenues and operating expenses, the Company's general and administrative expenses and the straight-line and above/below market adjustments to minimum rents and subtracting out NOI from non-Same Centers.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/macerich-announces-quarterly-results-300641530.html\nSOURCE The Macerich Company", "external_links": ["http://www.macerich.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/macerich-announces-quarterly-results-300641530.html"], "published": "2018-05-03T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T01:52:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
