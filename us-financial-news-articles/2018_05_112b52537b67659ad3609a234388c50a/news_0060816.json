(RES) and Vestas, developed the project. Once operational, all electric energy, capacity and other attributes generated by the facility will be sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement to Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation (AECC).\n\"We are proud to announce our tenth wind project as we continue to build the future of energy,\" said Southern Power President and CEO Mark Lantrip. \"Wildhorse Mountain is a great project for Southern Power's growing footprint and a shining example of our collaborative partnership with RES. Our long-time partner Vestas was also a key player in delivering on this project. We look forward to its completion and operation.\"\nThe project is expected to consist of 29 Vestas wind turbines. RES will provide the balance of plant construction of the facility, and Vestas will provide long-term maintenance of the turbines through a 20-year service agreement.\nWildhorse Mountain is expected to achieve commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2019. AECC intends to sell the renewable energy credits associated with the electricity produced by Wildhorse Mountain.
