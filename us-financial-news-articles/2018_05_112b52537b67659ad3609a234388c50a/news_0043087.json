It said in a New York court filing that its assets totaled $100,001 to $500,000. Its liabilities are between $1 million and $10 million and it has between one and 49 creditors.\nThe filing is signed by Jennifer and Rebekah, sisters who are majority shareholders of Cambridge Analytica. The Mercer family is led by billionaire Robert Mercer, a Republican mega-donor with close ties to Trump. He sold his personal stake in the pro-Trump website Breitbart News to his daughters in late 2017.\nCambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for possible links to the federal probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 president election and fallen into the crosshairs of special counsel Robert Mueller.\nCambridge Analytica filed papers to begin insolvency proceedings in the U.K. earlier this month. At the time, it blamed \"unfairly negative media coverage\" and said it had been \"vilified\" for actions it said were both legal and widely accepted as part of online advertising.\nCambridge Analytica has insisted that none of the Facebook data it acquired from an academic researcher was used in the Trump campaign. The company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in two days of hearings. Facebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\nCambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix in March pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News. Channel 4 News broadcast clips that showed Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.\nActing CEO Alexander Tayler also stepped down in April and returned to his previous post as chief data officer.\nOn Thursday British lawmakers investigating the use of Facebook users' data in political campaigns said that Nix accepted a summons to appear before Parliament's media committee. He will appear on June 6.\nSeparately, it was announced that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with leaders of the European Parliament in a closed-door meeting Tuesday about the data protection scandal that has engulfed his company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:22:46.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
