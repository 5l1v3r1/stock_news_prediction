The fund will focus on Asia, and China more specifically, but will also research potential targets in Europe and the United States.\n“We will not hold back from exposing dishonest or complacent companies that flout their responsibilities,” Aandahl said in a press release, adding that he expected Blue Orca’s first short-selling idea would target a Hong Kong stock soon.\nAandahl is due to appear at the city’s now-annual Sohn Conference Hong Kong on May 30, where investors take turns to pitch a series of long and short ideas.\nMuch of Glaucus’s work since its inception in 2011 has focused on shorting Chinese companies such as Hong Kong-listed China Metal Recycling, which claimed to be China’s largest scrap metal recycler. Glaucus questioned its reported accounts in 2013. Within six months, the city’s regulator had begun to wind up the company.\nAandahl and his Glaucus co-founder, Matthew Wiechert, featured prominently in the 2018 documentary, The China Hustle, which tracks the efforts of a group of investors to expose fraud in China.\nReporting by Jennifer Hughes Editing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:33:18.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
