But that’s okay... will be a good learning experience for our young blokes and our experienced guys will help navigate that landscape.”\nLanger, who replaced Darren Lehmann after the former coach quit following the scandal, had previously said the team would need to earn back the respect of the cricketing world, which could take time. He reiterated that on Saturday.\n“We have to aim to be number one in professionalism, number one in honesty, number one in humility,” Langer said.\n“It doesn’t matter how much money, how many games, how many runs you made, if you are not a good bloke that is what people remember.\n“So if we behave well on and off the field, then hopefully we’ll earn some respect back and earn some trust back.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T11:24:37.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
