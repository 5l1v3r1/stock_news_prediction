This change is mainly due to global developments.”\nGROWTH “The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, although growth is still expected to outperform recent year outcome. Consumption expenditure by households is expected to be the main driver of growth going forward.\n“The growth forecast has improved moderately, mainly for 2019, but remains too low to make serious inroads into the unemployment rate.\n“The domestic economic growth outlook has improved moderately amid rising business and consumer confidence, despite a disappointing first-quarter performance in a number of key sectors.”\nRAND “In the near term the rand is expected to remain volatile. The resurgent U.S. dollar and higher U.S. long-bond yields have led to sharper lower capital flows to emerging markets ... coupled with persistently rising international oil prices, have contributed to the reversal of some of the recent rand strength, titling the balance of risks to the domestic inflation outlook to the upside.” (Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana and Alexander Winning Editing by James Macharia)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:17:09.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
