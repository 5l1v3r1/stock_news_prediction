That month, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a DHS agency, began accepting applications.\nA USCIS spokesman said on Friday that the agency “has received approximately 12 applications for the IE programme, but has not yet issued any final decisions.”\nThis month NVCA filed a motion in federal court demanding to know whether USCIS “has adopted any policies or practices” that circumvent the December court ruling. It claimed that DHS “failed to take action” on the applications.\nJeff Farrah, NVCA’s vice president of government affairs, said the group would continue to pursue that motion, regardless of the DHS decision.
