Chinnappa/File photo\nKarnataka, now ruled by the Congress party, is home to India’s Silicon Valley capital of Bengaluru. It is the first big state electing an assembly this year and will be followed by three more.\nModi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was leading in 76 seats in the elections to the 225-seat assembly in Karnataka, versus 74 for Congress, the Times Now news channel said. Another channel, NDTV, showed the BJP leading in 62 seats and Congress in 63.\nInvestors are watching the contest closely as they worry a loss for Modi would force him to double down on populist measures, such as extending farm loan waivers a year before the 2019 elections.\nIf Modi failed to capture the state, that would re-energise Congress under Rahul Gandhi, the fifth-generation scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that is trying to exploit dissatisfaction over a lack of jobs for young people and rising fuel prices.\nBoth Gandhi and Modi addressed rallies across the state to drum up support.
