Zuckerberg apologized for the mistakes his company made and testified before the U.S. lawmakers.\nThe company, however, regained much of its lost market value after it reported a surprisingly strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users when it announced quarterly results on April 25.\nShares of the company were up 0.4 percent at $187.65 in premarket trading on Monday.\n(This version of the story corrects share price in last paragraph.)
