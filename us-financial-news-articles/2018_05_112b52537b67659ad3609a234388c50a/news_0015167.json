We will strengthen the government’s authority and increase the public’s faith in the court,” Education Minister Naftali Bennett of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party wrote on Twitter, announcing the committee’s approval.\nBut Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who heads another coalition partner, Kulanu, said in a statement condemning the move that his centrist party “will not allow extremists to set Israel’s agenda”. Kahlon was not present for the committee vote.\nComprised of 15 judges, the Supreme Court is widely seen in Israel as a liberal bastion, and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked has been pushing for a bench more representative of conservative Israelis.\nIts members are appointed by a selection committee that includes Shaked, three Supreme Court justices and representatives of the Bar Association.\nIn recent years, the court has angered the right-wing by striking down a law that allowed indefinite detention of African migrants who entered the country illegally and cancelling legislation exempting Jewish religious seminary students from military service.\nThe court also has been a thorn in the side of Israel’s settlement movement in the occupied West Bank, hearing petitions that have led to the demolition of outposts and homes built without government sanction on land Palestinians seek for a state.\nAmit Segal, a political analyst for Israel’s Channel Two television, said Kahlon’s opposition meant that “the law is headed for a state funeral” in parliament.
