We have the Kisiljevo vampire,” notary and folklorist Mirko Bogicic said, speaking of his hopes for eventually building a vampire themed village, with period costumes and homes.\nBogicic said Blagojevic came back from the dead to torment his family and neighbors, lurking near houses to demand food or shoes and attacking and strangling his victims.\nIn a region where superstitions and similar stories are abundant, Bogicic says the difference in Kisiljevo is that the story was documented at the time by a representative of the then Habsburg monarchy, Frombald.\nAccording to a story published a Vienese newspaper of the time, terrified villagers demanded an investigation which led to the opening of Blagojevic’s grave.\n“They found the body intact, with his beard and nails visibly grown ... they quickly prepared a hawthorne stake and he was stabbed with it ...,” Bogicic said, holding a photocopy of the newspaper.\n“The he (Frombald) ... noted that those wounds, and mouth and ears all bled fresh, red blood.”\nNearly three centuries later, Kisiljevo, the nearby lakeside resort Srebrno Jezero and the small riverside town of Veliko Gradiste are looking to cash in.\nThey hope the legend will attract tourists from the Danube cruises, some of which already stop in Veliko Gradiste.
