It is Britain’s biggest space company and the majority owner of SSTL, a Surrey, England-based company which makes satellites for the Galileo project.\nBut the UK arm of Airbus and other British companies are now being locked out of future work on Galileo ahead of Britain’s exit from the EU in 2019.\nPaynter said that as a result, Airbus’s latest bids would mean moving work out of the UK, where it has been operating the ground control system for the program for the last 10 years.\n“That is a condition of the tender process and effectively that means for Airbus to bid and win that work we will have to novate (move) all that work from the UK to France and Germany on day one of that contract,” he said.
