These fees were accrued in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), where such amounts are not contractually due under the terms of the investment advisory agreement for the respective periods. Also see discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income below. (B) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure — Adjusted Net Investment Income below for a description of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation from Net investment income to Adjusted net investment income, including on a weighted average per share basis. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. (C) Estimates of tax characterization made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax characterization of distributions for the full year. Estimates made on a quarterly basis are updated as of each interim reporting date. (D) Distributions coverage ratio is calculated by dividing (i) the sum of net investment income in excess of distributions at the end of the period and distributions to common stockholders from net investment income during the period by (ii) current period distributions from net investment income to common stockholders. NM = Not Meaningful\nHighlights for the Quarter: During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the following significant events occurred:\nPortfolio Activity : Invested $27.4 million in existing portfolio companies and received repayments and proceeds from sales of $13.2 million.\nFinancing Activity : Entered into equity distribution agreements (commonly referred to as “at-the-market” or “ATM” programs) to sell up to an aggregate offering amount of $35.0 million. In March 2018, we sold 127,412 shares of common stock at a weighted-average net price of $10.24 per share resulting in net proceeds of $1.3 million.\nDistributions and Dividends: Paid the following monthly cash distributions to common stockholders and dividends to preferred stockholders for each of January, February, and March 2018: $0.065 per common share, per month; $0.140625 per share, per month, for the Company’s 6.75% Series B Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (“Series B Term Preferred Stock”); $0.135417 per share, per month, for the Company’s 6.50% Series C Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (“Series C Term Preferred Stock”); and $0.13020833 per share to holders of our 6.25% Series D Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (“Series D Term Preferred Stock”).\nFourth Quarter Results : Net investment income for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $3.2 million, or $0.10 per weighted-average common share, and $7.5 million, or $0.23 per weighted-average common share, respectively. Net investment income decreased period over period primarily as a result of higher incentive fees, including $3.6 million, or $0.11 per weighted-average common share, of capital gains-based incentive fees accrued under U.S. GAAP, the payment of which is not contractually due under the terms of our investment advisory agreement, in the current period. Total investment income also decreased period over period as a result of lower interest and other income. Also see discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income below.\nNet asset value per common share as of March 31, 2018 increased to $10.85 compared to $10.37 as of December 31, 2017. The quarter over quarter increase was primarily due to $18.4 million, or $0.57 per common share, of net unrealized appreciation, principally resulting from improved performance and an increase in comparable multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain portfolio companies, partially offset by a decline in performance of certain other portfolio companies. The increase was also partially offset by the aforementioned accrual of $3.6 million, or $0.11 per common share, of capital gains-based incentive fees accrued under U.S. GAAP, the payment of which is not contractually due under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, in the current period.\nFiscal Year End Results: Net investment income for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $22.0 million, or $0.68 per weighted-average common share, and $22.4 million, or $0.74 per weighted-average common share, respectively. The slight year-over-year decrease in net investment income was primarily due to higher incentive fees, including $4.4 million, or $0.14 per weighted-average common share, of capital gains-based incentive fees accrued under U.S. GAAP, the payment of which is not contractually due under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, in the current period. The increase in incentive fees was partially offset by higher total investment income year-over-year due to an increase in both interest and other income. Also see discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income below.\nNet asset value per common share as of March 31, 2018 increased to $10.85 compared to $9.95 as of March 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $37.9 million, or $1.17 per common share, of net unrealized appreciation, principally resulting from improved performance and an increase in comparable multiples of certain portfolio companies, partially offset by a decline in performance of certain other portfolio companies and the reversal of previously recorded net unrealized appreciation related to exits. The increase was also partially offset by the aforementioned accrual of $4.4 million, or $0.13 per common share, of capital gains-based incentive fees under U.S. GAAP, the payment of which is not contractually due under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, in the current period.\nSubsequent Events: After March 31, 2018, the following significant events occurred:\nSignificant Investments : In April 2018, we invested $29.2 million in Bassett Creek Restoration, Inc. (d/b/a J.R. Johnson, LLC) (“Bassett Creek”) through a combination of secured first lien debt and preferred equity. Bassett Creek, headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is a leading provider of commercial restoration and renovation services to the Oregon and Southwest Washington region.\nFinancing Activity : Subsequent to March 31, 2018 and through May 8, 2018, we sold an additional 168,824 shares of our common stock under our ATM program at a weighted-average net price of $10.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of $1.8 million.\nDistributions and Dividends Declared : In April 2018, our Board of Directors declared the following increased monthly distributions to common stockholders, a supplemental distribution to common stockholders, and monthly dividends to holders of our three series of term preferred stock:\nRecord Date Payment Date Distribution per\nCommon Share Dividend per Share of\nSeries B Term Preferred Stock Dividend per Share of\nSeries C Term Preferred Stock Dividend per Share of\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock April 20, 2018 April 30, 2018 $ 0.067 $ 0.140625 $ 0.135417 $ 0.13020833 May 22, 2018 May 31, 2018 0.067 0.140625 0.135417 0.13020833 June 6, 2018 June 15, 2018 0.060 (A) — — — June 20, 2018 June 29, 2018 0.067 0.140625 0.135417 0.13020833 Total for the Quarter: $ 0.261 $ 0.421875 $ 0.406251 $ 0.39062499\n(A) Represents a supplemental distribution to common stockholders. Non-GAAP Financial Measure — Adjusted Net Investment Income: On a supplemental basis, the Company discloses Adjusted net investment income, including on a per share basis, which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). Adjusted net investment income represents net investment income, excluding the capital gains-based incentive fee. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. The Company’s investment advisory agreement provides that a capital gains-based incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized losses and unrealized depreciation on investments for such year. However, under U.S. GAAP, a capital gains-based incentive fee is accrued if realized capital gains and unrealized appreciation of investments exceed realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation of investments. Refer to Note 4 – Related Party Transactions in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. The Company believes that Adjusted net investment income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any capital gains-based incentive fee as net investment income does not include realized or unrealized investment activity associated with the capital gains-based incentive fee.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted net investment income for the periods presented:\nFor the quarter ended Amount Per Share\nAmount Amount Per Share\nAmount Net investment income $ 3,244 $ 0.10 $ 7,531 $ 0.23 Capital gains-based incentive fee 3,647 0.11 752 0.02 Adjusted net investment income $ 6,891 $ 0.21 $ 8,283 $ 0.25\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Amount Per Share\nAmount Amount Per Share\nAmount Net investment income $ 21,960 $ 0.68 $ 22,422 $ 0.74 Capital gains-based incentive fee 4,399 0.14 — — Adjusted net investment income $ 26,359 $ 0.82 $ 22,422 $ 0.74 Adjusted net investment income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as it is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, Adjusted net investment income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nConference Call: The Company will hold its earnings release conference call on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT.
