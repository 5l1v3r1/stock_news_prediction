REUTERS/Muyu Xu/Files The decision follows an announcement last month by the U.S. Commerce Department that it had opened an investigation to determine if certain steel wheels from China are dumped in the United States and whether producers in China are receiving unfair subsidies.\nThe department opened the investigation based on complaints by Accuride Corp and Maxion Wheels Akron LLC. The alleged dumping margins ranged from 12.1 percent to 231.7 percent, and U.S. imports of the products from China in 2017 were estimated to total $388 million, it said.\nThe ITC finding that U.S. industry is harmed by the imports keeps the investigation alive.\nReporting by Eric Walsh and Makini Brice; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:47:37.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
