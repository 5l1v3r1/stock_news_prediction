The index ended up 1 percent.\n\"Small caps present a cleaner play than large caps on two fundamental market drivers: lower corporate taxes and a stronger US economy,\" research firm DataTrek wrote in its morning briefing.\nMacy's Inc shares advanced 10.8 percent after the department store operator reported results that beat analyst estimates and the company raised its profit outlook.\nThe results also boosted shares of rival department stores J.C. Penney Co Inc, Kohl's Corp, Nordstrom Inc and Target Corp. The S&P 500 Department Store index gained 5.2 percent, its largest daily jump in nearly six months.\n\"I think corporate earnings have been remarkably strong,\" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. \"The concern is really more about the future and decelerating growth.\"\nMacy's earnings pushed the consumer discretionary sector higher, a day after government data showing an acceleration of consumer spending fanned inflation concerns and helped send U.S. government bond yields higher.\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit 3.10 percent for the first time since July 2011, continuing to pressure stocks as investors consider whether U.S. government bonds pose a more attractive option to riskier equities.\n\"As yields go up, they start to be a little bit more competitive with risk assets and with stocks in particular,\" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for the wealth management division of Northern Trust in Chicago.\nWeeks of diplomatic progress were thrown into doubt when North Korea postponed high-level talks with Seoul and threatened to pull out of its historic meeting with the United States.\nThe uncertainty compounded investor jitters ahead of United States-China trade negotiations.\n\"The general consensus seems to be we'll come to some sort of trade agreement,\" Carter said. \"But it may be choppy until we get there.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62.52 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,768.93, the S&P 500 gained 11.01 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,722.46, and the Nasdaq Composite added 46.67 points, or 0.63 percent, to 7,398.30.\nOf the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, only rate-sensitive utilities and real estate stocks closed in negative territory.\nThe tech sector rose 0.4 percent, and gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost among the major sectors.\nMicron Technology Inc rose 4.6 percent after RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage of the chipmaker with an \"outperform\" rating. The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index was up 1.4 percent.\nFacebook Inc shares were the biggest drag on the S&P 500, closing down 0.6 percent, on news that would appear before members of the European Parliament to answer questions about the improper use of users' data.\n3M Co weighed the most on the Dow, slipping 1.1 percent after Jefferies downgraded the stock to \"hold.\"\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.92-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 128 new highs and 48 new lows.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.22 billion shares, compared to the 6.66 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
