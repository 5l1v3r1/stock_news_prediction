Ford, General Motors and Tesla rose between 0.2 to 0.6 percent premarket.\nAt 7:34 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 27 points, or 0.11 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 2 points, or 0.07 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 0.75 points, or 0.01 percent.\nWall Street posted small gains on Wednesday after minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting suggested higher inflation may not result in faster interest rate hikes.\nShares of Victoria’s Secret-owner L Brands fell 5.9 percent, while those of data storage equipment maker NetApp dropped 3.9 percent following the companies’ weak forecasts.\nWilliams-Sonoma jumped 11.8 percent after the Pottery Barn owner posted strong quarterly results and gave a healthy forecast.\nInitial jobless claims is expected to have fallen to 220,000 for last week, from 222,000 the week before.
