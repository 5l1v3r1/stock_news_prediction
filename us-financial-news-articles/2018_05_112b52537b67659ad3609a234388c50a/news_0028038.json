This triggered the biggest banking crisis in the European Union member country since the 1990s.\nLast year, Bulgarian prosecutors said they had indicted the main shareholder of Corpbank Tsvetan Vassilev, two former deputy central bank governors and others over the demise of the Balkan country’s fourth largest lender.\nVassilev has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and blamed Corpbank’s collapse on a plot hatched by business rivals.\nThe collapse badly hurt confidence in the banking system and its regulation, prompting the central bank, under a new governor, to tighten supervision rules and carry out an asset quality review of all lenders. $1 = 1.6376 leva Reporting by Angel Krasimirov.
