For the first quarter of 2018, we reported revenues of $942,482, a 31% increase over 2017 first quarter revenues of $719,105. Our existing operations in Colorado continue to prosper with Security, Marketing and Operations segments each showing strong year-over-year revenue growth. The team and infrastructure we have built allows us to scale with the continued expansion within cannabis industry,” said Robert Frichtel, Chief Executive Officer of General Cannabis\n“We continue our focus on organic growth and driving each business segment to profitability,” said Joe Hodas, Chief Operating Officer of General Cannabis. “We have an aggressive, but achievable, plan to grow revenue in each of our existing business segments, while also evaluating opportunities for operational efficiencies. Hodas continued, “While California’s regulated market’s rollout has been slower than anticipated, we made great progress in the quarter developing several key relationships that we believe will generate revenue for both our Security and Operations segments in the second quarter and throughout 2018.”\nMr. Frichtel continued, “The California state regulated market continues to evolve and we are taking advantage of our experience to capitalize on this new market. We continue to work with a select group of well capitalized clients that are rolling out large scale cultivation centers. Our nationwide experience in regulated cannabis markets provides us, and our clients, a competitive advantage as the California cannabis market opens.”\nMichael Feinsod, Executive Chairman of General Cannabis, stated, “I am excited as we enter mid 2018 well capitalized and ready to take advantage of not only the organic growth in the cannabis industry, but also an increasing number of acquisition opportunities. During the first quarter, we expanded our management team with the addition of Joe Hodas. Joe’s impact is already being felt across the Company and our Denver office is stronger than ever. In light of traditional sources of capital remaining scarce for cannabis entrepreneurs, and industry qualified management teams even scarcer, General Cannabis has positioned itself to be a growth partner, allowing cannabis entrepreneurs to join our Company and scale their product and service offerings. Our Denver back office and strong balance sheet enables us to immediately help entrepreneurial cannabis companies achieve success. We continue to focus on growth through acquisition, to add value to our existing segments, promote synergies, and increase market share. We are eager to hear from principals or their representatives about cannabis related businesses that would like to be acquired by General Cannabis. We can promise confidentiality and a very fast answer -- usually within one day -- as to whether we're interested.”\nOur full results can be found at www.generalcann.com .\nAbout General Cannabis Corp\nGeneral Cannabis Corp is the comprehensive national resource for the highest quality service providers available to the regulated cannabis industry.
