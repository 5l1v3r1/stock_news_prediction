Leidner has been appointed as the Chief Financial Officer. Simplicity also confirmed its prior appointment of Leigh B. Smith as the group's Chief Operating Officer.\nCommenting on the announcement, Mr. Malloy said: \"Two years ago when we repositioned our business for growth, I chose Bruce to help lead our transformation and put us in position to become the leading insurance distribution business in the country. During this time, Bruce has demonstrated great leadership. Bruce has led our growth with the acquisition of seven new businesses and he has also strengthened and integrated our core distribution capabilities. I feel now is the perfect time to formally appoint Bruce as the day-to-day leader of Simplicity and for me to transition back to the Board.\"\n\"I am very grateful to Bill for his partnership and leadership over the last two years. We have grown Simplicity together and established a strong culture of partnership among our deep bench of insurance principals. While I will miss my day-to-day interactions with Bill, I am very pleased that he has agreed to continue with Simplicity as Chairman. I am also grateful to Aquiline Capital Partners for their confidence and the continued support of our business,\" said Mr. Donaldson.\nAquiline Capital Partners remains Simplicity's owner and Mitch Leidner, an Aquiline partner, now serves as Simplicity's Chief Financial Officer. \"Mitch brings a wealth of financial, capital markets, and general business expertise to the CFO position and we could not have a better professional to lead our finance team,\" said Mr. Donaldson.

Mr. Donaldson said: \"Over the last year, Leigh has demonstrated technical knowledge, operational expertise, and an overwhelming enthusiasm for driving production for Simplicity's advisors. She is the consummate professional and will continue to lead operational improvements for Simplicity.\"\nOver the last two years, Simplicity has reorganized its business and its management team with the sole focus of building the leading insurance distribution business in the country.
