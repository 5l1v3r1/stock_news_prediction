(\"EWS\") (TSX VENTURE:EWS) (the \"Company\"), announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a North American company for the sale of a TR4000 waste tire system, which uses EWS’s patented Reverse Polymerization™ technology. The system, which is expandable, will initially be capable of processing 4,000 tires a day (12,000 metric tons per year). Besides Syngas, which is used to generate power to run the plant, the facility will produce 5.4 million kilograms of reclaimed Carbon Black and 5.2 million liters of oil. Each of these commodities can be sold back into industry to produce rubber, plastic, coatings and many other valuable products. The sale is subject to completion of definitive documentation, including a technology licensing contract and customary closing conditions. There is no guarantee that the sale will close.\nBob MacBean, CEO said “This is an important milestone and exciting time for EWS. We believe our technology is uniquely positioned to deal with the worldwide waste rubber problem in a profitable and environmentally friendly manner. We are currently in various stages of discussion with prospective customers or partners in countries around the world, which underscores the global nature of the problem and the attractiveness of our technology solution. The signing of this MOU comes after extensive due diligence conducted by this customer who concluded that our technology was superior from both an economic and environmental perspective. As with most emerging technologies, and almost all regulated industries such as waste management, there is a long lead time associated with business development initiatives. Nonetheless, I am pleased with the activity we are seeing in our sales pipeline.”\nAbout Environmental Waste International Inc.\nEnvironmental Waste International, Inc. specializes in eco-friendly systems for the breakdown of organic materials, including tires.
