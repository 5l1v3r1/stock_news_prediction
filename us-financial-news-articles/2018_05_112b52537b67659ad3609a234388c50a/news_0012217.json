The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Core net income, core earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue are non-GAAP financial measures.\nCore net income and core earnings per share exclude certain items, specifically amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring related costs, minimum pension liability adjustments, non-core charges associated with our convertible notes and revolving credit facility, global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation and other costs, and other non-core or non-recurring gains or losses that arise from time to time.\nNon-core charges associated with our convertible notes and revolving credit facility consist of the amortization of debt issuance and debt discount costs. Acquisition and integration-related expenses include legal and professional fees and other direct transaction costs associated with business and asset acquisitions, costs associated with integrating acquired businesses, including costs for transitional employees or services, integration related professional services costs and other incremental charges we incur as a direct result of acquisition and integration efforts. Global ERP system implementation and other costs relate to direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with our multi-phase implementation of a new, global ERP solution, the related technology infrastructure and costs related to our implementation of the new revenue recognition standard under US GAAP.\nIn computing diluted core earnings per share, we exclude the weighted average dilutive effect of shares issuable under our convertible notes to the extent that any such dilution would be offset by our note hedges; the note hedges would be considered an anti-dilutive security under GAAP.\nPeriodically, such as in periods that include significant foreign currency volatility, we may present certain metrics on a “constant currency” basis, to show the impact of period to period results normalized for the impact of foreign currency rate changes. We calculate constant currency information by translating prior period financial results using current period foreign exchange rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue represent our GAAP net income or loss, adjusted for charges related to interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and other charges, as noted in the reconciliation that follows.\nWe believe that these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for an evaluation of the company with a focus on the performance of its core operations, including more meaningful comparisons of financial results to historical periods and to the financial results of less acquisitive peer and competitor companies. Our executive management team uses these same non-GAAP financial measures internally to assess the ongoing performance of the company. Additionally, the same non-GAAP information is used for planning purposes, including the preparation of operating budgets and in communications with our board of directors with respect to our core financial performance. Since this information is not a GAAP measurement of financial performance, there are material limitations to its usefulness on a stand-alone basis, including the lack of comparability of this presentation to the GAAP financial results of other companies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures (Continued)\nReconciliation of Core Net Income\nA reconciliation of core net income to GAAP net loss for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands) GAAP net loss $ (1,002 ) $ (6,624 ) $ (2,155 ) $ (27,478 ) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 5,818 6,006 16,708 18,381 Goodwill impairment charge — — — 7,529 Stock-based compensation expense 8,592 7,354 25,132 24,209 Acquisition and integration-related expenses 224 501 1,596 2,272 Restructuring expenses 1,485 561 1,476 561 Global ERP system implementation and other costs 1,558 2,076 4,973 6,673 Minimum pension liability adjustments (3 ) 264 35 805 Amortization of debt issuance and debt discount costs 108 3,592 6,393 10,418 Non-recurring tax benefit (1) — — (4,402 ) (4,461 ) Tax effects on non-GAAP income (4,916 ) (4,726 ) (14,035 ) (11,856 ) Core net income $ 11,864 $ 9,004 $ 35,721 $ 27,053 (1) The non-recurring tax benefit in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 represents a benefit arising from the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
