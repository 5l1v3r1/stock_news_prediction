The U.S. Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed wages barely rose last month, which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up, likely keeping the Fed on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening. Asia shares ex-Japan were 0.5 percent higher. In Southeast Asia, Philippines edged up, largely led by real estate and telecommunication stocks. Property developer SM Prime Holdings gained as much as 1.9 percent, while Globe Telecom surged as much as 6.8 percent on higher quarterly profit. Jakarta's main index snapped two sessions of losses to rise 1.1 percent. PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia was the top mover, climbing 2.1 percent. A Reuters poll showed the country's GDP expanded 5.18 percent in the first quarter, above the central bank's outlook of 5.1 percent. Malaysian shares extended losses to shed as much as 1.1 percent, to hit their lowest in one month. \"The market is on the downside as we are headed for elections and money investors are trimming their investments from equities,\" said Nik-Ihsan, an analyst at Maybank Kim Eng. The country will hold general elections on Wednesday. Singapore inched down to a more than two-week low, dragged lower by financials. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp fell as much 3.2 percent after the lender posted quarterly profits below estimates.
