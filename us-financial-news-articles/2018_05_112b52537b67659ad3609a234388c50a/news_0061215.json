The ministry has not published full-year data for 2017.\nMultinational corporations speaking at the forum said they were committed to raising discharge standards in their Chinese supply chains, but regional imbalances posed problems.\nLuc Desbrun, technical manager with the sourcing unit of Nestle in Shanghai, said his company’s relatively high discharge standards has made it easier to comply with tougher Chinese controls.\nHowever, he said one factory was located in a region with phosphorus discharge standards “way below” its own, forcing it to make modifications.\n“It is an issue of competitiveness all around the world when corporate standards are higher than local standards,” he said. “There is a gap and it depends on the region.”\nHenry Zhuang, who works on sustainability with Ikea in China, said the furniture maker’s local suppliers welcomed the company’s higher standards, saying they served as a “firewall” against competitors.\n“Costs are definitely higher, but after raising their standards, they also have a stable order book,” he said.
