(NYSE-American: SENS), a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of a long-term, implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system for people with diabetes, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRECENT HIGHLIGHTS & ACCOMPLISHMENTS:\nFavorable outcome of FDA advisory committee meeting with unanimous support for Eversense Realized revenue, through our European partners, of $2.9 million in the first quarter 2018 Strengthened balance sheet with additional $53 million of gross proceeds through completion of convertible note offering\n“In the first quarter, we achieved a significant milestone with the successful FDA panel advisory meeting and have made meaningful progress with commercial readiness activities in the United States. We have been simultaneously deepening our presence in the countries where Eversense is currently available and enhancing our offering with the recent addition of the extended life Eversense XL,” said Tim Goodnow, President and Chief Executive Officer of Senseonics. “In the remaining time in 2018, we anticipate launching Eversense in the United States, introducing Eversense XL across the European marketplace and initiating a pivotal trial for labeling of up to 180 days of wear in the United States.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS:\nRevenue was $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 sales and marketing expenses increased $2.3 million year-over year, to $3.4 million The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expense associated with hiring efforts to prepare for U.S. launch in 2018 as well as to support and expand the distribution of Eversense in Europe.\nFirst quarter 2018 research and development expenses increased $1.1 million year-over-year, to $8.1 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by the on-going support of our PMA application as well as on-going feasibility trials.\nFirst quarter 2018 general and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million, year-over-year, to $4.0 million. The increase in general and administration expenses was primarily driven by an increase in compensation, legal and other administrative expense associated with supporting operational growth.\nNet loss was $22.3 million, or $0.16 per share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $13.1 million, or $0.14 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. This increase in net loss was driven primarily by the $4.8 million increase in the fair value of the derivative liability and the $3.6 million increase in operating expense. First quarter 2018 net loss per share was based on 137.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to 93.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 30, 2018, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $65.1 million and outstanding indebtedness was $75.5 million.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST INFORMATION\nCompany management will host a conference call at 4:30 pm (Eastern Time) today, May 10, 2018, to discuss these financial results.
