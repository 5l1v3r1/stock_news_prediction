He pleaded not guilty.\nMagistrate Belinda Wallington handed down her decision that Pell’s case will proceed to trial in a Melbourne court, following a month-long pre-trial hearing.\nPell did not comment when he left the court, surrounded by police and flanked by his legal team.\nPope Francis has said he would not comment on the case involving his economy minister until it was over.\nThe Vatican said in a statement that it had “taken note” of the court’s decision and that the leave of absence the pope granted Pell last year so he can defend himself “is still in place”.\nA statement issued by Pell’s lawyers and distributed by the Sydney Archdiocese, his last employer before his Vatican posting in 2014, said Pell had fully cooperated with police investigators and “always and steadfastly maintained his innocence”.\n“He would like to thank all those who have supported him from both here in Australia and overseas during this exacting time and is grateful for their continuing support and prayers,” the statement said.\nIn her ruling, Wallington dismissed what Pell’s lawyer has called “the worst of the charges” leveled against his client, but said allegations of offences at a pool and at a church in Victoria state will be heard.

He has handed over his passports, Gibson told the court.
