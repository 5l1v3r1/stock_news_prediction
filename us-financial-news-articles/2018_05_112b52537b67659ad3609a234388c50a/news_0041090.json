Coming out there and bowling at set batsmen who are trying to finish the job — he’s doing it perfectly for us.”\nHis ability to bowl yorkers almost at will and his unpredictable bounce make him a death-overs nightmare for most batsmen. He attributes it all to clear thinking.\n“Clarity is very important when you bowl at the death otherwise there’ll be doubt,” he said after collecting his man-of-the-match award.\n“Even on a bad day when a batsman hits you, you just have to execute your plan. (Rahul) has been batting really well so it’s sometimes difficult to bowl to a batsman like that. But I was backing myself.\n“I was clear ... On this wicket when the slower ball was bowled on a good length, it wasn’t gripping, so I looked to bowl a dipper and it worked.” Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Ian Ransom", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T09:16:22.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
