The warning applies to whole heads and hearts of romaine, as well as chopped romaine, baby romaine, and salads containing romaine lettuce. Restaurants and retailers are also being advised to ask their suppliers about where their lettuce comes from.\nPeople typically get sick from E. coli an average of three to four days after ingesting the bacteria, according to the CDC . Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, severe stomach cramps, and vomiting. While most people recover within a week, others can develop more severe symptoms â€” 14 of those hospitalized due to the current outbreak developed a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, the CDC said.
