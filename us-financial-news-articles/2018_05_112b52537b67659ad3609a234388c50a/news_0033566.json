His 64th career victory and third in Spain. He now holds the record for wins from pole (41). He also has a record 30 successive races in the points. This was also Mercedes’ first one-two of the campaign and sent them back on top.\n-\nFERRARI (Sebastian Vettel 4, Kimi Raikkonen retired)\nVettel, second after the first corner, finished off the podium for the third race in a row and is now 17 points behind Hamilton. He made two stops, while others made just one, and it cost him. Raikkonen retired after cruising back to the pits with reduced power.\n-\nRED BULL (Max Verstappen 3, Daniel Ricciardo 5)\nVerstappen’s first podium of the season and the 150th for Red Bull in Formula One. He had started fifth, and damaged his front wing when he hit the back of Stroll’s Williams. Ricciardo set the fastest lap of the race, a record 1:18.441, on lap 61.\n-\nRENAULT (Carlos Sainz 7, Nico Hulkenberg retired)\nRenault moved above McLaren and into fourth place for the first time, albeit by a single point. Sainz scored in his home race for the fourth year in a row. Hulkenberg retired for the second successive race, taken out by Grosjean at the start.\n-\nMCLAREN (Fernando Alonso 8, Stoffel Vandoorne retired)\nMcLaren drop down but Alonso, who started eighth, again delivered in his home race. The Spaniard has scored in every race so far. Vandoorne pulled over with a suspected gearbox problem, the team’s first retirement of the season.\n-\nHAAS (Kevin Magnussen 6, Romain Grosjean retired)\nMagnussen, who started seventh, has scored all of his team’s points so far, moving them above Force India. Grosjean spun at the start and took out Hulkenberg and Toro Rosso’s Gasly. He has a three-place grid penalty for Monaco.\n-\nFORCE INDIA (Sergio Perez 9, Esteban Ocon retired)\nOcon retired with an oil pressure problem. Perez started 15th and lost positions at the start avoiding Grosjean. He made the right strategy call by pitting when the virtual safety car was deployed but ran over front wing debris from Verstappen’s car that caused some damage.\n-\nTORO ROSSO (Brendon Hartley 12, Pierre Gasly retired)\nHartley started at the back of the grid after a big crash in final practice on Saturday meant he missed qualifying. He then kept out of trouble while Gasly was taken out on lap one.\n-\nSAUBER (Charles Leclerc 10, Marcus Ericsson 13)\nLeclerc scored points for the second race in a row, setting him up nicely for the next in his home town of Monaco. Ericsson defended well against Sainz early on.\n-\nWILLIAMS (Lance Stroll 11, Sergey Sirotkin 14)\nThe former champions are rock bottom and with little in the way of positive news as they wrestle with aerodynamic problems.
