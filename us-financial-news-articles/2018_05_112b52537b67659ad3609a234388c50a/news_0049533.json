REUTERS/Max Rossi\nThe anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League, which are working to set up a new government, have a plan to halt the sale of Alitalia. Last month, Germany’s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ), budget carriers EasyJet ( EZJ.L ) and Wizz Air ( WIZZ.L ) submitted expressions of interest in at least parts of the airline.\n“I hear talk of nationalisation; think carefully about this option, I doubt it would be feasible,” Calenda said during a conference in Rome.\n“There are some serious offers, let’s not lose them again,” he added.
