The Bulgarian transport association said around 120,000 drivers from the country would lose their jobs under the proposed rule changes.\nTrucks from Bulgaria and other low-wage eastern European countries are a common sight on the roads of western Europe, competing with local firms whose drivers are much higher paid.\nUnder the package, backed by France, Germany and other higher-wage states, truck drivers from eastern Europe would receive the same payment for work abroad as those employed by western European transport companies.\nThe package has long been the subject of negotiations between EU member states and has yet to be laid before the European Parliament.\nThe Bulgarian government backed the local truck companies. “We declare our strong support for Bulgarian carriers,” Transport Minister Ivaylo Moskovski said.\nPrime Minister Boyko Borissov, who is hosting the EU summit, said the proposed changes would “kill the Bulgarian sector”.\nDrivers from Bulgaria, where average monthly wages of little more than 500 euros ($600) are among the lowest in the EU, often spend weeks moving loads between countries including Germany, France and Britain before returning to their home base.\nUnder the package, drivers would have to rest for at least 45 hours in a hotel rather than their cab and return home every three weeks.\nBulgarian transport firms said this would nullify eastern European companies’ competitive advantage.\n“These restrictions are absolutely unnecessary,” Vladislav Kalchev, owner of a transport company, said. “They are trying to help, in some way, the market in the big countries.”\nEuropean Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc invited the Bulgarian government on Monday to propose changes to the initiative, saying the current rules were not working.\n“They are causing chaos ... and keeping the existing rules is not a good solution for the sector,” Bulc said, adding that the European Commission believes that the drivers should choose where to spend the obligatory rest period - at home or where they are located.
