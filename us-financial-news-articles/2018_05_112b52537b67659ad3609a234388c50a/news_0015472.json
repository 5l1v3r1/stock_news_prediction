In addition, average earnings growth, a closely-monitored inflation indicator, grew by just 0.1 percent in April after rising 0.3 percent the previous month.\nIn early morning trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year yields fell to 2.914 percent from 2.946 percent late on Thursday.\nU.S. 30-year bonds slid to 3.089 percent, from Thursday’s 3.121 percent.
