But, given the importance of the proposals, the Bulgarian presidency could opt for a postponement of the vote, as it did at a meeting in March to wait for the swearing-in of the new German government.\nThe possible delay would however highlight EU discomfort at dealing with a new Italian government of the anti-establishment 5-Star and the far-right League dedicated to a high-spending programme that calls into question crucial fiscal and banking rules of the European Union.\nThe decision on whether sealing or delaying the deal will be made on Friday after a public debate among EU finance ministers, a spokeswoman for the EU’s current Bulgarian presidency said.
