Tesla said: “Tesla’s own testing has found braking distances with an average of 133 feet when conducting the 60-0 mph stops using the 18” Michelin all season tire and as low as 126 feet with all tires currently available.\n“Unlike other vehicles, Tesla is uniquely positioned to address more corner cases over time through over-the-air software updates, and it continually does so to improve factors such as stopping distance.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T20:12:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
