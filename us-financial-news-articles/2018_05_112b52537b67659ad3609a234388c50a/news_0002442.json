Its 1,300 percent rise in 2017 was followed by a sharp correction this year. The cryptocurrency lost nearly half of its value in the first three months of 2018, according to data from CoinDesk.\nMastercard's CEO made it clear on the call that cryptocurrency is not a major part of corporate strategy because of its unpredictability.\n\"This is not something we count on because we just don't know how to predict it or we don't even want to count it,\" Banga said.\nWhile the cryptocurrency factor is \"interesting,\" it's also not a key factor for Mastercard's value, said James Friedman, analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.\n\"It's their job to transact anywhere that the consumer or merchant carries their card, and cryptocurrencies is the place it's showing up,\" Friedman said. \"But I don't think it's relevant to the Mastercard investment thesis, we won't penalize them for it.\"\nShares of Mastercard charged more than 3 percent higher Wednesday after the company reported first-quarter profit and revenue that beat Wall Street analysts' expectations.
