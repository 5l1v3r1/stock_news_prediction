Sales growth in the unit has averaged about 33 percent in the last five quarters.\nThe results come after the company in March settled with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp and agreed to add two directors, including former Amazon.com chief information security officer Tom Killalea.\nThe company also set up a financial operation committee to lift its operating margin to 30 percent by 2020.\n“With the recent involvement of Elliott Management, margins now look poised to reverse the downward trend seen over recent years,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a pre-earnings note.
