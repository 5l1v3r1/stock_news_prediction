Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nA Gaz logo on a car produced by the GAZ Group , in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, in 2015. Bloomberg News Good morning. The U.S. Treasury Department gave Americans more time to unwind their ties to a vehicle maker linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripsaka, as the firm works to get out from under sanctions.\nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said Tuesday it issued a license allowing transactions necessary for the winding down of operations at GAZ Group , which is about 60% owned by Russian Machines , a company controlled by Mr. Deripaska. The license allows for the use of frozen funds until Oct. 23 to conduct the necessary transactions, though assets will remain otherwise blocked. Treasury also said GAZ could escape sanctions by breaking ties with Mr. Deripaska.\n“The path for the U.S. to provide sanctions relief” to GAZ Group is “through divestment and relinquishment of control” by anyone on the U.S. blacklist, including Mr. Deripaska, OFAC said in a frequently-asked-question document .\nMr. Deripaska was hit with U.S. sanctions in April as part of a broad sweep of measures targeting Russian oligarchs. He has said he doesn’t separate himself from the Russian state, but the sanctions targeting him have put a strain on his business relationships. For example, Russian energy-related firm EN+ Group PLC accepted his resignation from its board of directors as part of a plan from Chairman Lord Barker to get EN+ and aluminum giant United Co. Rusal PLC off the U.S. sanctions list .\nThe license is another example of OFAC’s increasingly frequent effort to calibrate the effects of its sanctions, especially against major companies, said Adam M. Smith, a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP.\n“Allowing such wind-downs used to be rare but they have become common,” he said, noting how they “limit harm to innocent parties” but also give “further time to remove any oligarch ownership or control of the company.”\nIt was the latest in a flurry of activity from the Treasury’s sanctions office in the past two weeks. Much of the activity has involved Venezuela, Iran or Hezbollah, with multiple announcements of new sanctions targets and allegations of malign activity. The moves could push the limits of U.S. sanctions power, if Washington’s allies stop following the U.S. line, said some observers.\nVenezuela on Tuesday expelled two U.S. diplomats in apparent response to U.S. sanctions barring the purchase of public debt and the targeting of the country’s second-most powerful official.\nIran has reacted harshly to U.S. conditions for achieving a new nuclear dea l following Washington’s exit from the agreement, as well as sanctions targeting alleged weapons trafficking to the Houthis in Yemen and links to Hezbollah .\nEuropean companies have already begun to walk away from Iran in response to U.S. aggressiveness and they are likely to continue leaving the country despite efforts to protect them, said the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis, advisory and consulting organization.\n“The EU and member states are playing a weak hand. They are asking companies to rely on novel financial mechanisms and political commitments against the established and aggressive enforcement track record of U.S. regulators,” the group said in a policy note.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nCrisis-management experts assess PPG Industries ‘s public handling of a disclosure that some of its employees had made improper accounting entries at the direction of the company’s now-former controller.\nThe U.K. Serious Fraud Office brought additional charges Tuesday against two people facing trial in its ongoing investigation of Monaco-based Unaoil Group .\nCOMPLIANCE\nThe U.S. Congress moved to relax crisis-era restrictions on financial firms, as the House approved a plan to ease rules for small and midsize banks.The measure now advances to President Donald Trump for his signature, setting off deregulatory actions by federal agencies that will ease—but not dismantle—the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, the WSJ reports.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said the move will help free the U.S. economy from overregulation.
