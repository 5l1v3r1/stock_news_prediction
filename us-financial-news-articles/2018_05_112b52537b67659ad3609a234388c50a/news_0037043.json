Not saving for retirement early enough is the most common regret. Not saving enough for emergency expenses comes in second.\nTaking on debt seems to be a lesser concern, according to the findings. Only 10 percent of respondents cite too much credit card debt at their biggest regret, while 8 percent wish they could remake their student loan decisions.\nLack of savings does appear to be a serious, ongoing problem in the U.S. Northwestern Mutual's 2018 Planning & Progress Study found that 21 percent of Americans have nothing saved at all for their golden years, and a third of Americans have less than $5,000.\nForgoing contributions to a retirement fund could be costing Americans hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
