May was the first international leader to visit Trump in Washington after his inauguration last year.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T03:02:33.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
