D’Angelo is currently the head of Europe for ZZ Capital International while Feller is the head of North America, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nHong Kong-based ZZ Capital International Ltd agreed last July to buy Alerian, a Dallas-based financial index and data provider, for $582 million in cash and up to $230 million in additional payments if it hit revenue targets from 2018 to 2021.\nThe firm had been attempting to restructure the deal after missing two deadlines to close the transaction.\nChina’s clampdown last year on bank lending for overseas investments has required ZZ Capital to seek offshore funding for its existing deal pipeline and to slow new mergers and acquisition proposals, it said in a regulatory filing in February.\nA U.S.-based spokesman for Aretex could not be reached outside work hours. ZZ Capital’s shares were suspended before trading began on Wednesday, pending an announcement.\nReporting by Kane Wu; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:12:41.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
