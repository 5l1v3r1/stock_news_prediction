China's refinery runs rose nearly 12 percent in April from a year earlier, to around 12.06 million barrels per day, marking the second-highest level on record on a daily basis, data showed.\nAdditionally, the market retreated as the U.S. Dollar strengthened against other currencies to the highest since December. As the dollar strengthens, investors can retreat from dollar-denominated commodities like oil.\nDespite these downward forces, the market retains support from OPEC and other producers' production cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran.\nWorld oil prices have surged by more than 70 percent over the last year as demand has risen sharply while production has been restricted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and other producers, including Russia.\nThe United States has announced it will impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, raising fears that markets will face shortages later this year when trade restrictions take effect.\nThe tightening market has all but eliminated a global supply overhang that depressed crude prices between late 2014 and early 2017.\nOPEC figures published on Monday showed oil inventories in OECD industrialized nations in March fell to 9 million barrels above the five-year average, from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017.\nU.S. crude is trading at a hefty discount to Brent, the international marker, thanks to sharp rises in U.S. production to 10.7 million bpd, which has left the American domestic oil market well supplied.\nU.S. shale oil production is expected to rise by about 145,000 bpd to a record 7.18 million bpd in June, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore and Christopher Johnson in London; Editing by Dale Hudson and Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T08:16:48.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
