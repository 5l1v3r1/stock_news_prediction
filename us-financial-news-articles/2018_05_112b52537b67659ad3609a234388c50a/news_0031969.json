The increase was the result of increased professional services fees to the Company’s largest client as measured by revenue. Net income was $928,744 in the First Quarter of 2018 as compared to a net loss of $646,302 in the First Quarter of 2017. Net income in the First Quarter of 2018 was favorably impacted by higher revenues from existing clients combined with lower employee and IT consulting staffing as compared to the First Quarter 2017, primarily as a result of the implementation of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2017.\nDavid Anderson, Chief Executive Officer, stated, ”Our first quarter 2018 results are very much in line with our expectations and continue the positive momentum from late 2017. Our focus in 2018 is to continue this positive momentum.”\nAbout InsPro Enterprise\nInsPro Enterprise, a Life and Health insurance policy administration system, is a single technology solution used to manage all insurance processing requirements supporting multiple product lines as well as hybrid products for both group and individual policies on a single web-based platform.
