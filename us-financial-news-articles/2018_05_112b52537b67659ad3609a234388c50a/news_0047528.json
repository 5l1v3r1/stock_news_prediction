REUTERS/Jean-Pauil Pelissier\nIt is the third time that the unions have sought to stage a show of strength in such a way since Macron began his five-year term in May 2017. A previous one drew some 320,000 people into the streets in March.\nThe 40-year-old leader has shown no sign of surrender so far.

REUTERS/Jean-Pauil Pelissier\nTuesday’s call came from all of the large labour unions plus many smaller ones and involved organisation of street rallies in about 140 cities, towns and villages across France.

Also on the cards is an increased recourse to contract hiring rather than the job-for-life recruitment that is standard in the civil service.\nIn all, France has about 5.7 million employees in government administration, state agencies, schools and hospitals.\nThe latest protest dovetails with one specific to France’s national railways: services have been disrupted for several days each week since early April by strikes over plans end the SNCF train company’s monopoly, and with it the hiring of rail workers on more protective contracts than other sectors.\n“We’re demonstrating in defence of a public service that is there to serves everyone, wherever in the country they live,” Philippe Martinez, head of the Communist-linked CGT union, told RTL radio.
