The person is in custody, and the extradition procedure is in charge of Croatian judicial bodies,” Hina cited a police statement as saying.\nPolice representatives were not immediately available to comment.\nHina also said, citing media reports, that a Tunisian official earlier confirmed that two suspects had been identified and one had been arrested in Croatia.\nMohammed Zawari, an aerospace engineer and drone expert, was shot dead in December 2016 near the city of Sfax. The Tunisian authorities later said that they had arrested 10 Tunisians but that two foreigners suspected of plotting the killing had escaped.\nHamas blamed Israel for the killing of Zawari, who it said had been a member of its organization for 10 years.
