BAKERY DEALS\nJAB, whose owners the publicity-shy Reimann family are descended from Ludwig Reimann, a chemist who in the 19th century joined the chemicals business founded by Johann Adam Benckiser and married into Benckiser’s family, has also made a string of deals including for bakery chains Au Bon Pain and Panera Bread, as well as Krispy Kreme. Slideshow (3 Images)\nNestle meanwhile recently boosted its position as the world’s biggest coffee company with a $7.15 billion licensing deal with Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ).\nBridgepoint bought a majority stake in Pret a decade ago for about 345 million pounds and had been examining an exit via a New York stock market listing before opting to sell to JAB.\nThe sale price represents a multiple of 15 times Pret’s 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of more than 100 million pounds, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n“Management’s proven track record and commitment to customer service, investment in innovation and approach to freshly prepared food position Pret well as it capitalises on evolving consumer taste and lifestyle preferences,” said JAB Chief Executive Olivier Goudet.\nThe sale to the Reimann family’s firm was first reported by the Financial Times.\nThe Pret sale comes a month after Whitbread ( WTB.L ) said it would demerge its Costa coffee chain within two years, a lengthy timeframe that stoked speculation Costa may attract a bidder which some bankers speculated could be JAB.\nJP Morgan advised Bridgepoint on the Pret deal, while JAB worked with HSBC.
