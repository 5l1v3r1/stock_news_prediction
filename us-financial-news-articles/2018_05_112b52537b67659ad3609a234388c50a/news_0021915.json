A U.S. trade delegation visited Beijing last week for talks but left without significant progress in resolving an escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.\n“The United States must put away its threatening stick. China’s position has not changed and will not change,” Gao said. He said China opposed protectionism and unilateralism in trade relations.\nBeijing has previously said it will not negotiate on its core interests, though it has not clearly defined what those are.\n“We hope that China-U.S. trade relations can become a powerful driving force for sustained growth of the global economy.”\nChina on Wednesday confirmed that Vice Premier Liu He will visit the U.S. to discuss trade at an appropriate time.\nReporting by Elias Glenn; writing by Se Young Lee and Kevin Yao; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:34:16.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
