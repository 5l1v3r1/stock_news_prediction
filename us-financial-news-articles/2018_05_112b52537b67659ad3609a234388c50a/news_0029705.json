Iran and the Houthis dismiss Saudi accusations that Tehran arms the group.\nCoalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said Saudi air defense forces had tracked the rocket but that it landed in an uninhabited area, according to a report from the official Saudi Press Agency.\nThe Houthis fired a salvo of missiles at Riyadh last week, with one falling short of the capital and another intercepted by Saudi air defense forces, Malki said at the time.
