(TSX:PTS) (Nasdaq:PCOM) (Points), the global leader in powering loyalty commerce, is reporting financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Points adopted International Financial Reporting Standard 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) - effective January 1, 2018 and applied these new accounting policies retrospectively. Accordingly, 2017 comparative amounts have been restated.\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and all amounts are in USD. The complete first quarter Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis, including segmented results, are available at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue increased 7% to $89.1 million compared to $83.1 million.\nGross profit 1 increased 22% to a Q1 record $13.5 million compared to $11.1 million.\nNet Income increased significantly to $2.3 million or $0.16 per share, compared to $0.9 million or $0.06 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA 2 increased 66% to a Q1 record $4.8 million compared to $2.9 million.\nRecent Operational Highlights\nLaunched a new Loyalty Currency Retailing partnership with Emirates, one of the world’s fastest growing airlines, to expand their Skywards program.\nLaunched new Points Travel partnership with Singapore Airlines, enabling their members to redeem miles in over 300,000 hotels worldwide.\nLaunched a first-of-its kind fuel rewards program with Marathon Fuels.\nLaunched new Points Travel service with current partner, Amtrak.\nLaunched new hotel distribution partnership with Priceline Partner Network, opening wholesale access to leading hotels worldwide for the Points Travel service\nManagement Commentary\n“Our strong momentum from last year has carried into 2018, as reflected by our record first quarter gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, the most important financial metrics in our business,” said Rob Maclean, CEO of Points International. “These results were driven by continued robust growth in our core Loyalty Currency Retailing (LCR) segment, which continues to benefit from organic growth with existing clients and new partner wins over the course of 2017.\n“We are also gaining increased traction in our Platform Partners and Points Travel segments. In fact, today we announced the launch of a new Points Travel engagement with Singapore Airlines, a flagship carrier and one of the strongest brands in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, we are pleased to now offer hotel inventory from the Priceline Partner Network. With Priceline inventory now added to the more than 250,000 worldwide hotel properties that Points Travel has access to, our competitive position in the marketplace continues to strengthen.\n“Looking ahead, we plan to carry this momentum through 2018, led by a healthy pipeline of new business opportunities, strong cash generation from our LCR services and the increasing traction of Platform Partners and Points Travel. We expect the execution of our strategy across all three business segments to generate another record year of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 7% to $89.1 million compared to $83.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Principal revenue increased 4% to $83.3 million, and other partner revenue increased 75% to $5.8 million.\nGross profit in the first quarter increased 22% to a record $13.5 million compared to $11.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily driven by organic growth from existing partners and new partner wins in LCR, and to a lesser extent, growth in Points Travel.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses 3 in the first quarter of 2018 were $8.8 million compared to $8.2 million in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of gross profit, adjusted operating expenses improved significantly to 65.0% compared to 73.9%.\nNet income increased significantly to $2.3 million or $0.16 per share, compared to $0.9 million or $0.06 per share in the year-ago quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter increased 66% to a record $4.8 million compared to $2.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in gross profit and prudent cost management.\nAt March 31, 2018, total funds available, comprised of cash and cash equivalents together with restricted cash and funds receivable from payment processors, was $77.8 million compared to $79.2 million at December 31, 2017. The company continues to be debt free.\nDuring the first quarter, Points repurchased for cancellation approximately 133,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $10.82 per share through its Automatic Share Purchase Plan in conjunction with its Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB). As of March 31, 2018, the company had approximately 285,000 shares remaining in its NCIB authorization.\n2018 Outlook\nPoints continues to expect gross profit to increase between 10% and 20% compared to $47.0 million in 2017.

Management uses certain non-GAAP measures, which are defined in the appropriate sections of this press release, to better assess the corporation's underlying performance. These measures are reviewed regularly by management and the corporation's Board of Directors in assessing the corporation's performance and in making decisions about ongoing operations. We believe that these measures are also used by investors as an indicator of the corporation's operating performance. Readers are cautioned that these terms are not recognized GAAP measures and do not have a standardized GAAP meaning under IFRS and should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS terms, such as net income.\nInvestor Relations Contact\nSean Mansouri or Cody Slach\nLiolios Group, Inc.\n949-574-3860\nPCOM@liolios.com\n1 Gross profit is defined as total revenues less the direct cost of revenues. Gross profit is considered by management to be an integral measure of financial performance and represents the amount of revenues retained by the Corporation after incurring direct costs. However, gross profit is not a recognized measure of profitability under IFRS. 2 Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange and share-based compensation) is considered by management to be a useful supplemental measure when assessing financial performance. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the Corporation’s ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future capital expenditures and working capital needs. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for Net Income, which we believe to be the most directly comparable IFRS measure. 3 Adjusted operating expenses consist of employment expenses excluding stock based compensation, marketing and communications, technology services and other operating expenses. Adjusted operating expense is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for total expenses, which we believe to be the most directly comparable IFRS measure.\nKey Financial Measures and Schedule of Non-GAAP Reconciliations Gross Profit Information 4 Expressed in thousands of United States dollars For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 5 Total Revenue\n$\n89,110\n$\n83,115\nDirect cost of principal revenue 75,594 72,056 Gross Profit $ 13,516 $ 11,059 Gross Margin 15 % 13 %\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA 6 Expressed in thousands of United States dollars For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Net Income $ 2,258 $ 852 Share-based compensation 975 673 Income tax expense 862 391 Depreciation and Amortization 866 990 Foreign Exchange gain (158 ) (6 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,803 $ 2,900\nReconciliation of Total Expenses to Adjusted Operating Expenses 7 Expressed in thousands of United States dollars For the three months ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Total Expenses $ 86,067 $ 81,889 Subtract (add): Direct cost of revenue 75,594 72,056 Depreciation and amortization 866 990 Foreign Exchange gain (158 ) (6 ) Stock-based compensation 975 673 Adjusted Operating Expenses $ 8,790 $ 8,176 4 Gross Profit is defined as total revenues less the direct cost of principal revenues.
