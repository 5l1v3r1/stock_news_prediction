Today the government will get weaker as the political scene is deeply divided,” said Kamel Morjan, head of the small Moubadara party, which is part of the government.\nSeven prime ministers have failed to fix a sluggish economy. Turmoil and militant attacks have deterred investors and tourists, eroding living standards of ordinary people and causing an increase in unemployment.\nAnnual inflation hit a record level of 7.7 percent in April as the dinar tanked, making food imports more expensive.\nThe IMF is due to review the next tranche of its loan plan in June, diplomats said.\nChahed has been pushing to overhaul loss-making state firms, making enemies with the powerful labor union UGTT.\n“We failed to reach an agreement (on the economic program)... We are not committed to any decision in the future,” UGTT leader Noureddine Taboubi said, declining further comment.\nWriting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T21:20:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
