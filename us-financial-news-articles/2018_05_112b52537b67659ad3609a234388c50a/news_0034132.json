REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo The bodies were recovered in October after the area where they were buried was recaptured from the jihadist group.\nThe Coptic Christians were beheaded on a beach in February 2015 wearing orange jumpsuits, according to a video posted by Islamic State.\nTheir bodies will be flown from the western city of Misrata to Egypt, a Libyan official said, adding that there was an additional victim from Ghana. A total of 21 people were beheaded in the incident.\nIslamic State took control of Sirte in 2015 and lost the city late last year to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami and Ayman Salhi; writing by Ulf Laessing; editing by John Stonestreet and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T09:44:38.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
