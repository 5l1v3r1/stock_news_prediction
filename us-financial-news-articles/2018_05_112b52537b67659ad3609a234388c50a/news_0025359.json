They were at minus 0.105 percent and 0.735 percent respectively.\nTen-year JGB futures rose 0.03 point to 150.83, but they were flat on the week, with many investors expecting the market to move sideways given the Bank of Japan’s strong control of the market to keep the 10-year yield around zero percent.\nReflecting rising expectations of range-bound trading, S&P-JPX JGB Vix, a measure of JGB options implied volatilities, has hit a record low of 1.22 the previous day.\n$1 = 109.42 yen Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:26:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
