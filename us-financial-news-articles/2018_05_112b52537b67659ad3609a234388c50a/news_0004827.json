But it was above expectations of $447 million forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.\nIt gave no update on talks with Japan’s SoftBank. The technology investor is in talks to buy a stake in Swiss Re that is unlikely to exceed 10 percent, the reinsurer has said.\nThe world’s second-biggest reinsurer earned more in the first quarter than it did all of last year, when it took a severe hit from a spate of natural disaster’s in North America that cost insurers across the industry a record.\n“We delivered a solid set of results across the board in the first quarter of 2018, as we maintained our underwriting discipline while expanding in an improving, yet still challenging, re/insurance pricing environment,” Chief Executive Christian Mumenthaler said.\nGross written premiums were up 13.1 percent in the quarter, at $11.5 billion, better than the $10.6 billion expected by analysts and above $10.2 billion a year ago.
