On Monday, news broke that HNA is withdrawing its offer to acquire the fund company.\n\"Frankly we see China as a huge growth opportunity as business people, and we're very excited to get a foot on the ground in China,\" Scaramucci added. He said the joint venture falls outside the purview of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\nThe committee's increased scrutiny of foreign acquisitions led to delays in closing HNA's deal to purchase Scaramucci's ownership in SkyBridge last year. The move came as the investor was preparing to join the White House as communications director, a position he held for only 10 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T19:52:43.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
