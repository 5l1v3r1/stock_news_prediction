The first five cities represent the five most populous metro areas, and Miami has the most plastic surgeons per capita.\nThe study team considered a review to be positive if it had four or five stars on Google or Yelp, or a “Worth It” rating on RealSelf. One or two stars or a “Not Worth It” rating were considered negative reviews.\nPositive reviews tended to cite good aesthetic outcome, good bedside manner, friendly staff and expertise as the top reasons for patient satisfaction. Only 37 reviews listed reasonable cost as a positive factor. On the other hand, the top reasons for negative reviews were poor aesthetic outcome, surgeon non-competence, the surgeon not acknowledging or taking responsibility for poor outcomes and the procedure being too expensive.\n“There is a stark difference between a surgeon who has thousands of surgeries and years of experience and a limited online or social media presence and an internet-savvy surgeon with a plethora of reviews who just started a practice,” Kim said.\nOn average, ratings were higher on Google than on Yelp. For unknown reasons, about 37 percent of negative Yelp reviews were from people who didn’t receive surgery from the surgeon they reviewed.\nNegative reviews tended to have higher word counts and were more visible, the authors note. These reviews are difficult for surgeons to contest, they write, in part because healthcare privacy rules prevent discussing details of the case.\n“As reviews have become more relevant, the strategy is often to flood out negative reviews with good ones,” said Dr. Terence Myckatyn of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, who wasn’t involved in the study.\nIn a recent study of patient-reported outcomes for breast augmentation surgery that either did or did not use 3D computer simulation, Myckatyn and colleagues found that the majority of patients who underwent surgery were happy with their results, and the 3D simulation didn’t seem to make a difference in their patient satisfaction scores.\n“Patients should interpret online reviews in a broad context and take into consideration experience, training, word-of-mouth and in-person consultations,” Myckatyn said in an email. “Make sure you’re comfortable with the interaction, surgery plan and compatibility of personalities.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2I49uFb Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, online May 1, 2018.", "external_links": ["https://bit.ly/2I49uFb"], "published": "2018-05-08T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T21:30:11.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
