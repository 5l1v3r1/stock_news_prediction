Last year, three record hurricanes struck the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, causing billions of dollars in damages.\nYet insurance and reinsurance companies overwhelmingly continue to treat storms as “anomalous rather than correlated to climate change,” the study said.\n“Insurers that ignore climate change will not put away enough money to cover their claims. To re-coup those losses, they’ll have to raise rates or pull coverage from high risk areas,” said lead author Jason Thistlethwaite, an assistant professor of environment and business at the University of Waterloo.\nThey will face whopping payouts associated with disasters, he said.\n“When this shift happens, thousands of people will lose coverage or it will be unaffordable,” he said.\nInsured losses had hit an all-time high between 2004 and 2014, according to a 2015 analysis by reinsurer Swiss Re. Insurance companies use reinsurance to minimize their risk.\nBut in 2015, only 3 percent out of a sample of 178 U.S. property insurers and reinsurers were taking into account climate change in corporate governance, underwriting and investment, the study found.\nHowever, the number of companies factoring in climate change in at least one area of operation doubled to about three dozen from 2012 to 2015, it said.\nWith storm-related payouts soaring, insurance companies may go out of business or lose investors, Thistlethwaite said.\nA shrinking insurance market will drive up costs to consumers, he said.\nThe researchers analyzed insurers in California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New York, Washington and New Mexico.\nLess than a month away, the Atlantic hurricane season has been predicted to be “above average” by Colorado State University meteorologists. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
