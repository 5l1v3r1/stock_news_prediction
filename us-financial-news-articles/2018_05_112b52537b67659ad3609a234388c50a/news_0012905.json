In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core business.\nAlthough investors frequently use non-GAAP financial measures in their evaluations of companies, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthe non-GAAP measures do not consider the expense related to stock-based compensation, which is an ongoing expense for the Company; although amortization of internal-use software is a non-cash charge, the assets being amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP income (loss) per share do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements; excluding certain expenses associated with litigation in the quarter or fiscal year does not reflect the impact on our ongoing operations over this period of the cash requirement to defend such or other litigation; excluding restructuring charges in the quarter or fiscal year does not reflect the cash requirement relating to the costs associated with restructuring and primarily relates to employee termination costs and benefits; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider non-GAAP financial measures only together with other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and other GAAP results.\nWe have provided a description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the Company’s historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and we encourage investors to review the reconciliation.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP guidance measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges that we exclude from these non-GAAP measures.\nAbout Aerohive Networks\nAerohive (NYSE: HIVE) enables our customers to simply and confidently connect to the information, applications, and insights they need to thrive.
