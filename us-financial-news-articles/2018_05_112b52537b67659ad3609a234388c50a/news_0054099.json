However, in today’s dynamic environment where new devices, cloud resources and other assets can join, depart and move within a network at any moment, it can be difficult to achieve full cyber situational awareness. Security teams often struggle to identify all assets on their network and understand how they are connected and how they communicate in real-time. And, for enterprises and government agencies with large-scale network operations that extend into the cloud, this challenge is significantly magnified.\nLumeta’s technology solves this problem by discovering, mapping and analyzing all enterprise connectivity, both on-premise and in the cloud. This continuous identification of new devices, routers, cloud connectivity and more, enables FireMon customers to extend the capabilities of the FireMon platform to previously unknown network elements and cloud resources. This reduces enterprise attack surfaces and exposes elements and activity that represent a security risk.\nThe addition of Lumeta’s technology advances FireMon’s mission: to improve security through the implementation of intent-based security. Intent-based security bridges the traditional gap between business and security by enabling business owners and DevOps teams to determine the business intent of applications (and the related security and compliance requirements) and automating the generation of rules required to enforce that intent. The FireMon platform accomplishes this by translating business language to the language spoken by the variety of firewalls, UTMs, load balancers, etc. in corporate environments. This results in more effective and compliant security, while allowing DevOps teams to focus on growing the business.\nLumeta’s technology will enable FireMon customers to extend intent-based security to on-premise and cloud assets that were previously unknown and ensure the right security measures are in place in an automated way utilizing an organization’s existing security infrastructure. This will result in significantly improved security without adding an operational burden on security teams.\nThe acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed within the second quarter of 2018. Upon closing of the transaction, FireMon intends to continue operating Lumeta as a stand-alone business, while infusing additional resources to accelerate Lumeta’s continued technology development and integration with FireMon. Reggie Best will continue as Lumeta’s president and serve on the Executive Leadership team at FireMon.\nQuote: S\n“Lumeta and FireMon share a vision for deeper integration across the security industry. For example, Lumeta built Spectre with two-way RESTful APIs, which has resulted in proven integrations with leading security vendors, including McAfee ePO, IBM QRadar, Carbon Black, Cisco, Tenable, InfoBlox and Qualys. This pairs well with FireMon’s vendor-agnostic approach to solving customers’ problems. Additionally, Lumeta’s history, which dates back to the legendary innovation center Bell Labs, perfectly complements FireMon’s business model and technology strategy.” – Satin Mirchandani, chief executive officer (CEO), FireMon\n“Companies typically face two major security challenges: 1) identifying the applications and assets on their network and 2) solving the people and process issues that lead to security vulnerabilities. The Lumeta acquisition provides a path for customers to discover previously unknown, rogue and shadow IT networks and assets, and then leverage FireMon’s capabilities to manage policies and implement security controls across heterogeneous security infrastructure. Together, FireMon and Lumeta provide a powerful one-two punch that results in more effective and efficient security that reduces risk while providing stronger compliance.” – Satin Mirchandani, CEO, FireMon\n“We look forward to working with FireMon to help its significant customer base overcome traditional challenges associated with network visibility, security policy compliance and securing today’s hybrid cloud environments. We are also honored to be joining the Insight Venture Partners portfolio of companies, which has included Tenable, Docker, Veeam, Mimecast and SolarWinds.” – Reggie Best, president and chief product officer, Lumeta\nAbout FireMon\nThe FireMon platform delivers continuous security for hybrid enterprises through a powerful fusion of vulnerability management, continuous compliance and orchestration.
