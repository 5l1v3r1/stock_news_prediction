She was beaten 3-6 6-3 6-2 by Estonian Anett Kontaveit.\nWorld number four Elina Svitolina and former world number one Karolina Pliskova, however, eased to victories.\nUkrainian Svitolina, the fourth seed, struck 28 winners and lost her serve just once as she brushed Alize Cornet aside for a 6-2 6-2 victory.\nSvitolina is aiming to win her third title of the year but the 23-year-old has never progressed past the second round in Madrid.\nSixth seed Pliskova, coming off a Stuttgart Open title win last month, extended her winning run to six matches after striking 29 winners and seven aces to sweep past Elena Vesnina 6-4 6-2.\n“I think I could play much better. Some parts were good, but my concentration was up and down. Sometimes, after you win a tournament you feel like everything is going to be easy, and I wasn’t fighting like I was in Stuttgart,” Pliskova said.\n“That’s what I want to improve because my next match will be very tough.”\nThe duo will be joined by French seventh seed Caroline Garcia and Russian Daria Kasatkina in the next stage.\nAmerican 12th-seed CoCo Vandeweghe’s defeat by unseeded Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic was the other upset of the day.\nWorld number one Simona Halep, Race to Singapore leader Caroline Wozniacki and Spaniard Garbine Muguruza will take to the courts for their first round matches on Sunday.
