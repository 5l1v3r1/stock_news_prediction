It earlier criticized the auction terms, saying it was “out of step” with the industry and created “artificial spectrum scarcity.”\nNorling said the partnership with state-owned TOT in the 2300-Mhz spectrum would give it wider and more efficient coverage. For the partnership, DTAC has to pay TOT 4.5 billion baht ($140.27 million) per year until 2025.\nDTAC’s 4G service will initially cover at least 37 provinces in Thailand with national coverage by 2019, he said.\nAnalysts agree saying that DTAC did not have an immediate need to acquire the spectrum given its unfavourable terms.\nHowever, rating agency Fitch said securing the 1800-Mhz spectrum was “crucial” for DTAC because the company had lost market share due to spectrum inferiority.\nNorling, who will leave the firm in September, said DTAC would become a strong competitor in the market but declined to comment on whether the mobile operator could surpass its competitor True Corp and take the no. 2 slot.\nDTAC saw its subscriber base shrinking 10 percent from a year ago to 21.8 million users at the end of its first quarter.\nTrue had a total subscriber base of 27.6 million users as of March 2018.\nDTAC’s shares slipped 1.7 percent against the broader market’s gain of 0.03 percent.
