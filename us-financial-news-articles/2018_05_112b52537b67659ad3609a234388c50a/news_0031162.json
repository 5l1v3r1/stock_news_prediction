The company's committee charter has been updated to include the relevant language as well.\n\"This policy formalizes a practice already in place,\" Amazon said in a statement.\nThe change comes after certain shareholders, led by a group called CtW Investment Group, complained about the company's lack of diversity in its board and senior leadership. In a letter last month , CtW proposed adopting a \"Rooney Rule,\" which would require the company to include women and minority candidates in the pool from which directors are chosen.\nAmazon's board had initially opposed the proposal, writing in a proxy filing that the company already \"seeks out candidates with a diversity of experience and perspectives, including diversity with respect to race, gender, geography, and areas of expertise.\"\nAmazon currently has 3 women on its 10-member board. The company's leadership has historically lacked female representation, as CNBC previously reported .\nCtW Investment Group's representative wasn't immediately available for comment.\nshow chapters Closing the gender pay gap 7:02 AM ET Tue, 10 April 2018 | 01:18", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:11:39.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
