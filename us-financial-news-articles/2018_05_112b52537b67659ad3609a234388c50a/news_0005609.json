Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (defined below) was $.17 in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $.10 in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating profit rose to $34.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $27.8 million in the same period of 2017, principally driven by strong digital subscription revenues, which were partially offset by higher operating costs and lower print advertising revenues. Adjusted operating profit (defined below) increased to $55.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $50.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nMark Thompson, president and chief executive officer, The New York Times Company, said, “In the first quarter, we saw increases in revenue and overall profitability and continued solid growth in our digital subscription business. The strong demand for the high quality, independent journalism that The Times produces resulted in a 139,000 net increase in digital-only subscriptions for the quarter. We’re seeing good retention of new cohorts of subscribers and continue to believe there is a big opportunity to further grow this increasingly important part of our business. Subscription revenues accounted for nearly two-thirds of the Company’s revenues and, as we continue to adapt our subscription model and introduce new products, we expect that trend to continue.\n“Turning to advertising, Q1 saw a good performance in print, the best since the third quarter of 2015, with just a 2 percent decline year-over-year. However, as predicted, we had a subdued start to year in digital advertising, with a 6 percent decline in the quarter, driven in part by the lumpiness of our growing strategic partnership business, and the fact that audiences in the quarter, while strong, did not quite reach the peaks of the immediate post-election and inauguration period a year earlier. We expect another down quarter in digital advertising in Q2, but are confident that we will return to solid year-over-year growth in the third quarter.”\nComparisons\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are for the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-07 Compensation— Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The Company has recast its first quarter 2017 results to reflect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-07 for comparability purposes; there was no impact to first quarter 2017 net income as a result of the adoption. Refer to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for more details.\nThis release presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, including diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance, non-operating retirement costs and special items (or adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations); operating profit before depreciation, amortization, severance, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs and special items (or adjusted operating profit); and operating costs before depreciation, amortization, severance and multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs (or adjusted operating costs). Refer to Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information in the exhibits for a discussion of management’s reasons for the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nIn connection with the adoption of ASU 2017-07 in the first quarter of 2018, the Company modified its definitions of adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating costs and non-operating retirement costs in response to changes in the GAAP presentation of single employer pension and postretirement benefit costs. For comparability purposes, the Company has also presented each of its non-GAAP financial measures for the first quarter of 2017 and the full year 2017 reflecting the recast of its financial statements for such periods to account for the adoption of ASU 2017-07 and the revised definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures. In the revised full year 2017 presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, the Company’s adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by $.04 from $.80 to $.76, its adjusted operating costs increased by $9.7 million, and its adjusted operating profit decreased by the same amount, in each case compared to the previously reported amounts. Refer to Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information in the exhibits for more details.\nFirst-quarter 2018 results included the following special items:\nA $1.9 million charge ($1.4 million after tax or $.01 per share) in connection with the redesign and consolidation of space in our headquarters building.\nFirst-quarter 2017 results included the following special items:\nA $2.4 million pre-tax expense ($1.4 million after tax or $.01 per share) related to the redesign and consolidation of space in our headquarters building.\nThe Company had severance costs of $2.4 million ($1.8 million after tax or $.01 per share) and $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax or $.01 per share) in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nResults from Continuing Operations\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 3.8 percent to $413.9 million from $398.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Subscription revenues increased 7.5 percent, while advertising revenues decreased 3.4 percent and other revenues increased 5.0 percent.\nSubscription revenues in the first quarter of 2018 rose primarily due to growth in recent quarters in the number of subscriptions to the Company’s digital-only products. Revenue from the Company’s digital-only subscription products (which include our news product, as well as our Crossword and Cooking products) increased 25.8 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017, to $95.4 million.\nPaid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 2,783,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2018, a net increase of 139,000 subscriptions compared with the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and a 25.5 percent increase compared with the end of the first quarter of 2017. Of the 139,000 additions, 99,000 came from the Company’s digital news products, while the remainder came from the Company’s Cooking and Crossword products.\nFirst-quarter digital advertising revenue decreased 6.0 percent, while print advertising revenue decreased 1.8 percent. Digital advertising revenue was $46.7 million, or 37.2 percent of total Company advertising revenues, compared with $49.7 million, or 38.2 percent, in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in digital advertising revenue reflected a continued decrease in traditional website display advertising, which more than offset increases in revenue from smartphone advertising.\nOther revenues rose 5.0 percent in the first quarter largely due to affiliate referral revenue associated with the product review and recommendation website, Wirecutter and commercial printing revenue, which was partially offset by a decline in our live events business.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs increased in the first quarter of 2018 to $378.0 million compared with $368.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, largely due to higher compensation costs, which was partially offset by lower print production and distribution costs. Adjusted operating costs increased to $358.5 million from $348.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nRaw materials costs were $16.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, flat to the same period in the prior year, as volume declines were mostly offset by higher prices.\nOther Data\nOther Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs/(Income)\nOther components of net periodic benefit costs/(income) increased $3.2 million primarily due to lower expected returns on pension assets partially offset by lower interest costs.\nInterest Expense and Other, net\nInterest expense and other, net decreased in the first quarter of 2018 to $4.9 million compared with $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of higher interest income from cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company had income tax expense of $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate which took effect in 2018, and a tax benefit from stock-based compensation.\nLiquidity\nAs of April 1, 2018, the Company had cash and marketable securities of approximately $749.3 million (excluding restricted cash of approximately $18.1 million, substantially all of which is set aside to collateralize certain workers’ compensation obligations). Included within marketable securities is approximately $63 million of securities used as collateral for letters of credit issued by the Company in connection with the leasing of floors in our headquarters building. Total debt and capital lease obligations were approximately $251.1 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $19 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The expenditures were primarily related to improvements at our College Point printing and distribution facility and the ongoing redesign and consolidation of space in our headquarters building.\nOutlook\nTotal subscription revenues in the second quarter of 2018 are expected to increase in the mid-single digits compared to the second quarter of 2017.\nTotal advertising revenues in the second quarter of 2018 are expected to decrease in the low-teens compared with the second quarter of 2017.\nOperating costs are expected to increase in the low-single digits, while adjusted operating costs are expected to increase in the mid-single digits in the second quarter of 2018 compared with the second quarter of 2017.\nThe Company expects the following on a pre-tax basis in 2018:\nDepreciation and amortization: $60 million to $65 million, Interest expense and other, net: $18 million to $21 million, and Capital expenditures: $60 million to $70 million.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company’s first-quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call will be held on Thursday, May 3 at 11:00 a.m. E.T.

The Company has recast the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the first quarter of 2017 to conform with the current period presentation. This resulted in $0.1 million and $1.1 million of credits being reclassified from “Production costs” and “Selling, general and administrative costs” to “Other components of net periodic benefit costs/(income)” in the first quarter of 2017. This recast increased first quarter 2017 “Operating costs” by $1.2 million while “Operating profit” decreased by the same amount. There was no impact to net income.\n(e)\nThe Company recognized $1.9 million and $2.4 million pre-tax expenses related to the redesign and consolidation of space in our headquarters building in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nIn this release, the Company has referred to non-GAAP financial information with respect to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance, non-operating retirement costs and special items (or adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations); operating profit before depreciation, amortization, severance, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs and special items (or adjusted operating profit); and operating costs before depreciation, amortization, severance and multiemployer pension withdrawal costs (or adjusted operating costs). The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures because management reviews them on a regular basis and uses them to evaluate and manage the performance of the Company’s operations. Management believes that, for the reasons outlined below, these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors as a supplement to reported diluted earnings/(loss) per share from continuing operations, operating profit/(loss) and operating costs. However, these measures should be evaluated only in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measures and should not be viewed as alternative or superior measures of GAAP results.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-07 during the first quarter of 2018, all single employer pension and other postretirement benefit expenses with the exception of service cost were reclassified from operating costs to “Other components of net periodic benefit costs/(income)”. See note (d) to the Footnotes to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations above. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2017-07, the Company made the following changes to its non-GAAP financial measures in order to align them with the new GAAP presentation:\nRevised the components of non-operating retirement costs to include amortization of prior service credit of single employer pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. Revised the definition of adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating costs to exclude only multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs (which historically have been and continue to be a component of non-operating retirement costs), rather than all non-operating retirement costs. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-07 non-operating retirement costs other than multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs are now separately presented outside of operating costs and accordingly have no impact on operating profit and cost under GAAP, or adjusted operating profit or adjusted operating costs. Multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs remain in GAAP operating costs and therefore continue to be an adjustment to these non-GAAP measures.\nNon-operating retirement costs include (i) interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and loss components and amortization of prior service credits of single employer pension expense, (ii) interest cost, amortization of actuarial gains and loss components and amortization of prior service credits of retirement medical expense, and (iii) all multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs.\nThese non-operating retirement costs are primarily tied to financial market performance and changes in market interest rates and investment performance. Management considers non-operating retirement costs to be outside the performance of the business and believes that presenting adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding non-operating retirement costs and presenting adjusted operating results excluding multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs, in addition to the Company’s GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and GAAP operating results, provide increased transparency and a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s operating business performance.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share provides useful information in evaluating the Company’s period-to-period performance because it eliminates items that the Company does not consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. Adjusted operating profit is useful in evaluating the ongoing performance of the Company’s business as it excludes the significant non-cash impact of depreciation and amortization as well as items not indicative of ongoing operating activities. Total operating costs include depreciation, amortization, severance and multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs. Total operating costs excluding these items provide investors with helpful supplemental information on the Company’s underlying operating costs that is used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nManagement considers special items, which may include impairment charges, pension settlement charges and other items that arise from time to time, to be outside the ordinary course of our operations. Management believes that excluding these items provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s operating performance and allows more accurate comparisons of the Company’s operating results to historical performance. In addition, management excludes severance costs, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, because it believes these costs do not necessarily reflect expected future operating costs and do not contribute to a meaningful comparison of the Company’s operating results to historical performance.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are set out in the tables below.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nReconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance, non-operating retirement costs and special items (or adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations)\nFirst Quarter 2018 2017 (1) % Change Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 0.13 $ 0.08 62.5% Add: Severance 0.01 0.01 —% Non-operating retirement costs 0.02 0.01 100.0% Special items: Headquarters redesign and consolidation 0.01 0.01 —% Income tax expense of adjustments (0.01) (0.01) —% Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (2) $ 0.17 $ 0.10 70.0% (1)\nRevised to reflect recast of GAAP results to conform with current period presentation and the revised definition of non-operating retirement costs.

For comparability purposes, the Company has presented each of its non-GAAP financial measures for the first quarter of 2017 and the full year 2017 reflecting the recast of its financial statements for such periods to account for the adoption of ASU 2017-07 and the revised definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures.
