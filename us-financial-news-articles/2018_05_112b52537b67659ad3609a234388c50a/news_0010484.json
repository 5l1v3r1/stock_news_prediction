Thanks to a rise in the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar in recent weeks, the proposed bid is now worth A$6.64.\nSantos on Thursday also said it would sell its non-core Asian assets to London-listed Ophir Energy Plc ( OPHR.L ) for $221 million, and said it plans to restart paying dividends if business trends and oil price gains are sustained.\nUnder the Ophir Energy deal, the firm will exit Vietnam, Malaysia and Bangladesh. Funds from the sale will be used to help pay down debt, which stood at $2.5 billion at the end of March.\nSantos said its share of production from the assets being sold in first quarter of 2018 was 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent.\nThe company said it expects to meet its target to reduce debt to $2 billion early in the second half of 2018, more than a year ahead of plan, which should help it revive its dividend.\n“If the performance of the business continues on this trend and current oil price levels are sustained, the Board will look to restore dividends based on 2018 financial results,” Spence told shareholders.\nReporting by Devika Syamnath and Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:00:50.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
