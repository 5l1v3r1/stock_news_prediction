In recent weeks, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani , who had recently joined Trump's legal team, revealed on Hannity's program that the president had reimbursed his personal attorney, Michael Cohen , for a $130,000 payment intended to secure porn star Stormy Daniels ' silence about an alleged affair with Trump.\nTrump had previously denied knowledge of Cohen's payment as part of the nondisclosure agreement she signed in October 2016. Cohen had told The New York Times that the money came from his own pocket, and that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign were involved.\nIn court proceedings surrounding materials seized from Cohen in federal agents' raids in April, it was revealed that Hannity was one of Cohen's clients between 2017 and 2018. Fox News gave Hannity its full support in a statement shortly after the link was made known.\nThe full report of Hannity's relationship to the president can be found on New York Magazine's website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:52:28.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
