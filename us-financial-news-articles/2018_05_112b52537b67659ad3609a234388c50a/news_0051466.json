They replace Barry Erdos, Peter Longo, Pierre-Andre Mestre and Melissa Payner-Gregor, who is currently interim chief executive officer.\nThe vote marks the first time in recent corporate history that a majority of women dissident directors have won a proxy contest.\nBut the bitter fight between the company and the activists also illustrated how difficult it can be to get women onto boards after Institutional Shareholders Services, a prominent proxy adviser, did not back the dissidents. ISS expressed concern that the proposed directors had no public board experience.\nActivists Nathan Miller and Peter O’Malley, who own roughly 9 percent of the company, have spent months pushing for the company to improve operations and argued that the maternity clothing company needs more gender diversity. Since September, there has been significant turmoil in the executive suite after Anthony Romano stepped down as CEO. He has been succeeded by two interim CEOs.\nThe company’s stock price, which had tumbled some 30 percent over the last 52 weeks, climbed 6.6 percent to close at $2.90.\nOver the last five years, the stock has fallen from roughly $30 a share.\nLarge investors in Destination Maternity include Royce & Associates, Renaissance Technologies, and the Vanguard Group.\n“In our view, new independent voices and greater diversity will be a tremendous asset for the Company and we are very pleased with the result of this election,” Miller said in a statement.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Dan Grebler and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T01:07:01.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
