Personally I think that would be insane. Let’s just hope that doesn’t happen,” Kermode, who is also the ATP’s executive chairman, told BBC Sport.\n“... Davis Cup is a sports entity that has been around for hundreds of years and we value it.\n“Equally the World Team Cup was an event we had for 35 years. It’s been off the shelf for a while, but could we bring that back? I think there’s clearly a demand for a huge team event that anyone can buy into.”\nHe said the ATP and ITF had held talks but failed to find a solution so far. The 53-year-old believes that the decision over which tournament goes ahead will be based on the players’ support for either.
