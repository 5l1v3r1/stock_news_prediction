It did not provide further details.\nThe drugmaker has been expanding rapidly outside its home base of South Africa, where a heavily regulated pharmaceuticals market has put a cap on growth.\nAspen, which in March reported a 26 percent rise in first-half earnings helped by its therapeutic focused brands, said it had secured the revolving credit facility from 28 banks internationally. It is structured across the euro, the South African rand and the Australian dollar with tenors of two to four years and a one-year extension option.\nThe firm makes branded and generic pharmaceutical products, as well as infant nutritional and consumer healthcare products. $1 = 0.8480 euros Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Susan Fenton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:21:56.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
