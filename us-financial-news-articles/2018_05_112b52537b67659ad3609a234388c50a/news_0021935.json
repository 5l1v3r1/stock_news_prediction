However, we will have to wait and see what exactly President Trump says tonight,” the diplomat, who declined to be named, said.\nBritish foreign minister Boris Johnson visited the United States over the weekend to lobby officials and try to save the deal, saying he was certain that its shortcomings could be remedied.\nEuropean leaders have warned that Trump’s withdrawal would strike a blow to the alliance between Western Europe and the United States, and undo years of negotiations that they say were successful in halting Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\n“Our objective will remain to uphold and maintain the JCPOA (the nuclear deal). We will need to wait to understand what the US plan is to deliver on our shared goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and addressing their regional behavior,” the diplomat said.\nReporting by William James; editing by Michael Holden\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:46:29.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
