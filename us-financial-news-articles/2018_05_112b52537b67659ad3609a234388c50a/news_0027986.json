This is the basic point...we cannot continue in the same way.\n“We think we should restructure the business model. This could be track rental, but it could be also sharing of ticket income and sharing of costs.”\nHockenheim receives no state funding whereas other countries with little or no motorsport heritage — like Azerbaijan, Singapore and Abu Dhabi — pay tens of millions of dollars to host races.\nWith Miami likely to debut next year, and Vietnam in the pipeline as well as Danish backers proposing a race in Copenhagen, Liberty have plenty of options.\n“It’s a financial decision they have to take,” said Teske. “Do they take the big money, let’s say? Then we are out. Or do they believe in the importance of the traditional racetracks and an important automotive country, Germany?\n“Now it’s up to them to think about and find a solution together with us.”\nIn the recent past, Hockenheim alternated with the Nuerburgring — another historic circuit dating from before World War Two but one which has had financial problems and changed ownership.\nTeske said a revived alternation would work well but Hockenheim, home for champions Mercedes and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, would be prepared to go it alone if the deal was right.\n“We don’t know what they (Nuerburgring) have discussed with Liberty but what we know is they have the same objective as we have. They don’t want to lose money,” added Teske. “And they don’t want to take risks as well.\n“One year them, one year us is clever. It’s good.”\nOrganisers said 60,000 tickets had been sold so far for July’s race, more than in 2016 and around break-even.\nSome 10,000 of them were fans of Red Bull’s Dutch driver Max Verstappen coming over the border.
