Highlights include:\nConsolidated net income of $140.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $114.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2017. Consolidated net financial earnings (NFE), a non-GAAP financial measure, of $142.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $104.1 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 NFE guidance reaffirmed at a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Energy Services continued to deliver strong results, reporting second-quarter fiscal 2018 NFE of $72.8 million, compared with $15.7 million during the same period in fiscal 2017, as a result of strong demand and market volatility due to cold weather during the quarter. NJNG seeks to significantly expand its energy-efficiency programs with its $341 million filing with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).\n“With another impressive performance by Energy Services and a solid performance by New Jersey Natural Gas, fiscal 2018 is shaping up to be a strong year for our company,\" Laurence M. Downes, chairman and CEO of New Jersey Resources, said. \"We will continue to focus on executing our strategy to meet our customers' expectations and deliver results for our shareowners.\"\nSecond-quarter fiscal 2018 net income totaled $140.3 million, or $1.60 per share, compared with $114.7 million, or $1.33 per share, during the same period in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date net income totaled $264 million, or $3.02 per share, compared with $149.6 million, or $1.74 per share, during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, NFE totaled $142.1 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with NFE of $104.1 million, or $1.21 per share, during the same period last year. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date NFE totaled $277.4 million, or $3.18 per share, compared with $144.5 million, or $1.68 per share, during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nA reconciliation of net income to NFE for the three and six months ended March 31 of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended March 31, March 31, (Thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income* $ 140,266 $ 114,702 $ 263,965 $ 149,631 Add: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments and related transactions (11,608 ) (54,855 ) 23,246 (26,553 ) Tax effect 4,716 19,679 (3,343 ) 9,922 Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory 6,125 34,328 (19,262 ) 16,389 Tax effect (1,715 ) (12,334 ) 6,529 (6,130 ) Net income to NFE tax adjustment 4,278 2,586 6,260 1,230 Net financial earnings $ 142,062 $ 104,106 $ 277,395 $ 144,489 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding Basic 87,595 86,275 87,295 86,182 Diluted 87,989 87,101 87,690 86,993 Basic earnings per share $ 1.60 $ 1.33 $ 3.02 $ 1.74 Add: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments and related transactions (0.13 ) (0.64 ) 0.27 (0.31 ) Tax effect 0.05 0.23 (0.04 ) 0.12 Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory 0.07 0.40 (0.22 ) 0.19 Tax effect (0.02 ) (0.14 ) 0.08 (0.07 ) Net income to NFE tax adjustment 0.05 0.03 0.07 0.01 Basic net financial earnings per share $ 1.62 $ 1.21 $ 3.18 $ 1.68 *Results during the first six months of fiscal 2018 include an estimated income tax benefit of $58.5 million, or $0.67 per share, due to the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the reduction in the corporate tax rate.\nNFE is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of the United States. It is a measure of earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses, net of applicable tax adjustments, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas, Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) and foreign currency contracts. NFE eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments in the current period. For further discussion of this financial measure, please see the explanation below under “Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nA table summarizing our key performance metrics for the three and six months ended March 31 of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended March 31, March 31, ($ in Thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income $ 140,266 $ 114,702 $ 263,965 $ 149,631 EPS $ 1.60 $ 1.33 $ 3.02 $ 1.74 NFE 142,062 104,106 $ 277,395 $ 144,489 Basic net financial earnings per share $ 1.62 $ 1.21 $ 3.18 $ 1.68 A table detailing NFE for the three and six months ended March 31 of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended March 31, March 31, (Thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net financial earnings (loss) New Jersey Natural Gas $ 60,442 $ 60,233 $ 94,551 $ 90,581 Midstream 1,315 4,948 18,826 7,335 Subtotal Regulated 61,757 65,181 113,377 97,916 Clean Energy Ventures 10,051 22,743 81,301 25,585 Energy Services 72,832 15,746 93,106 19,233 Home Services and Other (2,488 ) 708 (10,204 ) 2,250 Subtotal Non-Regulated 80,395 39,197 164,203 47,068 Subtotal 142,152 104,378 277,580 144,984 Eliminations (90 ) (272 ) (185 ) (495 ) Total $ 142,062 $ 104,106 $ 277,395 $ 144,489 NJR Reaffirms Fiscal 2018 NFE Guidance:\nNJR reaffirmed fiscal 2018 NFE guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, subject to the identified below under “Forward-Looking Statements.” NJR expects its regulated businesses to generate between 40 to 55 percent of total NFE, with New Jersey Natural Gas (NJNG) continuing to be the largest contributor, excluding the impacts of tax reform. The following chart represents NJR’s current expected contributions from its subsidiaries, and the estimated benefits as a result of the revaluation of deferred taxes due to tax reform for fiscal 2018:\nCompany Expected Fiscal 2018\nNet Financial Earnings Contribution New Jersey Natural Gas 35 to 45 percent Midstream 5 to 10 percent Total Regulated 40 to 55 percent Clean Energy Ventures 5 to 10 percent Energy Services 20 to 30 percent Home Services and Other 1 to 3 percent Total Non-Regulated 26 to 43 percent NFE contribution from the revaluation of deferred taxes due to tax reform 20 to 25 percent In providing fiscal 2018 NFE guidance, management is aware there could be differences between reported GAAP earnings and NFE due to matters such as, but not limited to, the positions of our energy-related derivatives. Management is not able to reasonably estimate the aggregate impact or significance of these items on reported earnings and, therefore, is not able to provide a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance without unreasonable efforts.\nEffective Tax Rate:\nNJR’s estimated annual effective tax rate increased to 17.2 percent in fiscal 2018 from 15.6 percent in fiscal 2017. The increase is due to fewer expected investment tax credits, offset by a reduction in the federal tax rate.\nFor NFE purposes, NJR expects the annual effective tax rate to increase from 12.7 percent to 15.3 percent. NJR recognized $18.4 million in tax credits, net of deferred taxes, during the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with $30 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. Further detail can be found in Note 11 “Income Taxes” within our 10-Q filing.\nRegulated Business Update:\nNew Jersey Natural Gas\nNJNG reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 NFE of $60.4 million, compared with $60.2 million, during the same period in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date NFE at NJNG were $94.6 million, compared with $90.6 million during the same period last year. Increases in NFE for the quarter and fiscal year-to-date were due primarily to customer growth and return on capital expenditures associated with BPU-approved infrastructure projects, offset by increased operation and maintenance expenses.\nCustomer Growth:\nNJNG added 4,656 new customers during the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with 4,130 during the same period last year, primarily driven by the residential new construction market. These new customer additions, and those customers who added additional natural gas services to their premises, are expected to contribute $2.8 million annually to utility gross margin. NJNG expects to add between 26,000 to 28,000 new customers through fiscal 2020, representing an average annual growth rate of 1.7 percent and a cumulative increase in utility gross margin of approximately $16 million. For more information on utility gross margin, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below.\nInfrastructure Update:\nSafety Acceleration and Facilities Enhancement (SAFE) II is a five-year program approved by the BPU in September 2016 designed to replace the remaining 276 miles of unprotected steel main and associated services in NJNG’s distribution system. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, NJNG invested $16.5 million to replace 22 miles of unprotected steel main and services. New Jersey Reinvestment in System Enhancement (NJ RISE) program is a five-year, $102.5 million investment that began in 2014. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, NJNG installed a secondary natural gas distribution main between Brick and Mantoloking, and reinforced a regulator station in Long Beach Island. NJNG expects to complete work on a secondary natural gas distribution main in the southern section of the Seaside barrier island by June 2018. Both the SAFEII and NJ RISE programs are eligible for annual base rate increases. On March 29, 2018, NJNG filed its annual petition with the BPU requesting a base rate change in the amount of $6.9 million for the recovery of capital costs through June 30, 2018. The filing will be updated in July 2018 to reflect the actual results through June 30, 2018, with changes to base rates effective October 1, 2018. The Southern Reliability Link (SRL) , which will provide a secondary interstate feed into the southern end of NJNG’s delivery system, continues to make progress on the remaining easement and road-opening permits. Once obtained, construction will begin. NJNG expects the SRL to be in service during 2019.\nBasic Gas Supply Service Incentive Programs:\nBGSS incentive programs contributed $2.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to utility gross margin, compared with $2.9 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. Fiscal year-to-date, these programs contributed $6.8 million, compared with $6.7 million during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nEnergy Efficiency:\nThe SAVEGREEN Project ® , NJNG’s energy-efficiency program, invested $6.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018 in grants and financing options designed to help customers with energy-efficiency upgrades for their homes and businesses. On March 28, 2018, NJNG submitted a filing with the BPU to significantly expand its energy-efficiency offerings to help more customers save money, manage their energy usage and reduce emissions. Pending BPU approval, NJNG is planning to invest approximately $341 million over the six-year program.\nTax Reform Benefits Customers:\nOn March 26, 2018, the BPU approved NJNG’s filing to pass through the benefits of the federal tax reform and reduce customers’ rates by $21 million, inclusive of sales tax, effective April 1, 2018, resulting in a $31, or a 3 percent, annual decrease for the typical customer. The BPU is reviewing NJNG's request to provide a one-time refund to customers, totaling approximately $31 million. Actual refund amounts will be determined in May and reflect individual customer usage. Customers can expect to see these savings in their May or June bills. When combined, the average customer using 1,000 therms per year will see an estimated overall reduction of $78, or 7.4 percent, this year.\nMidstream\nMidstream reported second-quarter 2018 net financial earnings of $1.3 million, compared with NFE of $4.9 million during the same period in fiscal 2017, and fiscal year-to-date NFE of $18.8 million, compared with $7.3 million during the same period last year. The higher fiscal year-to-date results reflect the benefits of tax reform.\nRegulated infrastructure projects, including the PennEast Pipeline and Adelphia Gateway, continue to move forward. These projects are designed to benefit our customers by providing low-cost natural gas from the Marcellus Shale region and shareowners with a competitive return on their investment. On January 19, 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued PennEast a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. PennEast continues to target an in-service date in 2019; however, the delay in receiving its FERC certificate has affected the timetable for land access, surveys and permit applications, which may delay the commencement of construction to 2019. NJR has adjusted its capital plan to reflect construction commencing in 2019.\nNon-Regulated Business Update:\nEnergy Services\nEnergy Services reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 NFE of $72.8 million, compared with $15.7 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date NFE were $93.1 million, compared with $19.2 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. The significant increase in NFE in both periods was due primarily to colder weather, which resulted in increased storage withdrawals to meet higher demand coupled with higher volatility, that allowed Energy Services to capture additional financial margin from natural gas price spreads.\nClean Energy Ventures\nClean Energy Ventures (CEV) reported NFE of $10.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $22.7 million in the same period in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date NFE were $81.3 million, compared with $25.6 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. The lower quarterly results were due primarily to an expectation of fewer Investment Tax Credits (ITC), compared with the same period in fiscal 2017, as a result of the planned execution of sale leaseback financings for all fiscal 2018 commercial solar projects. The improved fiscal year-to-date results were due primarily to an estimated benefit of $63.1 million related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes. Highlights include:\nOn March 2, 2018, CEV entered into a purchase and sale agreement for its 9.7 megawatt (MW) wind farm in Two Dot, Montana for a total sale price of $18.5 million. The sale is expected to close during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, pending FERC approval. In March 2018, CEV committed to a plan to pursue the sale of its remaining wind assets. CEV is targeting the sale of the remaining wind assets will be completed within the next 12 months. As of March 31, 2018, the company classified its wind assets and liabilities as held for sale. Four commercial solar projects located in Old Bridge, Raritan, South Brunswick and Springfield Townships, New Jersey, totaling 42.9 MWs of capacity, and an approximate investment of $96.4 million, are under construction and CEV expects them to be placed into service during fiscal 2018. Solar-related capital expenditures for The Sunlight Advantage ® projects during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $5.4 million, compared with $11.1 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. The decrease was due primarily to fewer projects placed into service.\nCEV expects total solar-related capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 to be between $132 million and $145 million, of which $96.4 million will utilize sale leaseback financing. This compares with total solar-related capital expenditures of $120.3 million in fiscal 2017, which included $33 million of sale leaseback financing.\nHome Services and Other Operations\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Home Services, the company’s non-regulated retail and appliance service subsidiary, and Other Operations reported a net financial loss of $2.5 million, compared with NFE of $708,000 during the same period last year. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date net financial losses were $10.2 million, compared with NFE of $2.3 million during the same period last year. The fiscal 2018 year-to-date decrease was due to an estimated $10.7 million charge primarily attributed to other operations resulting from the revaluation of deferred income taxes due to tax reform.\nHome Services reported a net financial loss of $1.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with a net financial loss of $1.7 million during the same period last year. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date net financial losses were $5.5 million, compared with net financial loss of $2.5 million during the same period last year. The fiscal year-to-date decrease was due primarily to an estimated $2.8 million charge based on the revaluation of deferred taxes recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to tax reform.\nCapital Expenditures and Cash Flows:\nNJR is committed to maintaining a strong financial profile while continuing to invest capital in regulated and non-regulated projects.\nDuring the first six months of fiscal 2018, NJR generated operating cash flows of $312.5 million, compared with $171.8 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. Fiscal year-to-date capital expenditures were $148.8 million, of which $95.1 million were related to regulated assets, compared with $139.3 million, of which $92.5 million were related to regulated assets, during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nWebcast Information:\nNJR will host a live webcast to discuss its financial results today at 10 a.m. EDT.

The aforementioned factors are detailed in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Form 10-K that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 21, 2017, which is available on the SEC’s Web site at sec.gov . Information included in this release is representative as of today only, and while NJR periodically reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting NJR’s results of operations and financial condition in connection with its preparation of management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contained in its Quarterly and Annual Reports filed with the SEC, NJR does not, by including this statement, assume any obligation to review or revise any particular forward-looking statement referenced herein in light of future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information:\nThis release includes the non-GAAP financial measures NFE (losses), financial margin and utility gross margin. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP can be found below. As an indicator of NJR’s operating performance, these measures should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information has been provided pursuant to the requirements of SEC Regulation G.\nNFE (losses) and financial margin exclude unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments related to the company’s unregulated subsidiaries and certain realized gains and losses on derivative instruments related to natural gas that has been placed into storage at Energy Services, net of applicable tax adjustments as described below. Volatility associated with the change in value of these financial instruments and physical commodity contracts is reported on the income statement in the current period. In order to manage its business, NJR views its results without the impacts of the unrealized gains and losses, and certain realized gains and losses, caused by changes in value of these financial instruments and physical commodity contracts prior to the completion of the planned transaction because it shows changes in value currently instead of when the planned transaction ultimately is settled. An annual estimated effective tax rate is calculated for NFE purposes and any necessary quarterly tax adjustment is applied to Clean Energy Ventures, as such the adjustment is related to tax credits generated by Clean Energy Ventures.\nNJNG’s utility gross margin represents the results of revenues less natural gas costs, sales, expenses and other taxes and regulatory rider expenses, which are key components of NJR’s operations that move in relation to each other. Natural gas costs, sales, expenses and other taxes and regulatory rider expenses are passed through to customers and, therefore, have no effect on gross margin. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures to other GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of NJR’s performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are more reflective of NJR’s business model, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP can be found below. For a full discussion of NJR’s non-GAAP financial measures, please see NJR’s 2017 Form 10-K, Item 7.\nAbout New Jersey Resources\nNew Jersey Resources (NYSE: NJR) is a Fortune 1000 company that, through its subsidiaries, provides safe and reliable natural gas and clean energy services, including transportation, distribution, asset management and home services.
