REUTERS/Neil Hall//File Photo\n“I’m sorry for my poor choice of language in an interview with the Telegraph yesterday and regret the offence caused,” Broadbent said in a statement.\nBroadbent had told the Telegraph that years of poor productivity and weak wage growth meant Britain was going through a “menopausal” moment.

REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo\nHis comments attracted derision in social media.\n“Enough of this pejorative tosh stigmatising women in their prime,” Conservative lawmaker Sarah Wollaston said on Twitter.\n“#Menopause only a problem if others try to sideline you because of ignorant prejudice.”\nRobert Peston, political editor of broadcaster ITV, said the comments were “sloppy, empirically unsound and potentially offensive”.\nIn his apology, Broadbent said he had been trying to explain the word “climacteric”, a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth during the nineteenth century.\n“Economic productivity is something which affects every one of us, of all ages and genders,” he said.
