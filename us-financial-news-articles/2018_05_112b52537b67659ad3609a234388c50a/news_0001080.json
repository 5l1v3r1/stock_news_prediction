Even then, it was Samsung BioLogics’ biggest intra-day drop since its listing in late 2016. The benchmark KOSPI was down 0.3 percent.\nThe FSS said it had begun an investigation into the company as an activist group questioned last year whether the company had breached accounting rules to inflate its net profit before its listing.\nThe country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, will convene meetings to deliberate on the matter before announcing final measures.\nSamsung BioLogics reported a 1.9 trillion won ($1.77 billion) net profit in 2015, compared to a roughly 28 billion won net loss in 2014 and a 62.4 billion won net loss in 2013.\nHowever, the net profit was not a prerequisite for Samsung BioLogics to list in 2016, as the Korea Exchange had instituted new rules allowing companies with growth potential to list despite a net loss, said Seo Keun-hee, analyst at KB Securities.\nShares in Samsung C&T Corp, which held a 43 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, also fell more than 5 percent. Shares of Samsung Elec, which owned a 31.5 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, were on a trading halt on Wednesday ahead of a stock split.\n($1 = 1,073.9000 won)\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T07:18:38.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
