Google entered the market with Google Home -- also available in different models -- and Apple later followed with the HomePod.\nCanalys said on Wednesday that smart speakers are the fastest growing consumer tech segment and that Google Home beat the Amazon Echo in shipments for the first time ever in the first quarter of 2018. Canalys said Google shipped 3.2 million Google Home units to Amazon's 2.5 million Echo shipments.\nThe figures are different from estimates Strategy Analytics published earlier this month. Strategy Analytics still showed that Google made a big dent in Amazon Echo market share, but said Amazon shipped 4 million units while Google shipped 2.4 million Google Homes. Still, that firm noted that Google's market share had doubled from the previous year.\nThe takeaway: there's no clear winner yet, but Google's gaining steam on Amazon quickly. Both research firms said China's a big growth area.\nshow chapters What happens when you ask Alexa, Google and Siri if they are spying on you 4:35 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 00:53", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:52:29.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
