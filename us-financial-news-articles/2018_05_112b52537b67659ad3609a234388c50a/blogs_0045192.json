CPP declined to comment.\nSeveral other companies have made investments in Sao Paulo offices or have expressed interest in investing soon. Buyers include foreign groups such as Brookfield Asset Management Inc , domestic firms such as BR Properties SA and local real estate investment trusts, including funds run by Banco BTG Pactual SA.\nSome assets hitting the market in Sao Paulo in recent months are owned by distressed sellers.\nThe real estate arm of scandal-plagued Odebrecht SA, for example, has agreed in principle to sell a project to Hemisferio Sul Investimentos SA expected to be worth 1.2 billion reais when finished, Reuters reported last month.\nOther assets are owned by international funds that bought into Sao Paulo real estate at its trough and aim to book a profit before Brazil's highly unpredictable October elections.
