Wells found to be leaking will be decommissioned, Mumba said.\nThe agency already has set up observation boreholes to judge how much groundwater levels are decreasing and to measure water contamination in parts of Lusaka, he said.\nThe Zambian government has placed water management on its economic and sustainable development agenda in its seventh national development plan, for the period 2017 to 2021, according to the Ministry of Energy and Water Development.\nThe ministry’s permanent secretary, Ed Chomba, said at a press conference that the borehole charges would cover administrative costs and help regulate water use in the face of climate change.\nThe new rules allow a domestic household to use an average of 10 cubic meters (10,000 liters) of water a day.\nFailure to register a borehole can result in a maximum fine of 30,000 kwacha ($3,000) or imprisonment for up to 12 months, according to the new rules.\nBut an international charity working on water issues in Zambia says more steps need to be taken to regulate consumption and reduce pollution.\nPamela Chisanga of WaterAid Zambia said contamination of water is as big a problem as lack of it in parts of Zambia.\n“For us, the challenge is water contamination before we talk of how much water each household can use,” she said.\nMike Zulu of Lusaka, who owns a borehole, said that when his water was tested it was found to be polluted.\nZulu, who said his household uses considerably less than 5,000 liters of water per day, believes that income from the well licensing program should be used to address increasing levels of water contamination, rather than simply being spent on administration of the program.\n“It would have been better if the funds raised were used to assist borehole owners to deal with polluted water,” he said.\nFEWER DRILLERS, FEWER WELLS? Christopher Chilongo, secretary of the Drillers Association of Zambia, said that the new regulations will help set standards for the construction of new boreholes.\nOnly registered firms with qualified staff are now allow to drill wells.\n“Clearly the groundwater table level keeps on dropping, and we cannot keep on (drilling) holes,” Chilongo said. “Twenty years from now it will be a huge problem if the issue is not addressed now.”\nChilongo said that according to a survey by his association last year, the temperature of groundwater is rising, while the water level is falling in most parts of the country.\nThe Zambian government reported in 2015 that 11 percent of urban residents lacked access to safe drinking water, while almost half the rural population lacked access.\n“As the means of (conserving) groundwater, we are encouraging communities to use communal boreholes in most residential areas. For example, six to nine households can have one borehole to use,” Chilongo said.\nWARMA officials similarly said they hope most domestic boreholes used by single households will eventually be decommissioned in favor of shared wells.\nThis will improve conservation of water and also raise funds, since under the new regulations boreholes used by more than one household can be charged commercial rates, WARMA officials said.\nReporting by Danstan Kaunda ; editing by James Baer and Laurie Goering : Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.
