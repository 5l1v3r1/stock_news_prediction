The White House's decision to push back the tariff deadline in early May, for example, sent shares of rivals U.S. Steel and Nucor down 6 percent and 2 percent respectively.\nHoping to address creeping doubts over the future of the taxes, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports – a key target of the original policy – will stay in place even as the administration suspends separate tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\"As it relates to China, the steel and aluminum tariffs will remain enforced,\" he said. \"Those were not part of our discussions. We were merely focused on the proposed $150 billion.\"\n\"Those are not being touched,\" he added.\nNotwithstanding the assurance from Mnuchin, AK Steel's stock price, which rallied more than 60 percent in the months immediately following President Trump's election, has tumbled back to their pre-election levels above $4.\nWith weaker-than-expected quarterly guidance on pricing and profits, Goldman Sachs believes the stocks could sink further.\nAnalyst Korn cut his 12-month price forecast for the company to $4 from $6, implying 9.5 percent downside from Tuesday's close.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T16:04:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
