They moved after the school stopped using them for research.\nThe cases are In re: Nonhuman Rights Project Inc on behalf of Tommy v Lavery et al, and In re: Nonhuman Rights Project Inc on behalf of Kiko v Presti et al, New York Court of Appeals, Motion No. 2018-268.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T18:50:37.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
