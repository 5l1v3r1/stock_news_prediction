However, the Statis and two of their companies – Ascom Group S.A. and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd - have won an international arbitration award of around $500 million against the Kazakh government.\nKazakhstan has refused to pay, accusing Stati of using fraudulent means to secure a favorable arbitration ruling and filing lawsuits against him. The Statis, in turn, filed enforcement lawsuits in several European countries which led to large-scale Kazakh asset freezes last year.\nThe case before the High Court of Justice in London was one of those enforcement lawsuits. Kazakhstan chose to contest it, bringing up fraud allegations - which the Statis deny.\nIn February, the Statis asked the court to discontinue the proceedings, citing, among other reasons, the fact they had secured “attachments of Kazakhstan’s assets to the tune of $28 billion in other jurisdictions which made the English proceedings redundant”.\nHowever, in a March 26 judgment published on Friday, the court set aside their notice of discontinuance, saying the matter must proceed to trial in October as previously scheduled.\n“We are confident that justice will eventually be served,” Kazakh Justice Minister Marat Beketayev said in a statement.\nA spokeswoman for Stati said in an email that “the Stati Parties will be seeking permission to appeal the judgment,” describing the court’s decision as flawed.
