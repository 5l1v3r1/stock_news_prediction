They need to be created,\" said Morgan. \"I'm fortunate that Vortex can offer such a broad range of trenchless solutions, because it makes my job a little bit easier,\" she added.\nVortex doesn't plan on changing Morgan's approach in her new role, where she will be charged with creating and expanding business opportunities in the Southeast, as recent acquisition VacVision Environmental is turning on all cylinders. \"Casey's ability to develop lasting business relationships and nurture strategic partnerships has been exceptional,\" stated Andrew Gonnella, EVP Sales & Marketing for the Vortex Companies. \"Casey has proven herself and we are excited to have the Southeast sales team led by her.
