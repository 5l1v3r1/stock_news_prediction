We would be very happy to see you,” Lavrov, seated across a table from Kim, said during a televised meeting.\nHe expressed Moscow’s support for a declaration last month in which North and South Korea agreed to work for the denuclearisation of the peninsula.\nHe said Moscow hoped all sides would take a measured approach to possible forthcoming talks on a nuclear settlement.

KCNA/via REUTERS\n“This will allow for the realisation not only of the denuclearisation of the whole Korean peninsula but also to provide sustainable peace and stability across north-east Asia,” Lavrov was quoted as saying by his ministry.\nKim’s personal meeting with Lavrov was likely a move to try to secure Russia - along with China - as another powerful player that can push the United States to ease sanctions and make other concessions, said Anthony Rinna, a specialist in Korea-Russia relations at Sino-NK, a website that analyses the region.\nIn the short term, Moscow “cannot afford to be remembered as the country that had no hat in the ring leading up to June 12,” he said.\n“From a longer-term perspective, Russia hopes to foster economic cooperation with both North and South Korea.”\nKim would be wise to delay any official visit to Russia until after his meeting with Trump, said Jeong Hyung-gon, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.
