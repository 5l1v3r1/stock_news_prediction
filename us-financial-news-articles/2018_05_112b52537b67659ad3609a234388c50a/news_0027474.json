Quebec and British Columbia saw the biggest increases, as builders also planned row houses.\nBut building plans for single-family homes fell 7.9 percent as Toronto tumbled for the second month in a row. The Ontario government took a number of steps to rein in the hot Toronto housing market last year.\nPermits for non-residential structures rose 4.5 percent, recovering some of the previous month’s decline as builders planned more commercial buildings.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:50:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
