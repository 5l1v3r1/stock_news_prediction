Last week it hit a record low of 4.9290, prompting an emergency central bank hike in its highest rate by 3 percentage points to 16.5 percent.\nThe lira is currently down some 17 percent against the dollar this year.\nOn Monday, the bank said the repo rate would be set at 16.5 percent and would once again be regarded as the main rate under a new framework taking effect on June 1.\nThe bank has for years used multiple rates to set borrowing costs, creating a complex system that economists say has made policy less predictable. Adding to their concerns, Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates” has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs to boost credit and construction.\nSimsek said overnight that he and Cetinkaya would meet 90 portfolio managers, bank executives and analysts in groups between 7 am (0600 GMT) and 10 pm in London.\n“We are making intensive efforts for Turkey’s positive decoupling with our decisive police steps, good communication and our strong long-term story,” Simsek wrote on Twitter.
