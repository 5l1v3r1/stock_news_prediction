At this point, consistent with MLB’s policy, Bae is permitted to participate in baseball activities during this review.”\nThe Pirates made Bae the second-largest international signing in franchise history, signing him for $1.2 million in March. Bae batted .474 in 27 games for Kyeongbuk High School and won the Lee Young-min Batting Award as the top high school hitter in South Korea last year.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T01:18:47.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
