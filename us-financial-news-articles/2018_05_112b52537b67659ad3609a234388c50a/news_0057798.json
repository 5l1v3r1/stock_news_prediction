He also had a hit for the second time in his two games.\nPittsburgh closer Felipe Vazquez, who had failed to convert on his past three save opportunities, gave up two hits in a scoreless ninth for his 10th save.\nKyle Hendricks (4-4) pitched five strong innings for Chicago, allowing two runs and seven hits, with one strikeout and one walk. He has allowed three or fewer earned runs in each of his past nine starts dating to April 12.\nThe Cubs took a quick 1-0 lead after Albert Almora Jr. opened the game with a double to left-center. Javier Baez followed with a single to bring home Almora.\nPittsburgh tied it in the bottom of the first when Harrison hit his sixth career leadoff homer, to right. It was his second this season.\nIn the second, the Pirates’ Corey Dickerson stretched a hit to the corner in left into a triple, putting him in position an out later to score on Gregory Polanco’s sacrifice fly for a 2-1 lead.\nThe benches and bullpens emptied in the third. Musgrove led off with a single, and on Harrison’s subsequent grounder, Baez, the pivot at second, took exception to Musgrove’s slide to break up a double play.\nBaez barked heatedly at Musgrove, and all the players poured onto the field. There were no punches thrown or pushes.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
