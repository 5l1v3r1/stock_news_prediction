CSC is the parent company of Delaware Place Bank, an Illinois state-chartered bank, which operates a banking location in the Gold Coast/Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. As of March 31, 2018, Delaware Place Bank had approximately $245 million in assets, approximately $165 million in loans and approximately $215 million in deposits.\nEdward J. Wehmer, President and CEO of Wintrust, said, “This transaction provides a wonderful opportunity to expand and complement our market presence in the heart of the City of Chicago. We look forward to continuing the community banking approach that Delaware Place Bank has established and to providing its customers with an expanded array of products, services and resources.”\n“We are very pleased with the opportunity to join the Wintrust banking family,” said James W. Aldrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chicago Shore Corporation and Delaware Place Bank. “This transaction brings together two companies that share core community banking philosophies and cultures. Wintrust’s Chicago-based leadership and its track record of serving families, individuals and businesses in Chicago’s neighborhoods and surrounding communities made it an attractive partner. This partnership offers our customers and employees the long-term benefits that being part of a successful, growing and caring organization brings.” Mr. Aldrich emphasized that by joining forces with Wintrust, “the transaction allows us to continue focusing on serving our customers, while at the same time providing our customers with access to a wider range of products, services and resources.

The transaction is expected to close late in the third quarter 2018, and is not expected to have a material effect on Wintrust’s 2018 earnings per share.\nAdvisors\nPiper Jaffray acted as exclusive financial advisor to CSC in the transaction and provided a fairness opinion to its Board of Directors.
