Supporters say these state-authorized, tax-advantaged savings accounts will help would-be homeowners reach their goal. CNBC.com\nSaving up to buy a house can now get you a tax break.\nAcross the country, state legislatures are authorizing \"first-time home buyer savings accounts,\" which come with varying tax advantages. Oregon and Alabama recently joined about a half-dozen other states that have passed bills creating these options in recent years. Others are actively considering them.\n\"The accounts are designed to provide renters with a tax-advantaged opportunity to save for their down payment,\" said Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst for the Tax Foundation.\n\"In some states, it's not just for first-time buyers, but for those who haven't owned a home in a number of years,\" Walczak said.

Last year, the share stood at 32 percent, according to a 2017 survey by the National Association of Realtors. That's lower than the long-term average of 40 percent.\n\"That's statistically important,\" said Todd Umbenhauer, president of the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors. \"Far fewer first-time home buyers are entering the market.\"\nIn Umbenhauer's state, there is bipartisan support for pending legislation that would create the tax-advantaged accounts.\nSpecifically, first-time homebuyers or people re-entering the housing market in Pennsylvania would be able to put up to $50,000 over 10 years in a designated account. Yearly contributions — which would be tax-deductible on state returns — would be limited to $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for married couples who file joint tax returns. Earnings also would be tax-free.

Savers could open an account and name themselves or someone else the beneficiary.\nLike other states' programs, there would penalties for not using the money in a specified time, and the funds would be subject to other rules governing things like transferring the account to another bank.\nIn other words, these accounts operate similarly to 529 college savings plans , including the stipulation that the funds must be used only for qualified expenses. For example, a down payment and closing costs are among the home-buying costs that would be fair game.\nNationally, the median home price — half are above, half below — stood at $250,400 in March, up 5.8 percent from $236,600 a year earlier, according to recent data from the National Association of Realtors. show chapters 10:17 AM ET Tue, 15 May 2018 | 01:04\nWhile putting 20 percent down at that price to avoid paying mortgage insurance would mean coming up with $50,800, many homebuyers get into a home with much less. Additionally, there are government programs that can financially assist would-be homeowners.\nSupporters of the first-time home buyer savings accounts say factors like rising home prices and debt — often of the student loan variety — stand in the way of homeownership and these programs will help. Others question whether they will end up getting used by their target audience or become another tax shelter for the wealthy.\n\"In Oregon, in some areas, the rent is so high that middle-class families can't save anything for a down payment,\" said Daniel Hauser, a policy analyst with the Oregon Center for Public Policy. \"This [Oregon program] says if you save for a down payment, we'll give you a tax benefit. But you can't get that benefit if you can't save.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T18:00:58.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
