(OTCQB: ZYXI), an innovative medical technology company specializing in the manufacture and sale of non-invasive medical devices for pain management, stroke rehabilitation, cardiac monitoring and neurological diagnostics, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nPresident and CEO Commentary:\nThomas Sandgaard, CEO said: \"I am pleased to report revenue of $6.9 million in the first quarter with net income of $1.9 million or $0.06 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.0 million and the quarterly revenue was twice the revenue of the first quarter of 2017. Revenue was less than the $8.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to insurance company deductibles not being met early in the year, a seasonal trend we see every year in this industry. The investment in growing our sales force has led to device order growth of 36% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and 8% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe currently estimate our second quarter revenue to range between $7.5 million and $8.0 million with Adjusted EBITDA between $2.5 million and $3.0 million. The revenue estimate is approximately 49% to 59% above last year's second quarter and the Adjusted EBITDA estimate is 24% to 48% above last year.\nWe continue to advocate for pain patients not to become part of today's opioid epidemic and for physicians to prescribe our NexWave technology as a first-line-of-defense in treating chronic and acute pain without side effects. I am dedicated to promote our technology in order to minimize addiction and other side effects from prescription opioids.\"\nFirst Quarter Financial Results Summary:\nThe Company reported net revenue of $6.9 million, a 100% increase over Q1-2017. First quarter revenue is historically our lowest of the year as it is affected by health insurance deductibles which have not been met.\nGross margins were 82% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 73% last year. Net income grew 444% to $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.4 million last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 257% to $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.6 million last year.\nThe Company generated $1.0 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 4,288% compared to $23,000 in 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had working capital of $4.6 million compared to $4.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nWebcast Details: Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. MT â€“ 11:00 a.m. ET\nTo register and participate in the webcast, interested parties should click on the following link or dial in approximately 10-15 minutes prior to the webcast:\nhttps://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1487/25740\nUS PARTICIPANT DIAL IN (TOLL FREE):\n1-844-825-9790\nINTERNATIONAL DIAL IN:\n1-412-317-5170\nCanada Toll Free:\n1-855-669-9657\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nZynex reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance. Adjusted EBITDA can be useful for investors or lenders as an indicator of earnings available to service debt. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Zynex\nZynex, founded in 1996, markets and sells its own design of electrotherapy medical devices used for pain management and rehabilitation; and the company's proprietary NeuroMove device designed to help recovery of stroke and spinal cord injury patients.
