The operation ended at 7:15,” deputy chief of national police Syafruddin told reporters.\nFour other police were injured and one inmate killed in the incident which began late on Tuesday.\nThe death toll was the highest suffered by the counter-terrorism police force, known as Detachment, or ‘Densus’, 88, which was set up in 2003 with funding and training from Australia and the United States.\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo thanked security forces for their efforts in containing the crisis.\n“The state and all the people are never afraid and will never give the slightest room to terrorism and also to efforts that undermine the security of the country,” Widodo told a news conference.\nSyafruddin said the crisis was resolved with a “very soft approach”, although earlier on Thursday a Reuters witness had heard several blasts at the jail. Indonesian media reported those blasts were controlled explosions carried out by police to clear the area of any booby traps.\nChief security minister Wiranto told reporters that all 155 convicted terrorists who were involved had surrendered after a police “ambush” forced the last 10 convicts to give up.\nAll the convicts were moved to a maximum-security prison on Nusakambangan Island in central Java.

REUTERS/Darren Whiteside PRISONERS SEIZED WEAPONS\nAuthorities said the prisoners had armed themselves with about 30 weapons, including long-range rifles, taken from officers and a storage area in the jail for weapons confiscated during police operations.\nDeputy police chief Syafruddin said “five officers were killed sadistically”, and a police spokesman said most were found with deep wounds to the neck and elsewhere on their bodies. One officer was found with a gunshot wound to the head.\nFunerals were held on Thursday for the police victims, including one officer who had recently become a father, media said.\nFormer Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Christian who is serving a sentence for blasphemy against Islam at the same prison, was safe and still in the jail, his sister Fifi Lety Indra said.\nThe counter-terrorism squad has won international praise for breaking up militant cells in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.\nBut a recent spate of attacks inspired by Islamic State prompted authorities to more than double its strength to 1,300 late last year.\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for the clashes at the jail, in a message carried on its Amaq news agency.\nPolice had denied Islamic State was involved and said a dispute had broken out over checks by prison authorities of prisoners’ food.\nBut police also said some prisoners had recently met Aman Abdurrahman, who is believed to be the ideological leader of IS sympathisers in Indonesia. He is on trial for terrorism and is being held at the same prison.
