Russia has denied any involvement.\nOfcom said on Monday it was now investigating 11 RT programmes for breaching impartiality rules, with the latest three cases concerning its coverage of U.S. foreign policy, the policies of Ukraine’s government and fracking in Britain.\nThe investigations will examine whether the coverage was sufficiently balanced. Ofcom, which is independent of the government, has previously said there was a high threshold for finding that a broadcaster was not fit to hold a licence.\n“We note the new investigations by Ofcom, and will work with the regulator through its processes,” a spokesman for RT said.
