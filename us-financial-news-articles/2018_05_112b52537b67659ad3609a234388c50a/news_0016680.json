The firm is a supplier and manufacturer of branded and generic pharmaceutical products, as well as infant nutritional and consumer healthcare products.\nAspen, which counts developed Europe as its biggest revenue generator, said in March normalized headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months ended Dec. 31 rose to 872 cents from 692 cents, buoyed by a strong result from therapeutic-focused brands and positive performance of the pharmaceutical business in its home market.\nTherapeutic-focused brands comprising the anaesthetics, thrombosis and high potency and cytotoxic portfolios, delivered revenue of 9.9 billion rand, contributing 45 percent of total group revenue during the period.\n($1 = 12.5716 rand)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T18:46:38.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
