Importantly, a number of these investments were made alongside other Oaktree funds.”\n“Our Board of Directors has approved a proposal to modify our asset coverage requirement from 200% to 150%, and we will also be seeking stockholder approval to accelerate the effective date of this change,” said Mathew Pendo, Chief Operating Officer of Oaktree Strategic Income. “We believe that increasing leverage on OCSI’s primarily first lien portfolio will allow us to further scale our portfolio and ultimately enhance the return on equity for our stockholders.”\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $542.7 million and was comprised of investments in 64 portfolio companies and investments in FSFR Glick JV LLC (\"Glick JV\").\nAt fair value, 89.0% of the Company's portfolio as of March 31, 2018 consisted of senior secured floating-rate debt investments, including 85.5% of first lien loans and 3.5% of second lien loans; 10.7% consisted of a subordinated note investment in Glick JV; and 0.3% consisted of equity investments in other portfolio companies.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Glick JV had $166.6 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 28 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $1.5 million for Oaktree Strategic Income during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of March 31, 2018, including the return on our subordinated note investment in Glick JV, was 7.9%.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company originated $94.3 million of new investment commitments in 11 new portfolio companies and funded $94.7 million of investments across new and existing portfolio companies.\nDuring the quarter, the Company received $75.5 million in connection with the full repayments and exits of 13 of its investments, and an additional $22.9 million in connection with other paydowns and sales of investments.\nResults of Operations\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $10.6 million, including $9.1 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments.\nNet expenses for the quarter were $6.0 million, a slight decline from $6.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower professional fees and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher incentive fees and interest expense.\nNet unrealized appreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $3.1 million. Net realized gain for the quarter was $1.0 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $31.6 million of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), total principal value of debt outstanding of $260.1 million, and $64.9 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facilities and 2015 debt securitization, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 3.7% as of March 31, 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s total leverage ratio was 0.88x debt-to-equity.\nDividend Declaration\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.145 per share, payable on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record on June 15, 2018.\nDividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company’s stockholders.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nAs of March 31, 2018, there were three investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest or original issue discount (\"OID\") income that, in the aggregate, represented 3.8% of the debt portfolio at cost and 1.0% at fair value.\n($ in thousands) Non-Accrual - Debt Investments As of March 31, 2018 As of September 30, 2017 Non-Accrual Investments at Fair Value $ 5,434 $ 6,293 Non-Accrual Investments/Total Investments at Fair Value 1.0 % 1.1 % Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities\nMarch 31, 2018 (unaudited) December 31, 2017 (unaudited) September 30,\n2017 ASSETS Investments at fair value: Control investments (cost March 31, 2018: $72,410,345;
