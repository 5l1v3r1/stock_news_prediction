Alinma Bank was also down 1.1 percent in heavy trade.\nQatar’s index fell 0.6 pct in early trade, dragged down by Qatar National Bank (QNB), which lost 1.7 percent, and telecommunications operator Ooredoo, which was down 1.3 percent.\nThe Dubai index also edged down 0.3 percent as Emaar Properties dropped 1.2 percent.\nConstruction firm Arabtec jumped 5 percent to 1.68 dirhams in early and unusually heavy trade, after reporting a rise in Q1 net profit; and contractor Drake& Scull International gained 1.9 percent in heavy trade.\nAbu Dhabi’s index was also down 0.2 percent as Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA) dived 6.0 percent despite a 43 percent rise in first-quarter profit, boosted by higher crude oil prices.
