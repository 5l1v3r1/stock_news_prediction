Islamic State isn’t known to have a presence in Khost but has expanded its footprint into other areas in recent years.\nLast month, an Islamic State suicide bomber attacked a voter registration center in Kabul, killing 60 people and wounding at least 130 others.\nAfghanistan plans to hold elections in October, the first since 2014.\nThe Taliban and Islamic State have launched a relentless wave of attacks since the start of the year, killing scores of civilians in the capital, Kabul, and elsewhere. Afghan security forces have struggled to combat the groups since the U.S. and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014, switching to a counterterrorism and support role.\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, a vehicle carrying shopkeepers on their way to a market struck a roadside bomb in Afghanistan’s northern Faryab province, killing seven of them. Police spokesman Karim Yuresh said another civilian was wounded in Sunday’s attack, in an area where both the Taliban and Islamic State are active.\nIn the eastern Paktia province, a car bomb killed two people and wounded another three. Abdullah Hsart, the provincial governor’s spokesman, said the attack late Saturday targeted Hazart Mohammad Rodwal, a district chief, who was among the wounded. The Taliban claimed the attack.\n—Copyright 2018 the Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T19:05:52.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
