The Western-backed alliance accuses the Houthis of using the port to smuggle Iranian-made weapons, accusations denied by the group and Tehran.\nThe renewed push toward Hodeidah is taking place amid increased tensions between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, which are locked in a proxy war in Yemen that has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced three million and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation.\nCivilians from Zabid, al-Jarahi, Hays and al-Khoukhah, around 100-150 km (90 miles) south of Hodeidah city, told the rights group that they and many others fled to the southern port city of Aden, where the Yemeni government has a presence.\nThe majority of the displaced said they could only fund the trip by selling their belongings, according to Amnesty.\nOne woman had a miscarriage upon arriving in Aden after what she described as a terrifying and exhausting journey, the group said, adding that the normally six-hour drive now takes three days due to checkpoints, landmines and other hazards.\nReporting By Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T04:36:09.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
