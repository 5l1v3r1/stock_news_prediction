The country must share,” Melenchon said.\nIn Paris, Police said some 30 people were arrested before the start of the march for various offences.\nHolding banners and chanting slogans, protesters are expected to hold rallies in at least 160 places across France, CGT Secretary General Philippe Martinez said, adding that Macron should listen to the growing anger.\nUnions have staged several nationwide strikes since the start of the year, while SNCF rail workers have been carrying out rolling strikes on two of every five days of the week since April over plans to reform the company and open it to competition.\nMacron, 40, who came to power a year-ago promising to push through tough reforms, has shown no sign of surrender so far.\nIn comments last Friday, Macron said the so-called popular wave protest led by Melenchon would not stop him and said the opposition had failed to bring forward any concrete proposals.
