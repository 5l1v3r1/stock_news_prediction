Jury awards have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars.\nLast year, a judge in Los Angeles tossed out a $417 million jury award to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer by using Johnson & Johnson baby powder for feminine hygiene.\nThe judge granted the company's request for a new trial, saying there wasn't convincing evidence that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice and the award for damages was excessive.\n\"Over the past 50 years, multiple independent, non-litigation driven scientific evaluations have been conducted by respected academic institutions and government bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and none have found that the talc in Johnson's Baby Powder contains asbestos,\" the company said Thursday.\nFollow Weber at https://twitter.com/WeberCM", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/WeberCM"], "published": "2018-05-25T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T06:09:12.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
