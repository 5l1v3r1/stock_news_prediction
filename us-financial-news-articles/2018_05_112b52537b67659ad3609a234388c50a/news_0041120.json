It made a return of 11 percent from public equity investments outside of Canada.\n“The protection for us is diversification,” said Machin. “We’ve got to be diversified across geographies, asset classes and strategies.”\n$1 = 1.2778 Canadian dollars Reporting by Matt Scuffham Editing by Bernadette Baum and Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:49:48.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
