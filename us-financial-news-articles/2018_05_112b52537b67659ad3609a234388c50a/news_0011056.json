Qatar denies the charges.\nThe political situation between the pair adds intrigue to Group E, which also features Lebanon and North Korea, but Spanish coach Sanchez believes the 2022 World Cup hosts will be focused on their on-field task.\n“The players are very professional and we’re going to think only about the football,” he said.\n“When we play the game against Saudi for sure there is three points and both teams will need them and we are going to treat them like any other game and thinking only about football.\n“Once you are on the green, it’s only about football.”\nHosts UAE will open the tournament - which runs from January 5 to February 1 next year - when they take on Gulf rivals Bahrain after being drawn in group A with Thailand and India while defending champions Australia, who defeated South Korea in the final in 2015, take on Middle Eastern trio Syria,Palestine and Jordan in group B.
