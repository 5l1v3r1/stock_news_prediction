ISS recommends votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said.\nThat could sway shareholders, corporate governance experts said.\n“It seems that investors do react to these recommendations,” Jill Brown, a management professor at Waltham, Massachusetts-based Bentley University, said in an email.\nBrown pointed to a March non-binding vote by Walt Disney Co shareholders, who rejected a $48.5 million executive compensation plan for Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger by a 52 percent majority.\nBoth proxy advisory firms had advised against Iger’s package.\nGRADED ‘F’ Glass Lewis gave AIG’s package a letter grade of “F.”\n“Overall, the company paid significantly more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,” the report said.\nISS said one-time awards to Duperreault when he joined the company, including a $12 million cash bonus, were not tied to performance.\nAIG declined to comment on the proxy recommendations.\nAIG’s board compensation committee “believes this award properly motivates Mr. Duperreault to create sustainable, profitable growth for AIG, aligning his interests with those of our shareholders,” the proxy filing states.\nSome investors have previously said they would approve of Duperreault’s pay so long as he performs.\nDuperreault has vowed to help the company expand and boost revenue. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.\nAIG is also preparing to finalize its acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd.\nBut his steps have yet to boost the bottom line.\nIn March, AIG said it paid Duperreault $43.1 million last year, according to the proxy filing. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million.\nThat figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc, according to proxy filings by those companies.\nAIG shares have closed as high as $66.06 on Aug. 3, compared with $61.82 on the first trading day following his mid-May appointment.\nThe stock ended down 0.4 percent on Tuesday at $53.08.
