Does your family have a communication and evacuation plan? Stay tuned to your local news and download the FEMA app to get alerts, and make sure you heed any warnings issued by local officials.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT", "external_links": ["https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2017-11-11-moments-hurricane-season-atlantic-irma-maria-harvey", "https://t.co/e5fb8cgwn2", "https://t.co/yXpag4nQ2R", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/hurricane?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/NOAA/status/999674588836585478?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/philklotzbach/status/935571919109160960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/lgzoVaxDK4", "http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/forecasters-predict-near-or-above-normal-2018-atlantic-hurricane-season", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/climate/hurricane-season-2018.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/HurricaneSeason?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TropicalCyclones?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/WMO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/NOAA/status/999673689405886464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/hurricanes?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/AAmb8oL6Vn"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:42:55.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
