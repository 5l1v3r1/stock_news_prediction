These operating revenues were recognized in respect of milestone payments already paid by its partner Servier in connection with ongoing clinical trials of GNbAC1 1 , its lead drug candidate. Given the recent completion of the CHANGE-MS Phase IIb clinical trial in the MS indication, the results of which were published on March 26, 2018, the Company plans to recognize during FY 2018 the last revenues in relation to the milestone payments received in respect of this trial.\nCash used for operating and investing activities amounted to €6.1 million in the first quarter 2018, down from €7.2 million in the first quarter 2017. The Q1 2018 outflow amount included €3.5 million in payments to creditors due at December 31, 2017, plus expenses related to the completion of the CHANGE-MS study. The Company thus expects its cash consumption to decrease significantly from the second half of 2018 onwards.\nGeNeuro’s cash and cash equivalents stood at €20.0 million at March 31, 2018, providing a financial runway till mid-2019.\nKey clinical and regulatory advances during the quarter\nIn late March 2018, GeNeuro published the results of its Phase IIb clinical trial of GNbAC1 at 12 months in multiple sclerosis. For the first time, a therapy has successfully demonstrated a major impact in a large-scale clinical trial (270 patients) on three key neuroprotection markers known to be linked to disease progression, without affecting the patients’ immune system. The results were achieved solely by neutralizing a pathogenic protein produced by patients, called pHERV-W Env, demonstrating its causal role in neurodegeneration. GeNeuro and Servier are evaluating the next steps to this success in the clinical development of GNbAC1. Multiple possibilities are open to them in the various forms of multiple sclerosis, both as a monotherapy for patients with progressive forms of the disease, and in combination with existing drugs for its remitting forms. In February 2018, GNbAC1 received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a rare autoimmune neurological disorder of the peripheral nervous system. It has been observed previously that the pHERV-W Env protein, which is targeted by GNbAC1, was present in approximately half of CIDP patients. This protein impairs the integrity of Schwann cells, which maintain the myelin sheath around peripheral nerves, through the induction of the IL6 and CXCL10 cytokines that locally recruit inflammatory cells and inhibit remyelination. In the United States, the prevalence rate of CIDP is estimated to be 9 cases per 100,000 people. Current long-term therapy is often limited by side effects, and one-third of patients are refractory to existing treatments. During the quarter, GeNeuro also continued its developments in type 1 diabetes and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. In type 1 diabetes, the preliminary results are expected in the third quarter of 2018 for the phase IIa trial for which 60 patients were enrolled on schedule in January 2018. In ALS, the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the US National Institutes of Health remains in force, with preclinical results anticipated during the second half of 2018.\nNext financial report:\nSecond-quarter 2018 revenues and cash position: Thursday July 26, 2018 (after market closes)\nForthcoming investor and industry events:\nEuropean Mid Cap Event\nMay 16, 2018, Copenhagen, Denmark\nOrdinary general meeting of the shareholders\nMay 24, 2018, Geneva, Switzerland\nGilbert Dupont Société de Bourse - Healthcare Forum\nMay 29, 2018, Paris, France\nBIO International Convention 2018\nJune 5-7, 2018, Boston, United States\nKepler Biotech Days\nJune 20, 2018, Paris, France\nAnnual Meeting of the American Diabetes Association\nJune 22-26, 2018, Orlando, United States\nSpring Mid Cap Event\nJune 27-28, 2018, Paris, France\nAbout GeNeuro\nGeNeuro‘s mission is to develop safe and effective treatments against neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and Type 1 Diabetes, by neutralizing causal factors encoded by HERVs, which represent 8% of human DNA.\nGeNeuro is based in Geneva, Switzerland and has R&D facilities in Lyon, France.
