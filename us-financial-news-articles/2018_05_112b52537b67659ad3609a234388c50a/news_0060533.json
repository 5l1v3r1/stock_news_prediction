REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\nTalks have been continuing between the FA, Premier League and Football League regarding the proposal as they look at the possibility of bringing their fixture schedule more in line with the top leagues in Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\nBritish media on Wednesday reported that the break for Premier League teams would be staggered over two weekends, with 10 teams playing one weekend and the other 10 the next weekend, giving each club a two-week rest from the competition.\n\"We've (been) working closer and more collaboratively with the professional game than at any time in recent years. Very soon this will pay dividends with the creation of a mid-season break,\" Glenn said in a statement released on the FA website here\nGlenn added that the winter break, which British media reported would be brought in during the 2019-20 season, was a “much needed improvement” for clubs and the England team.\nSky Sports reported that the details of a winter break are expected to be confirmed in the next two weeks.\nA winter break has long been mooted in the Premier League, not least by overseas coaches who have argued that the existing schedule is too taxing on players.\nThere have been suggestions that the lack of a break leaves Premier League players exhausted for international competitions such as the World Cup which starts in Russia next month.
