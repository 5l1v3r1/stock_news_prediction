The company also disclosed the password flaw in a regulatory filing on Thursday, indicating that the bug was serious enough to warrant more formal disclosure than a corporate blog post. Twitter has about 336 million users, according to its latest letter to shareholders.\nTwitter (twtr) CEO Jack Dorsey followed Agrawal’s post by tweeting that company has “no indication of breach or misuse.” He added that the company warned users because “it’s important for us to be open about this internal defect.”\nThe software bug said to be responsible for the problem appears to be related to how the company secures user passwords through a security technique called hashing, Agrawal explained. Through the hashing technique, Twitter converts passwords into random assortments of numbers so that when users log in, Twitter can validate passwords without actually having to read them.\nBecause of the software bug, however, user passwords were written into an unspecified “internal log” before they could be converted into a series of numbers. As a result, user passwords were left vulnerable, although Twitter said no one appears to have improperly accessed the log. We recently discovered a bug where account passwords were being written to an internal log before completing a masking/hashing process. We’ve fixed, see no indication of breach or misuse, and believe it’s important for us to be open about this internal defect. https://t.co/BJezo7Gk00\n— jack (@jack) May 3, 2018\nAgrawal said that Twitter discovered the error without the help of outside security researchers, removed the passwords from the internal log, and is “implementing plans” to prevent future errors.\nIt’s unclear when Twitter found out about the problem or how long the passwords were left unsecured. Fortune contacted Twitter for more details and will update this story if it responds.\nIronically, Twitter’s password mishap was announced on the corporate holiday known as World Password Day, created by Intel security researchers and celebrated on the first Thursday in May as a way to promote good password and cyber security hygiene .\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nAgrawal initially said via a Tweet that the company “didn’t have to” share the information to the public, but chose to because “it’s the right thing to do.” However, he then backtracked on his statement and said that he “felt strongly that we should.”“My mistake,” Agrawal added.\nDorsey then commended him for “admitting our mistakes quickly, learning, and moving on.” Openly admitting our mistakes quickly, learning, and moving on. I love my teammates. https://t.co/pn9sgUf1Op ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T01:32:21.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
