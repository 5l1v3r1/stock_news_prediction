The commerce ministry later that month said Qualcomm needs to do more to complete the takeover because the U.S. company’s initial set of remedies to resolve competition issues were insufficient.\nApproval of the deal is not definite and still could be delayed, Bloomberg said, citing the sources.\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
