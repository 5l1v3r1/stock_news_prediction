If I’m consistently performing then I want to play these two World Cups.”\nA middle order batsman and also bowls off-spin, Malik played 35 tests for Pakistan and has represented the team in 261 one-day internationals and 95 Twenty20 matches.\nHe played for the Barbados Tridents in the CPL for the last five years but has now joined the Guyana Amazon Warriors for the 2018 edition, which will run from Aug. 8-Sept. 16.\n“Guyana is more like you’re playing in the sub-continent I think,” said Malik, who has also played in the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League.\n“But on that particular day performance is the key of any cricketer and that’s what I’m looking for.\n“Obviously, if you’re playing for a new team the expectations are a lot from you. When they have seen someone that did well for a longer run the expectations are obviously high.” (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T09:45:41.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
