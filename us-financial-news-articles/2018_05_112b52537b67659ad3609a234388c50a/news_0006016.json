But the region’s complex geopolitics and security concerns have hindered its construction.\nTAPI will transport 33 billion cubic meters of gas a year along an 1,800 km (1,125 mile) route from Turkmenistan’s Galkynysh, the world’s second-biggest gas field, to Fazilka in northwest India.\n“We have announced our readiness to Turkmenistan for exporting their natural gas to Pakistan, but have not received any response from them,” Araqi said.\n“Given Iran’s situation in the centre of the region, we can join every gas pipeline that passes around the country.” (Writing by Parisa Hafezi, editing by Louise Heavens and Alexander Smith)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:27:39.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
