His comments on Tuesday came after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said over the weekend that the two countries had put the prospect of a trade war \"on hold\" while they work on a wider trade agreement, which helped revive appetite for riskier assets. COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.5 percent at $6,945 a tonne by 0143 GMT, after peaking at $6,999 on Tuesday, its loftiest since April 26. In Shanghai, the most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose to a nearly one-month high of 52,180 yuan ($8,187) a tonne, tracking overnight gains in London. GRASBERG: Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd said it was in discussions to sell its interest in the world's second largest copper mine to Indonesia's Inalum for $3.5 billion. MARKETS: The dollar slipped after six straight days of gains as U.S. Treasury yields dipped and investors looked to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's May 1-2 meeting to be released later on Wednesday. Asian shares ticked higher but investors were on edge as Trump tempered optimism over progress made so far in trade talks between the world's two largest economies. LEAD: LME lead retreated from a 12-week high, down 0.9 percent to $2,452.50 a tonne, after what analysts said was a rally driven by Chinese speculators on Tuesday as they bet on potential supply shortages. In Shanghai, lead slipped 0.6 percent to 20,095 yuan per tonne, after hitting 20,465 yuan on Tuesday, its strongest since October 2017. NORTH KOREA TALKS: Trump also said there was a \"substantial chance\" his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons. FED SURVEY: U.S. households are feeling more stable, small businesses are making money and many expect to expand and hire in the coming year, signs of continued optimism in two key parts of the economy, the Federal Reserve reported in a pair of annual surveys.
