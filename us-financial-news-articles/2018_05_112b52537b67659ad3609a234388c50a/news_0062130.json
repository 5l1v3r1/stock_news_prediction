No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur,” the club website statement said.\n“The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision,” it added. “The decision was made due to the current unfavourable investment climate.” A statue of Peter Osgood can be seen outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge football stadium in London, Britain, May 31, 2018.

The current stadium capacity is around 42,000.\nLast year, London mayor Sadiq Khan approved the 500 million pound redevelopment, although the estimated cost of the project has risen since.
