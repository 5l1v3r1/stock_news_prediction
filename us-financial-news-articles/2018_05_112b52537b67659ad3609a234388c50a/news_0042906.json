Reports suggested the 5-Star and League parties, trying to form a government after inconclusive March 4 elections, had written a draft coalition deal asking for debt forgiveness from the European Central Bank, frightening investors in the euro zone’s third-largest economy.\nItalian stocks fell half a percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.16 percent.\nEuro zone banks slid 0.51 percent, although they pulled back from earlier larger losses after a League spokesman said the request for cancellation of the debt was never in the official draft of the government programme.\n“The proposal is surreal. Pretending the unilateral cancellation of 250 billion euros of debt bought by the ECB as part of the QE programme... would be absurd,” said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manger at Milan-based Anthilia Capital Partners.\n“Even if unfeasible, the tone of the debate bolsters expectations there will be a stormy relationship with Europe and a further relaxation of financial discipline.”\nThe difference in Italian government borrowing costs over German rose sharply overnight but later pulled back.\nThe euro traded up slightly at $1.1846, away from 2018 lows hit on Tuesday, with the single currency seemingly shrugging off concerns about Italian politics.\nThe MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, traded flat.\nNorth Korea’s cancellation of a June 12 summit in Singapore added to a backdrop of geopolitical worries for financial markets, given it could see tensions on the Korean peninsula flare again and damage U.S.-China efforts to resolve an ongoing trade dispute.\n“This will weigh on the Korean reconstruction beneficiaries that have had a strong run on peace and even reunification hopes recently,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note.\n“The broader risk for the region if talks do break down is that Trump no longer feels the need to keep China on side and could escalate trade tensions again.”\nIn currency markets, the dollar paused below five-month highs reached on Tuesday after economic data out of the United States pushed bond yields and demand for the greenback higher.\nThe U.S. currency has enjoyed a blistering rally in recent weeks as investors focus on a Federal Reserve raising interest rates while central banks elsewhere push back policy tightening.\nStrong U.S. retail sales and factory data on Tuesday pushed the U.S. 10-year yield through a key level to hit 3.095 percent, its highest since July 2011, raising worries about higher borrowing costs for companies worldwide.\nThe 10-year yield was last at 3.065 percent.\nRising U.S. borrowing costs and a stronger dollar are having their biggest impact in emerging markets, where investors are pulling money out, particularly from countries with large deficits and dollar funding needs.\nThe Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low while the Malaysian ringgit hit a four-month low overnight.\nThe Turkish lira weakened and approached a fresh record low . President Tayyip Erdogan’s comments that he plans to take greater control of the economy have hammered the lira this week.\nIn commodities markets, gold rebounded after hitting a 4 1/2-month low the previous day on a strong dollar.\nCrude oil prices remained near recent highs amid concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran may restrict crude exports from a major producer.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar\nadditional reporting by Andrew Galbraith in SHANGHAI, Tomo Uetake in TOKYO and Swati Pandey in SYDNEY; Editing by Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-05-16T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T16:39:38.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
