DynCorp could be valued at around eight times its 2018 earnings after taxes of $168 million, the sources said.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. A spokesperson for Cerberus declined to comment.\nLast year, Cerberus said if its chief were to join the U.S. administration clearing hurdles associated with conflicts of interest would require Feinberg to provide “voluminous information” and disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics.\nIn 2010, Cerberus took DynCorp private for more than $1 billion. The company has had contracts to train Iraqi police and support U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\nThe timing of the sale may be opportune for Cerberus, after the Pentagon’s budget was increased to nearly $700 billion last year. Rising U.S. government spending for the Pentagon has fueled a spree of dealmaking among defense services companies.\nMoody’s Investors Service Inc recently upgraded DynCorp’s rating on its debt. Moody’s analyst Bruce Herskovics said, “The upgrade reflects backlog growth coupled with improved profitability under existing contracts that should continue over 2018-2019.”\nIn April, weapons maker General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) bought CSRA Inc CSRA.N for $9.7 billion to expand its government services business.\nThis month, defense electronics company L3 Technologies Inc ( LLL.N ) sold Vertex, its aerospace and defense logistics support services unit, for $540 million.\nRemington Outdoor Co Inc, which was once a Cerberus investment, and makes the Bushmaster rifle emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week.\nTrade publication Debtwire reported news of DynCorp exploring a sale earlier on Wednesday.\nReporting by Mike Stone in Washington; editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:11:59.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
