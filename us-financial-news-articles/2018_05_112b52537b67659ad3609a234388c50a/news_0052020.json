Accelerated change is the only option,\" said M&S.\nShares in M&S have fallen 26 percent over the last year and the firm is in danger of being booted out of the prestigious FTSE 100 index.\nThe stock closed Tuesday at 292 pence, valuing the business at 4.7 billion pounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:35:29.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
