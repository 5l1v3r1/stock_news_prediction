(“Rosehill” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ROSE) (NASDAQ:ROSEW) (NASDAQ:ROSEU) today reported operational and financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and recent key items.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights and Recent Key Items:\nGrew average net first quarter production to 12,256 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”) (77% oil and 89% total liquids), an increase of 67% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 Increased production average for the month of April to a record high of over 18,000 net BOEPD Reported a net loss attributable to Rosehill of $1.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, 2018, which included an $18.2 million non-cash, pre-tax loss on commodity derivative instruments Delivered Adjusted EBITDAX of $34.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 86% quarter over quarter Successfully syndicated Rosehill's revolving credit facility in March, increasing the borrowing base 100% to $150 million with a $500 million total capacity Spud nine operated horizontal wells and completed nine wells in the first quarter of 2018, with five total drilled and uncompleted (“DUC”) wells at March 31, 2018 Spud the first two wells in the Southern Delaware basin in April and May, with first production results expected later this summer Drilling two salt water disposal (“SWD”) wells in Loving County in May that are expected to reduce current costs by $1 to $2 million per well, per month Executed 10,000 barrels per day of Midland-Cushing basis swaps for June 2018 through June 2019 to protect from widening basis differentials\nJ.A. (Alan) Townsend, Rosehill’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “I am very pleased with our first quarter results and excited about the tremendous production and Adjusted EBITDAX growth we are experiencing. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we were able to grow average net production 67% quarter over quarter and in April produced over 18,000 BOEPD. Coupled with strong commodity prices, we were able to substantially increase Adjusted EBITDAX in the quarter to $34.9 million. We have a rig drilling on our Southern Delaware acreage, with coring and scientific analysis currently underway to determine the optimal development of our White Wolf acreage. We also expect to spud our first horizontal well in Lea County, New Mexico later this month. We are well positioned to drive shareholder value and make 2018 a tremendous year for Rosehill.”\nOperational Results\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s net daily production averaged 12,256 net BOEPD, a 67% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 average, comprised of 9,433 barrels of oil per day, 1,433 barrels of natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) per day and 8.4 million cubic feet of gas (“MMCF”) per day. Rosehill operated two rigs, drilled nine gross horizontal wells, completed nine wells in the first quarter and had five drilled uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) at the end of the first quarter. The Company continues to experience strong improvement in drilling efficiency that has reduced spud to total depth in Loving County from over 30 days at year end 2016 to under 15 days across all zones.\nRosehill continues to demonstrate and expect strong production growth in 2018 and beyond. In April, strong new well results enabled total Company production to average over 18,000 net BOEPD, another record high for Rosehill.\nIn late February, the Company began flowback on a three well pad on the Z&T 32 lease in Loving County, with all three wells producing from the lower Wolfcamp A formation. These wells have performed above the Company’s type curve expectations for their formation, with combined initial production (“IP”) 30-day rates of over 6,400 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day or 304 barrels of oil per thousand lateral feet.\nFinancial Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported a net loss attributable to Rosehill of $1.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 included an $18.2 million non-cash, pre-tax loss on commodity derivative instruments. The fourth quarter 2017 included an $18.1 million non-cash, pre-tax loss on commodity derivative instruments and a $5.0 million pre-tax gain on sale of assets.\nAdjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure defined and reconciled below) totaled $34.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase of 86% was driven by higher production, higher percentage of total production being comprised of oil and increased commodity pricing.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, average realized prices (all prices excluding the effects of derivatives) were $60.72 per barrel of oil, $2.32 per Mcf of natural gas and $19.28 per barrel of NGLs, resulting in a total equivalent price of $50.58 per BOE, up 19% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRosehill’s cash operating costs for the first quarter of 2018 were $16.21 per BOE, which includes lease operating expenses (“LOE”), gathering and transportation, production taxes and general and administrative expenses (“G&A”) and excludes costs associated with stock-based compensations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Rosehill incurred capital costs, excluding asset retirement costs and leasing and acquisition costs, of $96 million.\nCapital Structure and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Rosehill had $7 million in cash on hand, $173 million in long-term debt, $82 million in Series A convertible preferred stock and $144 million in Series B redeemable preferred stock. As of March 31, 2018, total liquidity was approximately $127 million which included cash on hand, approximately $70 million of availability under the revolving credit facility (see update below) and the Company’s ability to issue an additional $50 million shares of Series B preferred stock.\nCredit Facility Update\nIn March 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2023, with an initial borrowing base of $150 million. The borrowing base will be redetermined semi-annually, with lenders and Rosehill each having the right to one interim redetermination between any two consecutive scheduled redeterminations. The first scheduled redetermination date is August 1, 2018. The facility was provided by a syndicate of five financial institutions led by JPMorgan Chase.\nDevelopment Update\nThe Company spud its first Southern Delaware well on April 11, 2018, with early well results expected this summer. The Company plans to obtain cores and perform extensive data gathering on its first four wells to best determine the optimal development of the new White Wolf acreage. Initial drilling at White Wolf will provide a technical framework for full-scale development and will also help anchor the new 3D seismic survey currently being acquired. The four initial wells will core the Bone Spring, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B, which has proven to be a very prolific reservoir in the White Wolf area. The Company currently expects to keep one rig operating in the White Wolf area for the remainder of the year. Rosehill expects to drill 16 to 22 new wells in the White Wolf area in 2018 and complete 12 to 16 of those wells. While the majority of these wells will have lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 feet, the Company is projecting four to eight extended lateral wells greater than 7,000 feet in 2018.\nAdditionally, the Company plans to keep one rig operating in the Northern Delaware for the remainder of the year focusing on Loving County development, including the drilling of its Tatanka well in Lea County, New Mexico targeting the Lower Wolfcamp A and the drilling of two salt water disposal wells in Loving County in the second quarter. The two new SWD wells will have up to 60,000 barrels per day of combined capacity and are included in the Company’s previously announced 2018 capital plan. At full capacity, these wells could potentially result in up to $4 million in cost savings per month.\nThe Company has been planning and building out its White Wolf infrastructure as well as negotiating and securing marketing contracts for future production in the area. Rosehill has secured a gas marketing contract for its production and is analyzing various oil marketing options.\nCommodity Hedging\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had the following outstanding derivative contracts:\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Commodity derivative swaps Oil: Notional volume (Bbls) 2,044,000 2,664,000 960,000 360,000 300,000 Weighted average fixed price ($/Bbl) $ 55.04 $ 53.59 $ 51.16 $ 50.42 $ 50.12 Natural Gas: Notional volume (MMBtu) 2,880,000 2,220,000 1,500,000 1,200,000 1,200,000 Weighted average fixed price ($/MMbtu) $ 3.02 $ 2.88 $ 2.84 $ 2.85 $ 2.87 Commodity derivative two-way collars Oil: Notional volume (Bbls) 210,000 420,000 — — — Weighted average ceiling price ($/Bbl) $ 58.25 $ 60.03 $ — $ — $ — Weighted average floor price ($/Bbl) $ 55.00 $ 53.14 $ — $ — $ — Commodity derivative three-way collars Oil: Notional volume (Bbls) — 240,000 — — — Weighted average ceiling price ($/Bbl) $ — $ 61.75 $ — $ — $ — Weighted average floor price ($/Bbl) $ — $ 52.50 $ — $ — $ — Weighted average sold put option price ($/Bbl) $ — $ 42.50 $ — $ — $ — After March 31, 2018 and through May 8, 2018, the Company entered into the following commodity derivative instruments:\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Commodity derivative swaps Oil: Notional volume (Bbls) 120,000 — — — — Weighted average fixed price ($/Bbl) $ 63.05 $ — $ — $ — $ — Commodity derivative two-way collars Oil: Notional volume (Bbls) 153,000 181,000 — — — Weighted average ceiling price ($/Bbl) $ 64.25 $ 64.25 $ — $ — $ — Weighted average floor price ($/Bbl) $ 60.00 $ 60.00 $ — $ — $ — Commodity derivative three-way collars Oil: Notional volume (Bbls) — 368,000 1,098,000 — — Weighted average ceiling price ($/Bbl) $ — $ 69.20 $ 66.22 $ — $ — Weighted average floor price ($/Bbl) $ — $ 55.00 $ 54.17 $ — $ — Weighted average sold put option price ($/Bbl) $ — $ 45.00 $ 44.17 $ — $ — Crude oil basis swaps Midland / Cushing: Notional volume (Bbls) 2,140,000 3,160,000 2,415,600 — — Weighted average fixed price ($/Bbl) $ (4.95 ) $ (4.09 ) $ (1.59 ) $ — $ — Conference Call, Webcast and Presentation\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter financial and operating results on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization, accretion and impairment of oil and natural gas properties, (gains) losses on commodity derivatives excluding net cash receipts (payments) on settled commodity derivatives, gains and losses from the sale of assets, exploration costs, transaction costs incurred in connection with the Transaction and other non-cash operating items. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows for more effective evaluation and comparison of Rosehill’s operating performance and results of operations from period to period without regard to the Company’s financing methods or capital structure. Rosehill excludes the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. Rosehill’s computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nThree months ended March 31, December 31, March 31, (In thousands)\n2018 2017 2017 Net income (loss) $ (7,756 ) $ (10,746 ) $ 4,414 Interest expense, net 3,867 1,258 543 Income tax expense (benefit) (2,190 ) 2,340 86 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 20,809 9,941 8,231 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties — 1,061 — (Gain) loss on unsettled commodity derivatives, net 18,242 18,142 (2,193 ) Transaction costs — — 1,094 Stock based compensation 1,462 1,245 — Exploration costs 436 539 317 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 133 (4,984 ) (11 ) Other (income) / expenses, net (100 ) 10 115 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 34,903 $ 18,806 $ 12,596 Forward-Looking Statements\nThis communication includes certain statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws.
