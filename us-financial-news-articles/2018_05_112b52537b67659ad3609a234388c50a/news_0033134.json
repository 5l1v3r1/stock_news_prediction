Energy and healthcare saw the largest gains.\nU.S. optical component maker stocks received a boost from the ZTE news, with Acacia Communications up 9.1 percent and Oclaro Inc and Lumentum Holdings Inc advancing 4.5 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.\nShares of defense contractors such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp weighed on the markets, as investors pointed to easing geopolitical tensions.\nXerox Corp shares tumbled 5.4 percent after abandoning a planned $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp.\nShares of Viacom Inc were down 7.0 percent after CBS Corp sued to stop controlling shareholder Shari Redstone from continuing with her plan to merge it with Viacom. CBS rose 3.2 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
