(TSX:XDC) ( “Xtreme” or the “Company” ) announces its first quarter 2018 financial and operating results. It is anticipated that filing will take place on SEDAR of Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, by May 4, 2018. All reported amounts are in Canadian dollars (\"CAD\"), unless otherwise noted.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nOperating days for the quarter were 844, an increase from 707 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in operating days from the prior quarter was based on the reactivation of two rigs during the quarter, the operating days contributed by the first 850XE rig that commenced operations in January 2018 and the second 850XE rig which commenced operations in late March 2018 on an 18-month contract in the Utica play of the Appalachian Basin. Utilization was 85 percent for the quarter, compared to 77 percent in the fourth quarter.\nThe third 850XE rig was in the process of mobilization to the Appalachian Basin for the same customer at the end of the quarter. It also is contracted for 18-months and commenced operations in mid-April.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported revenue of $21.3 million as compared to $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase is due to higher utilization and higher day-rates earned during the period. Revenue per day increased to $25,262 in the first quarter of 2018 from $23,088 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses include all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of the drilling operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, operating expenses were $20,699 per operating day, an increase from $18,919 per operating day in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating expenses per operating day increased in the first quarter primarily due to the impact of start-up and mobilization of the first two 850XE rigs as well as the reactivation costs for the two idle XDR 500 rigs.\nGeneral and Administrative expenses were $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the previous quarter is due primarily to higher professional fees.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.5 million for the first quarter, an increase from what was reported in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.8 million.\nIn March 2018, the Company executed an amendment to the loan agreement with an equipment finance lender to increase the amount of an existing loan by $3.0 million US dollar (\"USD\") to $9.0 million USD in total. The $9.0 million USD loan has a term of 42 months, with a balloon payment of approximately $1.6 million USD due at the end of the term. There are no restrictive covenants associated with this debt and is secured by the single asset of Rig 801.\nThe Company’s US dollar revenue and expenses are impacted by the exchange rate between the US dollar and Canadian dollar. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the average exchange rate used to convert the USD-denominated revenues and expenses to CAD was $1.29/$1 USD ($1.27 for the previous quarter).\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter were $16.1 million, which included approximately $14.1 million related to the 850XE rig build program. In the second quarter the Company anticipates final capital expenses of approximately $2.0 million related to the 850XE build and related spares.\nOutlook\nXtreme finalized the rig build portion of the 850XE program in the first quarter of 2018. Two of the three rigs commenced operations during the quarter with the third rig spudding its first well in mid-April. The completion of the 850XE design and build is a significant milestone for the Company. The combination of drilling depth capacity and technological innovation make the 850XE the ideal rig design for the most challenging of US pad drilling operations. The Company envisions opportunities in the future to create additional scale around the 850XE platform.\nInitial performance has been encouraging for the 850XE rigs. Aside from normal start-up items and final commissioning the drilling penetration rate and non-drilling efficiencies have been as expected. Once the Company has completed several wells we are confident that the 850XE will fully live up to the goal of being the most optimized pad drilling rig in US land.\nThe nine marketed XDR 500 fleet continued to perform well in the first quarter of 2018. Utilization increased as two rigs returned to work in January. Currently, the Company has two XDR 500 rigs idle but anticipates one returning to work in the coming weeks. Overall, the XDR 500 rigs are efficient AC electric rigs with a history of impressive performance across multiple US basins. Today they operate primarily in the DJ, Williston and Anadarko Basins of Colorado, North Dakota and Oklahoma respectively.\nThe supportive WTI oil prices and demand for efficient rigs provides a relatively strong macro environment. Overall, the Company has an optimistic outlook for the US drilling business over the coming 12 months. The Company has a significant revenue backlog and will look for opportunities to improve pricing as rigs roll off contract.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Information from Continuing Operations\nThree months ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Sep 30, 2017 Jun 30, 2017 Revenue 21,321 16,323 18,172 15,141 Adjusted EBITDA 1,468 818 1,008 (1,630 ) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 7 % 5 % 6 % (11 )% Net loss (5,926 ) (9,564 ) (8,673 ) (48,366 ) Net loss per share - basic ($) (0.08 ) (0.13 ) (0.12 ) (0.61 ) Operating cash flows from continuing operations 834 (3,130 ) (3,096 ) (4,957 ) Capital assets 220,572 205,456 203,316 196,704 Total assets 262,927 251,573 253,171 272,798 Net debt 2,772 (8,126 ) (19,144 ) (41,682 ) Operating days 844 707 851 683 Utilization (percentage) 85 % 77 % 93 % 75 % Weighted average number of rigs in service 11 10 10 10 Total number of available rigs, end of quarter 12 10 10 10 Mar 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 Sep 30, 2016 Jun 30, 2016 Revenue 12,379 9,929 8,468 7,369 Adjusted EBITDA (78 ) (148 ) (1,423 ) (5,449 ) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue (1 )% (1 )% (17 )% (74 )% Net loss (12,168 ) (11,122 ) (29,542 ) (28,699 ) Net loss per share - basic ($) (0.14 ) (0.13 ) (0.35 ) (0.34 ) Operating cash flows from continuing operations 101 (1,032 ) (1,168 ) (10,849 ) Capital assets 245,267 240,656 243,564 266,188 Total assets 348,083 366,762 373,104 409,794 Net debt (88,152 ) (113,882 ) (118,863 ) (110,794 ) Operating days 583 479 433 355 Utilization (percentage) 36 % 25 % 22 % 19 % Weighted average number of rigs in service 18 21 21 21 Total number of rigs, end of quarter 18 21 21 21 Conference Call Details\nXtreme has scheduled a conference call to discuss results with investors, analysts, and stakeholders on Friday, May 4, 2018, beginning promptly at 10:00 am MT (11:00 am CT, 12:00 am ET).\nMatt Porter, President and Chief Executive Officer, will host the conference call.\nConference operator dial in numbers\nTo participate in the conference call, please dial in as follows approximately ten minutes before the start time in your time zone.\n+1 844-889-6858 (North America Toll-Free) or +1 661-378-9711 (International)\nWebcast: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/byfigto8 Conference ID: 6998699\nAn audio replay of the call will be available until 4:00, May 9, 2018.
