The delegation will work across the country, and also monitor complaints that may be filed after the election.\n\"EU election observers maintain strict impartiality, objectivity and independence,\" said a statement announcing the news.\nHolding free and fair elections has been front and centre of Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa's agenda since he took power in November. Former President Robert Mugabe was ousted in a coup, ending his rule of nearly four decades.\nThe news \"is a further sign of Mnangagwa's efforts to normalise political and ultimately business relations with the West,\" Charles Laurie, director and head of politics at analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC Tuesday.\n\"Zimbabwean manufacturers, traders and tourism operators will rejoice if the EU's presence at the polls proves to be the first step towards extending a political olive branch,\" he said. \"An endorsement of the election's legitimacy from Brussels is a critical next step for major Western investors to set aside their doubts over whether the country is 'open for business.'\"\nJekesai Njikizana | AFP | Getty Images Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa delivers a speech during Independence Day celebrations at the National Sports Stadium on April 18, 2018, in the capital Harare. Mnangagwa has courted the international investment community in an attempt to turn around Zimbabwe's basket case economy, infamous for its corruption and hyperinflation.\nEarlier in May Zimbabwe applied to re-join the Commonwealth, a 53-nation bloc comprising of the U.K. and its former colonies. Membership of the group could bring trade benefits to Zimbabwe. Mugabe pulled the country out of the bloc in 2003 in a row over sanctions.\nBut, Mnangagwa's first state visit outside of Africa was to China in April of this year. In Laurie's view, Mnangagwa understands the limitations of Zimbabwe's historically close relationship with the world's second largest economy. \"He recognises that (Zimbabwe's) so-called 'Look East' policy has failed to remedy a dismal, politically-skewed and perilous environment in which local business all but ground to a halt.\"\nResource-rich Zimbabwe has the world's second biggest platinum reserves after neighboring South Africa, as well as gold, diamonds, coal and lithium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:19:16.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
