The delegations are respectively led by Joe Hagin, a White House deputy chief of staff, and Kim Chang Son, a close aide to the North Korean dictator, the person said.\nThe flurry of diplomatic activity signaled an effort by both sides to salvage the talks, which only days ago appeared to have collapsed. Trump had said on Thursday that he would withdraw from the summit with Kim, citing “open hostility” from North Korea. But a hastily arranged meeting of the North and South Korean leaders over the weekend, and a conciliatory statement from Trump, appeared to put the meeting back on course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T13:30:11.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
