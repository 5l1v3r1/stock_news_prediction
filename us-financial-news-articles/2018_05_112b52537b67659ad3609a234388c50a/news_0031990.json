This represents an increase of 22% from the previous year’s dividend of $4.5 per share.\nAPPENDIX 1: IMPACT OF ADOPTING IFRS ON THE Q1 17 INCOME STATEMENT\nInformation on Options Retained in First-Time Adoption\nThe move from the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) accounting standard to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) was conducted in accordance with IFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. As an affiliate that became a first-time adopter later than its parent, the Company chose to measure its assets and liabilities as the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of Total S.A.\nSummary of the Main Impacts on the Q1 17 Income Statement\nNet income (OHADA) 11 Unit-of-production method - IAS 16 note 1 (3) Exceptional depreciation - IAS 16 note 1 (3) Site restoration - IAS 16 note 2 (1) Measurement of oil and gas inventories - IAS 2 note 3 (1) Deferred taxes - IAS 12 note 4 2 Total adjustments (6) Net income (IFRS) 5 Notes\nIn terms of measurement, Q1 17 net income was primarily impacted by the application of IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment, as well as by the recognition of deferred taxes.\nNote 1 – Property, Plant and Equipment\nDevelopment costs for the drilling of development wells and for the construction of production facilities are capitalized, together with borrowing costs incurred during the period of construction and present value of estimated and future costs of asset retirement obligations. The depletion rate is equal to the ratio between oil and gas production for the period and proved developed reserves (unit-of-production method). Previously, the Company determined depreciation using the straight-line method.\nNote 2 – Asset Retirement (Site Restoration)\nUnder IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment, an item of property, plant and equipment should initially be recorded at cost. Cost includes the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located if such an obligation exists when the asset is recognized. A corresponding asset retirement obligation is recorded in liabilities.\nChanges in the liability for an asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time are measured by applying a risk-free discount rate to the amount of the liability.\nNote 3 – Oil and gas inventories\nOver- or underliftings of hydrocarbons are valued based on the entitlement method, under which production is valued at the selling price at the date of the preparation on of the financial statements. Previously, any such difference between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on net working interest, was valued at production cost.\nNote 4 – Deferred Taxes\nUnder the deferred tax method, both current tax expense (or income) and deferred tax expense (or income) relating to the current or previous periods are disclosed in the financial statements.\nCurrent taxes, calculated according to tax regulations, are recognized in the statement of income and the balance sheet. Deferred income taxes are recognized on a separate line. In accordance with IAS 12 – Income Taxes and the “comprehensive balance sheet method,” deferred income taxes are recorded based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recorded in the balance sheet and their tax bases. Permanent differences do not give rise to deferred taxes.\n1 Including profit oil reverting to the Gabonese Republic as per production sharing contracts.\nTotal Gabon\nSociété anonyme incorporated in Gabon with a Board of Directors and share capital of $76,500,000\nHeadquarters: Boulevard Hourcq, Port-Gentil, BP 525, Gabonese Republic\nwww.total.ga\nRegistered in Port-Gentil: 2000 B 00011\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005890/en/\nTotal Gabon\nFlorent Caillet\nflorent.caillet@total.com\nSource: Total Gabon", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005890/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.total.ga&esheet=51805805&newsitemid=20180514005890&lan=en-US&anchor=www.total.ga&index=1&md5=f75956cf6719e10d6a7cd3778d37de1b"], "published": "2018-05-14T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T19:41:42.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
