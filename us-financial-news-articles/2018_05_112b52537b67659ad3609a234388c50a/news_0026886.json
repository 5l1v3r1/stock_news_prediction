They are due to appear in court when police complete their investigation, which may take weeks.\nItalian media have said Cheema was in love with someone in Brescia whom she planned to marry, but her family did not approve.\n“Sana was in love with someone in Italy,” Sulehria quoted the father as saying.\nThe family had suggested several alternative suitors, but Cheema declined, Sulehria told Reuters.\nReuters could not reach the family or a representative to seek comment. A telephone number for a relative appeared to have been turned off. The Italian embassy in Islamabad has not made any comment on the case.\nIn 2016, a British woman of Pakistani origin was killed by her father and her ex-husband in the eastern city of Jhelum after she married someone she loved in England.\nPakistan adopted legislation against “honor killings” in 2016, introducing tough punishment and closing a legal loophole that had allowed killers to walk free if pardoned by family members.\nPolice in Pakistan’s most populous province of Punjab, where honor crimes have been rampant, said recently the numbers of such killings had fallen since the law was introduced.
