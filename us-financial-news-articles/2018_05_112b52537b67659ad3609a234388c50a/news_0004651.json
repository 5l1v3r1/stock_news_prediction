Net profit of $34 million also beat forecasts.\nAnalysts were positive about the results, highlighting the broad-based sales development and the strong increase in operating cash flow. “These were a very good set of results from Logitech, which shows it is keeping up its growth momentum. The operating cash flow nearly doubled during the quarter, and the growth was broad-based across several categories,” said Andreas Mueller, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank.\n“Although the results were supported by the weaker dollar, that doesn’t tell the whole story. The company has a tight grip on costs and three product lines that are doing very well.”\nLogitech, the world’s biggest maker of computer mice, could also increase it profitability target in future, Darrell said.\nThe company, which aims for gross profit in the 35 to 37 percent bracket, reported a gross margin of 36.4 percent during its fourth quarter.\n“There is a possibility of raising that,” Darrell said in the interview. “There is potential to do better than we are doing for sure,” he added.\nFor the moment, though, Logitech was prioritising sales growth rather than upping its margin target corridor, he said.
