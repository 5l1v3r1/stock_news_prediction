REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\nThe new plan comes just days after the European Commission said it would take Britain and five other European Union member states to the EU Court of Justice for failing to respect air quality limits.\nUnder the EU’s Air Quality Directive, member states were supposed to comply with nitrogen dioxide emission limits in 2010 - or by 2015 if they delivered plans to deal with high levels of the gas, which is produced mainly by diesel engines.\nThe Commission said Britain had failed to respect curbs on nitrogen dioxide which is associated with respiratory and other illnesses.\nThe government said its plan was on top of a 3.5 billion pound plan to reduce air pollution from road transport and diesel vehicles set out in July last year.\nIt would aim to halve the number of people living in locations where concentrations of particulate matter are above World Health Organisation limits, the government said.\nIn addition, legislation will be introduced to give local authorities powers to improve air quality and ensure only the cleanest domestic fuels were available for sale.\nThe government will also take action to tackle ammonia from farming by requiring farmers to invest in infrastructure and equipment that will reduce emissions.\nIt said it would reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated 1 billion pounds a year by 2020, rising to 2.5 billion pounds a year from 2030.\nThe new strategy drew criticism from some lawmakers and environmental groups.\nCaroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, said the details of the plan looked “extremely underwhelming” and failed to be backed up with cash.
