Hopefully I make the final XI. It’ll be an incredible feeling,” he told BBC.\n“I played my first game a long time ago, 20 years ago, so to get to this point, where we’re on the verge of our first Test, is a great feeling, I can’t wait.”\nPakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed backed Ireland to take their experience from limited-overs matches and thrive in the test format.\n“It is a privilege to be a part of this historic Test match and all of us are really looking forward to it,” the 30-year-old said.\n“Ireland players feature prominently in the ICC ODI (one-day internationals) and T20I (Twenty20 internationals) player rankings, and I am confident that in due course they will also make their mark in the Test rankings.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T19:30:00.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
