She has a well-established track record of leading companies through significant growth, enhanced operating efficiency and increased profitability on a large scale.\"\nRose continues: \"Furthermore, Carol's leadership positions have afforded her valuable expertise in addressing issues facing boards today, including global human-capital talent deployment strategy, succession planning, mergers and acquisitions, digital disruption, and physical security and related cybersecurity. We look forward to benefiting from her experience and strategic leadership.\"\nFor more than 25 years, Johnson has held increasingly large and complex line profit-loss roles, most recently as President and COO of AlliedBarton Security Services, LLC, where she was responsible for the growth and profit of a $2-billion private corporation.
