The user said the photo of the T-shirt was taken at an outlet store in Canada.\n\"Gap Inc. respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. We've learned that a Gap brand T-shirt sold in some overseas markets failed to reflect the correct map of China. We sincerely apologize for this unintentional error,\" it said in a statement posted on its Weibo account on Monday evening.\nIt added that the products had been pulled from the Chinese market and destroyed.\nGap's apology comes as China has been ramping up efforts to police language used to describe Chinese-claimed territories such as Taiwan. Other U.S. companies which have issued apologies for similar incidents include Delta Air Lines and Marriott International .\nEarlier this month, the White House sharply criticized China's efforts to force foreign airlines to change how they described Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau on their websites as \"Orwellian nonsense.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:40:14.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
