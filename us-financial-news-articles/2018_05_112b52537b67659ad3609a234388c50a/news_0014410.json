(NASDAQ:ATAX) (the “Partnership”) reported the following results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nTotal assets of $1.03 billion; Total Mortgage Revenue Bond investments of $756.0 million; Total revenue of $16.5 million; Net income, basic and diluted, of 0.09 per Unit; and Cash Available for Distribution of $0.10 per Unit.\nThe Partnership reported the following notable transactions during the first quarter of 2018:\nIncreased its Investment in unconsolidated entities by $12.3 million; Redemptions of three Mortgage Revenue Bonds for approximately $10.4 million; and Entered into a Commercial Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its Jade Park MF Property.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Partnership increased its total revenue to $16.5 million, from $16.0 million in the first quarter 2017. The increase was predominantly due to an increase of approximately $1.9 million in investment income., which was partially offset by a reduction in property revenues due to MF Property sales during 2017. “We are pleased with the performance of our investments and the increase in income we have reported,” said Chad Daffer, Chief Executive Officer of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P.\nIn December 2017, the Partnership initiated an At the Market (“ATM”) offering to sell up to $75.0 million of Beneficial Unit Certificates (“BUCs”) at prevailing market prices on the date of sale. The Partnership sold an additional 38,617 BUCs under the ATM Program for net proceeds of approximately $192,000, net of issuance costs, in January 2018. On March 16, 2018, the Partnership terminated the ATM offering.\n“We are pleased with the results of the ATM offering,” said Chad Daffer, Chief Executive Office of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. “This provides the Partnership with another option in its liquidity stack and allows us to raise capital without price dilution and at substantially reduced issuance costs.”\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\nThis report refers to Cash Available for Distribution (“CAD”), which is identified as a non-GAAP financial measure. The Partnership utilizes CAD as a means to determine our ability to make distributions to unitholders. We believe CAD provides relevant information about our operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding our operating results. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although we consider CAD to be a useful measure of our operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. See the table at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP and our CAD for the periods set forth.\nEarnings Webcast/ Conference Call\nThe Partnership will host a Webcast/Earnings Call for Unitholders on Monday, May 7, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, to discuss its First Quarter 2018 results.
