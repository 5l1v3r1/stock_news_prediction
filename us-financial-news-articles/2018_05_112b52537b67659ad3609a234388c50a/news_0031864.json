We couldn’t stay to protest longer because the military would cut our access to water and electricity to pressure us to leave, so they didn’t have to worry about different groups coming out on the coup anniversary,” Prayong told Reuters on Sunday.\n“We’ll give them time for now, but we will certainly be back if things don’t improve.”\nPrayong said the group would discuss its next steps on Wednesday.\nThailand was rocked by often deadly, on-off street protests between 2008 and 2014. The ruling junta has banned public gatherings since the 2014 coup, saying its actions were necessary to keep the peace ahead of a promised general election.\nIn recent months several protests have underscored growing public frustration with the military government’s repeated postponements of the election, now set for early 2019.\nSpokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd told Reuters the government welcomed P-Move’s agreement to stop its protests. “It is a good sign that P-Move has ended its gathering. The government wants to solve problems for every group among all Thai people,” he said.\nHe added that the government is “not worried” about planned pro-democracy demonstrations later this month.\n“The election won’t be later than February next year...we will make them understand that.” Reporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Aukkarapon Niyomyat; Editing by Eric Meijer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T12:33:49.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
