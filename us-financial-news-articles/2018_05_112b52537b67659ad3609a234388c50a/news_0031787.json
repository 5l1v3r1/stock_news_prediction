It was not immediately clear if any of them would be affected by the review.\nThe funds include sovereign fund Khazanah, pension fund Employees Provident Fund (EPF), investment fund Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), retirement fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP), military retirement fund Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) and Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH), a fund for the pilgrimage to Mecca.\nThese funds control billions of dollars in assets, including significant shareholdings in some of the country’s biggest publicly traded companies, including banks.\nOn Saturday, Mahathir appointed a special team - a ‘Council of Eminent Persons’ - to advise the government on economic and financial matters for the next 100 days. Former central bank governor Zeti Akhthar Aziz, billionaire tycoon Robert Kuok, among others, were named to the team that is headed by former finance minister Daim Zainuddin.\n“For funds that had political representation on their respective board of directors, Daim reaffirmed that this will be reviewed and changed, as required,” the funds said in a joint statement, after meeting Daim on Sunday.\nDaim also sought feedback from the funds on the outlook for the economy, the market and the ringgit currency MYR= .\n“Collectively, we agreed that while the market may see some short-term volatility as it factors in changes, the outlook beyond that is positive. We highlighted the emerging consensus of independent commentators that sees this as a historic opportunity to reset the nation’s economy,” the statement said.\nDaim also said the council will be use the government-linked funds and companies to review projects and contract and other issues like toll roads.\nReporting by Liz Lee and A.
