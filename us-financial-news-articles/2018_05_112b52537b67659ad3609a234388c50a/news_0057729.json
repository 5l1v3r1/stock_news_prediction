Grand Hyatt (1,800 rooms) is the least expensive option with doubles starting at $255/night; the 300-room SLS is $295/night; and the luxury chain Rosewood has 200 rooms with doubles starting at $595/night.\nWhile it hasn't been reported what room Becca stayed in, the ocean side villa at Rosewood is the most premium room category among the three resorts, which would pamper her the most. Rates at the two-story, three-Bedroom Villa just steps from the ocean (equipped with a private pool) start at $4,970/night.\nBaha Mar One of seven pools at Baha Mar The entire complex includes more than 40 restaurants, bars and lounges; an 18-hole Jack Nicklaus-designed Signature Royal Blue golf course; a 100,000-square-foot casino with floor-to-ceiling windows for ocean views; an ESPA spa and wellness center; seven pools; boutique stores for shopping and water excursions, like SCUBA and snorkeling.\nThe restaurants range from fast casual, like Da Poke Bowl Shack, where an entree can cost between $10 to $15, to fine dining like Cleo, with $31 to $50 entrees.\nBaha Mar The 100,000-square-foot casino at Baha Mar In the ESPA spa , a 60-minute massage is $170; a 60-minute facial starts at $180.\nIn The Sanctuary, a pool with native sealife, guests can get up close to sea creatures, like turtles and sting rays, in a closed-off area for $65/session.\nThe resort is right on a white-sand beach with turquoise water. Water activities are \"complimentary,\" including clear-bottom kayaks, snorkels, paddleboards and Hobie Cat sailboats, but Baha Mar charges a daily resort fee per stay (between $32 and $48, depending on which hotel you stay at), which also offers access to non-motorized sports (like paddleboards), fitness center, free local calls and WiFi.\nThere is also a nightly $20.63 \"gratuity\" charge, which is distributed to housekeeping and bell staff.\nBaha Mar is the only resort featured in \"The Bachelorette\" to be new (open less than a year), so the timing is good for the resort.\nResorts and destinations get a \"spotlight\" in the latter half of the season, which gets them major publicity and boost in tourism , according to Town & Country magazine.\nFortune reported the media value of such spotlight treatment in a series finale at $20 million to $100 million.\nDon't miss: 5 tips to plan the perfect honeymoon, according to experts\nLike this story?
