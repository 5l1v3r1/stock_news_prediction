The fact is that they are not in a rush to raise rates faster. They may still raise rates in June. This has allowed Treasuries to bounce here and the dollar is coming off,” said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York.\nIn a statement following the end of a two-day policy meeting, the Fed also said that “on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.”\nThe dollar index fell 0.12 percent, with the euro up 0.13 percent to $1.2008.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,135.05, the S&P 500 gained 1.48 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,656.28 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.21 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,159.92.\nForecast-beating results from the world’s biggest company, Apple Inc, lifted tech shares.\nThe MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.9644 percent, down from 2.976 percent late on Tuesday.\nIn the oil market, U.S. crude rose 0.95 percent to $67.89 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.41, up 0.38 percent on the day.
