We are not and there will be value destruction in parts of retail,” Chief Executive Andrew Jones cautioned.\nThe British property company said its full year profit rose to 186 million from 63 million a year ago, helped by a 121.6 million gain from property revaluation.\nNet asset value per share rose over 10 percent to 165.2 pence per share.\nShares in the company were flat in the first hour of trading in London.
