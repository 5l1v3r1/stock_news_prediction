She sat between two senior managers, all conversations could be heard and communications were monitored, she said.\n“I followed what I believed was the right way of doing things - how I saw things being done and told by my manager Colin Bermingham,” said Bohart, who has an 11-month-old son.\nShe described Bermingham as a very caring, supportive, knowledgeable and honest man, who often drove her to the airport on a Friday so she could fly home for the weekend to be with her sick step-father and, later, to see her boyfriend.\nAt times emotional, Bohart said she had been shocked when SFO officers called her in November 2015 on her mobile phone while she was at work in Sweden, seven years after she had left Barclays in 2008.\nAsked why she had come voluntarily to be tried, she said:\n“I believe that when you have done nothing wrong it should be OK to stand and tell my story.” (Reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Mark Potter)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:06:19.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
