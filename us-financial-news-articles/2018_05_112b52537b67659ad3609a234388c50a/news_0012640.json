(\"C&J\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CJ) today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were $553.0 million, an increase of 12.5% over the fourth quarter of 2017, generating Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $73.7 million, an increase of 28.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The continued improvement in our financial results was driven by strong performance in all core businesses. First quarter sequential revenue growth over the prior quarter was 7.2% after adjusting for the impact of a full quarter of revenue from the O-Tex cementing business acquired in November 2017.\nNet income in the first quarter of 2018 of $20.6 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, was below net income of $57.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a non-routine tax benefit related to the O-Tex acquisition and a one-time net gain on the sale of our Canadian rig services business, both completed in the prior quarter. Adjusted Net Income (1) of $27.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, was 39.4% higher than Adjusted Net Income of $19.7 million in the prior quarter and reflects, among other items, the elimination of the tax benefit and gain on sale. We reported a net loss of $(32.3) million, or $(0.58) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA totaled $73.7 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $57.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Please refer to footnote one for further information on non-GAAP financial measures.\n\"Our results, delivering double-digit revenue and profitability growth in each of the last five quarters, are due to effective execution by our people. We continued the successful integration of O-Tex, delivering as expected on revenue and margins. Our strategy of aligning asset deployment to customer activity and executing effectively is delivering positive results,\" commented C&J's President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Gawick.\n\"Activity outlook is positive and falls right in line with our strategy, positioning us for growth in revenue and profitability. Our customers are indicating continued demand for our services, and market factors also support the positive outlook, as rig count and well permits continue to increase in the markets we serve. Fracturing services are currently undersupplied, and we believe a significant percentage of the horsepower additions announced by our competitors are required to replace old and non-performing pumping assets. In addition, the tight labor market continues to limit the growth of capacity, which pushes more work to the existing deployed equipment.\n\"We entered the second quarter in a strong position, and customer demand remains robust. We will deploy three additional refurbished fracturing fleets from May through July as cash flow generation and return on capital support the deployment. In addition, we anticipate growth in our other core business lines will continue. During the first quarter, we decided to exit our directional drilling business and artificial lift business to focus capital on our core service lines. We continuously monitor market conditions and actively engage with our customers. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment with targeted paybacks of less than eighteen months, and we are retaining the ability to adjust and redeploy capital as appropriate. We are excited about the prospects for C&J and expect 2018 will be an outstanding year for our company.\"\nBusiness Segment Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we revised our reporting segment structure and established our new Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, which includes results from our cementing, coiled tubing and directional drilling businesses. During the first quarter, we shut down our directional drilling business, and we are in the process of selling our inventory and technology. Our Completion Services segment now consists of our fracturing and wireline and pumping businesses, as well as our R&T division.\nCompletion Services\nIn our Completion Services segment, our first quarter 2018 revenue increased 9.0% to $374.1 million from $343.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 revenue increased 95.1% compared to revenue of $191.8 million generated in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, we reported Adjusted EBITDA of $80.9 million on net income of $57.9 million. This compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $72.6 million on net income of $50.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA of $21.7 million on net income of $10.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, all of our core Completion Services businesses continued to grow as we capitalized on improving customer activity levels, increased utilization on an expanding asset base and captured higher pricing. Our alignment with customers with significant well inventories helped us navigate the seasonality with minimal impact on our results. Although we experienced logistical challenges, we overcame them with minimal disruptions to our fracturing business due to our strategy of partnering with quality sand suppliers and then supplementing that committed capacity with spot purchasing. Building on that strategy, we do not currently expect significant issues in managing logistics or sand supply in the coming quarters. Our fracturing business benefited from a full quarter of utilization of our fourteenth frac fleet delivered in late 2017, and we also took delivery of a new-build horizontal frac fleet consisting of new Tier II pumps with refurbished ancillary equipment at the end of the quarter. Accordingly, we exited the first quarter well positioned with approximately 655,000 hydraulic horsepower deployed in our fracturing business consisting of fifteen horizontal and two vertical frac fleets. In our cased-hole wireline and pumping business, despite pockets of customer-related downtime associated with sand delivery delays, we experienced another quarter of strong customer demand and higher pricing that generated both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth. We are extremely pleased with the margins generated by our cased-hole wireline and pumping business, with profitability that exceeded our fracturing business.\nWell Construction and Intervention Services\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, which includes our coiled tubing, cementing and now discontinued directional drilling businesses, our first quarter 2018 revenue increased 55.3% to $87.4 million from $56.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 revenue increased 234.7% from revenue of $26.1 million generated in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, we reported Adjusted EBITDA of $16.0 million on net income of $5.5 million. This compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 million on net income of $29.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million on a net loss of $(0.5) million for the first quarter of 2017.\nIn our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, our first quarter results benefited from a full quarter contribution from O-Tex with the integration progressing to plan. In our coiled tubing business, demand for large diameter coil has remained strong, and we experienced increases in both utilization and pricing. Average revenue per deployed coiled tubing unit improved by 11.0% in the first quarter, primarily due to increased activity levels. Our large diameter units now account for over 80.0% of the revenue and profitability generated in our coiled tubing business. In our cementing business, despite some early delays, customer activity levels increased throughout the first quarter in the majority of our operating basins. In West Texas, both utilization and pricing of our deployed units increased as we were awarded additional work from both new and existing customers.\nWell Support Services\nIn our Well Support Services segment, which includes rig services, fluids management services, and special services, including artificial lift applications that we are in the process of exiting, and other specialty well site services, first quarter 2018 revenue decreased 0.9% to $91.4 million from $92.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 revenue decreased 5.0% from revenue of $96.3 million generated in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, we reported Adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 million on a net loss of $(8.7) million. This compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 million on a net income of $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 million on a net loss of $(6.5) million for first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Well Support Services segment revenue decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the loss of revenue from our Canadian rig services business that was divested in the fourth quarter of 2017, and to a lesser extent, our exit from the condensate hauling business in South Texas. The decisions to exit these areas, as well as our directional drilling and artificial lift businesses, reflect our returns focused philosophy of intolerance for underperforming businesses or locations and redeploying capital to achieve higher levels of profitability and targeted returns. As a result of this strategy, overall segment profitability increased by focusing on areas with improving customer demand and higher overall pricing for our services. We exited the quarter with high single digit Adjusted EBITDA margins in this segment, despite the losses associated with our artificial lift business. In our rig services business, we experienced improved activity levels in almost all core operating basins, but weather delays mitigated a portion of the revenue and profitability improvement. Weather delays also impacted our fluids management business; however, we improved both revenue and profitability due to improving activity levels and pricing, primarily in West Texas. We expect performance of our Well Support Services businesses to continue to improve due to our strategy of implementing pricing increases and exiting locations and businesses that do not achieve our targeted returns on investment.\nOther Financial Information\nOur selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $65.9 million, compared to $68.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $62.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The prior quarter included severance costs associated with the divestiture of our Canadian rig services business and integration and transaction costs associated with the O-Tex acquisition, while the first quarter included severance and accelerated stock compensation expense associated with the departure of an executive officer. Excluding these non-routine type costs, Adjusted SG&A (1) as a percentage of revenue decreased from 12.1% to 10.8%, or 130 basis points, due to operating leverage generated from higher revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $46.3 million, compared to $39.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $31.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential increase was driven by increased capital expenditures associated with equipment placed into service and the integration of O-Tex's asset base for the entire quarter.\nLiquidity and Capital Expenditures\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had a cash balance of $88.0 million and no borrowings drawn on our credit facility, which had borrowing capacity of $178.5 million. As a result, we exited the first quarter with total liquidity of $266.5 million. For the first quarter of 2018, we generated healthy cash flow from operations, even after significant outflows related to prior year activities including a tax settlement related to the legacy Nabors Completion and Production Services business associated with our emergence from the Chapter 11 restructuring.\nWe are pleased to announce that effective May 1, 2018, we successfully upsized our credit facility providing for up to $400.0 million of borrowing capacity with improved terms, including pricing, in line with market rates. Under the new facility on a proforma basis, we had borrowing capacity of $325.5 million and total liquidity of $413.5 million at quarter end. We do not anticipate needing the extra borrowing capacity in the near term, but this facility provides us with the financial flexibility to execute on our returns focused strategy for years to come.\nCapital expenditures totaled $63.0 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $58.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nConference Call Information\nWe will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET / 9:00 a.m. CT to discuss our first quarter 2018 financial and operating results.
