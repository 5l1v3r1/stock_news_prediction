Takeout food delivery is a capital-intensive business that has attracted such players as Uber and Amazon , with far bigger driver networks and logistics experience. Some investors and analysts have questioned Caviar's strategic position within Square.\nIn recent years, Square has been moving beyond hardware and deeper into financial services, even applying for a banking license. Square Capital — its loan platform for vendors — has become a contributor to the overall business and, according to management, drives greater merchant engagement across the entire Square ecosystem.\nCaviar has also been a way for the company to further integrate small businesses into its growing ecosystem. In the company's 2017 shareholder letter, CEO Jack Quote: : \"Square's expertise in point of sale, order management, and services ... help sellers grow differentiates Caviar from food delivery services.\"\nNow, Square is making it official with a dedicated platform that aims to be the only software restaurants need. Square says the software has the ability to update menus and floor layouts remotely while also offering performance tracking, tip splitting and fraud protection.\nSquare for Restaurants is the company's third point of-sale-offering, joining Square for Retail and Square Appointments for service-based businesses.\nDorsey is also CEO of Twitter.\nshow chapters Square has promising bitcoin initiatives, according one Wall Street firm 5:01 PM ET Wed, 14 March 2018 | 00:52", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T18:01:30.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
