That was kind of the scary moment that created a valuation opportunity and have held it ever since,\" he added.\nApple , which was last trading just under $190 per share, is widely expected to become the first company worth $1 trillion. The stock is roughly $13 (7 percent) away from notching the historic milestone and currently boasts a market cap of $933.88 billion. Shares are up 24 percent over the past 12 months, well ahead of the S&P 500's gain.\nShares of the Cupertino, California, company have resumed their upward climb following a strong earnings report and the news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had bought an additional 75 million shares in the first quarter.\nBuffett also chastised investors for their preoccupation with iPhone sales , saying \"The idea that you're going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone Xs ... are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point.\"\nDespite his largely bullish outlook, George said that at its current price, Apple no longer represents a \"screaming buy\" and that he recently trimmed his holdings as the stock notched all-time highs.\n\"If it were to fall back to $120 or $130 it would [present a strong opportunity]. At $200 and up, maybe it's not such a great idea anymore,\" he said. \"I run a portfolio typically between 40 and 50 stocks, I do manage the risk by capping positions at 5 percent. Recently, Apple has kind of reached that and been pruned a little bit in the portfolio.\"\nGeorge is the senior managing director of Sprott Incorporated and chairman of Sprott US Holdings as well as portfolio manager of Sprott Focus Trust, an equity fund that holds a focused portfolio of value stocks of all sizes. Prior to his role at Sprott, he spent 23 years in senior roles at Royce & Associates.
