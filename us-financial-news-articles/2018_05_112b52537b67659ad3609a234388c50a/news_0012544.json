Sales growth in the unit has averaged about 33 percent in the last five quarters.\nThe results come after the company in March settled with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp and agreed to add two directors, including former Amazon.com chief information security officer Tom Killalea.\nThe company also set up a financial operation committee to lift its operating margin to 30 percent by 2020.\n“With the recent involvement of Elliott Management, margins now look poised to reverse the downward trend seen over recent years,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a pre-earnings note.\nThe company, which has already cut 5 percent of its global workforce, could announce reduction in facilities at its Analyst Day on June 26, Leighton said on a call with analysts.\nAkamai forecast second-quarter revenue of $658 million to $670 million and adjusted profit of 79 cents to 83 cents per share.\nAnalysts on average had estimated revenue of $656.8 million and profit of 70 cents per share.\nRevenue rose 11.4 percent to $668.7 million in the first quarter, beating estimate of $654 million\nBut net income fell 28 percent to $53.7 million on a $15 million restructuring charge and $23 million settlement related to a legal dispute.\nExcluding items, earnings were 79 cents per share, topping estimate of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru: Editing by Arun Koyyur and Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T00:06:17.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
