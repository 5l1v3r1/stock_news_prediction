One out later, Desmond belted a three-run homer to center field, putting the Rockies ahead for good at 3-1.\nThe home run was Desmond’s seventh of the season.\nDesmond made it 4-1 in the sixth with a two-out, ground-rule double, again scoring Arenado, who had led off the inning with a double.\nThe Giants threatened to cut into the deficit in the seventh, when Evan Longoria and Brandon Crawford singled to bring the potential tying run to the plate with two outs.\nBut Shaw replaced Freeland at that point and caught Belt looking on a full count, retaining the three-run lead.\nBelt, who had homered in each of his previous four games, was pinch hitting for Austin Jackson. Belt was held out of the starting lineup due to a swollen knee.\nCharlie Blackmon added to the Colorado lead with a two-run home run off Giants reliever Jose Valdez in the ninth, scoring Gerardo Parra, who had singled as a pinch hitter.\nBlackmon’s homer was his 12th of the year.\nFreeland held the Giants to five hits in his 6 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out five.\nHolland went six innings, allowing four runs and six hits. He walked one and struck out three.\nDesmond, Arenado and Story had two hits apiece for the Rockies, who have won eight of their last nine road games.\nHernandez’s home run, his third of the season, was the Giants’ only extra-base hit. It came on Freeland’s third pitch of the game.\nThe Rockies out-hit the Giants 10-5.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:20:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
