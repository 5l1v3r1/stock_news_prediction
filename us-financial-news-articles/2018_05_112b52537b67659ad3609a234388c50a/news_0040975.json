But some community groups are concerned that easing the rules could discourage lending in lower-income communities.\nBrainard said updated rules could ease burdens for banks while also encouraging them to engage in effective lending to underserved areas.\n“I am confident that there are ways to update the areas where we evaluate a bank’s CRA performance without losing the core focus on place,” she said in New York, according to prepared remarks.\nBrainard said existing CRA rules could be streamlined and made more predictable, while also tailoring them to better allow banks to take different approaches to doing business in various communities.\n“We will want to maintain the flexibility to ensure that, no matter the business line, a bank can meet its CRA obligation by doing what it has the expertise to do well,” she said.\nUpdated rules should also acknowledge technological developments have changed how banks engage in local lending, she said. For example, Brainard noted online lenders are evaluated for CRA compliance based on how they serve the area around their business operations, despite the fact that they lend nationwide.\nBrainard’s comments come after the Treasury Department recommended relaxing penalties against banks that have shortcomings in CRA compliance, as long as the bank is working to address the problem.\nBrainard said the Fed is working with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on a joint update to the rules. Comptroller Joseph Otting has said he would like to propose updated rules in the coming weeks.
