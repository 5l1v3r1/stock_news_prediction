A key product is the company's Zi App Blockchain Payment Gateway. Originally designed to facilitate digital payments in cannabis, this system has earned overwhelming interest as a payment solution for even larger markets, like multi-level marketing, commercial leases and equipment rentals. The new company would be free to negotiate licensing and strategic partnerships without the association of cannabis.\n\"As it stands, we feel these assets are undervalued in the context of the cannabis company, so we are seeking a platform to launch our technology in new markets beyond the scope of Alternate Health's cannabis focus,\" says Dr. Murphy. \"An uplisting would give us the shareholder value and market liquidity to take on these exciting market opportunities and deliver shareholders an additional opportunity for a strong return on their investment.\"\nAlternate Health Labs would also be included in the new company, since it forms another revenue-generating, non-cannabis asset. The new company would be able to negotiate greater referral contracts for the business, while applying its expertise in blockchain development to software and management systems across the healthcare industry.\nAlternate Health's Future in Cannabis\nSpinning off the company's blockchain payment and laboratory assets is expected to have a dramatic impact on Alternate Health's cannabis businesses. This process will free up the company to immediately focus on generating revenue from of our CBD products, with Alternate Health already pursuing production and distribution deals in California, Canada and Mexico. A cannabis-focused Alternate Health will also be free provide software services to recreational markets across the United States and Canada.\n\"We expect this change will position Alternate Health's cannabis assets for explosive growth as we are free to expand our operations into production and distribution,\" says Dr. Murphy. \"This restructuring would allow us fully monetize all our cannabis assets, including software, CBD products, patented delivery systems and education.\"\nProposal Specifics\nWhile still subject to board and regulatory approval, including shareholder approval if required, the plan would see all cannabis-specific assets remain in Alternate Health. This includes the subsidiaries of Alternate Health Inc., Alternate Medical Media, LLC, and Alternate Health Life Sciences, LLC. Alternate Health USA Inc. and Alternate Health Labs Inc.* would be spun off to form a new public company, which would apply to be listed on an American exchange.\nAlternate Health is in the process of preparing complete and representative prospectuses for the proposed spin-off. Separating the companies will materially affect the company's financial projections for 2018. For this reason, management would like to retract previously reported projections for 2018 and, in the near future, issue revised projections for the new companies. For the first time, the company will report projections for individual business lines as opposed to the company as a whole. Alternate Health's goal is to make these projections available to the public in six to eight weeks.\n*Note: The spinoff of the Company's laboratory business would affect Alternate Health's previously stated revenue projections, and once the details of the spin off plan are confirmed, the Company will update on how the plan is expected to impact previously disclosed revenue projections.\nGeneral terms of the proposed plan:\nNewCo will apply to be listed on an American exchange. Management will seriously consider legal and accounting advice to create an ownership structure that best maintains shareholder valuations, while maximizing tax efficiencies. As a preliminary plan, no timetable has been set and final agreements are still subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval and considerations of tax, corporate and securities matters in the United States and Canada.\nAbout Alternate Health\nAlternate Health Corp.
