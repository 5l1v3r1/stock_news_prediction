Shi’ite Muslim movement Hezbollah, together with parties and politicians aligned to it, won more than half the 128 seats in Lebanon’s parliament in its election this month.\nThe country is also seen as vulnerable because of its hard currency debt levels, among the highest in emerging markets.\nReporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
