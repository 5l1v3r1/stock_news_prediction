This included a significant award from a European Tier 1 service provider as well as a new customer in India for development services tied to CORD initiatives. We also experienced ongoing strength in software deployments of MediaEngine with our largest channel partner via multiple new end-customer awards.\n“In addition to our growing pipeline and improving customer conversion rate, we made fundamental progress toward transforming our cost structure and balance sheet. Importantly, our first quarter results do not yet fully reflect the significant enhancements to the business that we have made. Closing our new financing arrangements has enabled us to realign our operating model and reduce anticipated second quarter expenses by over 30% as compared to the third quarter of 2017. Coupled with increased revenue growth in our Software-Systems business, which will drive gross margin expansion over time, we remain on track to deliver quarterly non-GAAP profitability in the second half of 2018.”\nSoftware-Systems Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Software-Systems revenue was $11.1 million, compared to $14.8 million in the prior quarter and $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross margin was 49.2%, compared to 53.9% in the prior quarter and 53.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating loss was $3.1 million, compared to operating income of $0.6 million in the prior quarter and an operating loss of $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nHardware Solutions Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Hardware Solutions revenue was $15.0 million, compared to $17.5 million in the prior quarter and $27.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included approximately $5 million associated with previously anticipated legacy customer last-time builds.\nGross margin was 20.7%, compared to (26.7)% in the prior quarter and 17.4% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income was $1.0 million, compared to an operating loss of $9.6 million in the prior quarter and an operating loss of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nConsolidated Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, consolidated revenue was $26.2 million, compared to $32.3 million in the prior quarter and $37.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 26.6%, compared to 4.2% in the prior quarter and 21.9% in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses were $11.0 million, compared to $12.7 million in the prior quarter and $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decline in operating expenses over the comparable periods was primarily the result of previously announced restructuring actions associated with the Company’s Hardware Solutions business.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, first quarter 2018 gross margin was 32.8%, compared to 40.4% in the prior quarter and 27.2% in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses on a non-GAAP basis were $10.7 million, compared to $12.3 million in the prior quarter and $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a GAAP net loss of $6.4 million, or ($0.16) per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $19.6 million, or ($0.50) per share, in the prior quarter and a GAAP net loss of $10.0 million, or ($0.26) per share, in the first quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded a net loss of $3.3 million, or ($0.08) per share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million, or ($0.01) per share, in the prior quarter and a net loss of $5.5 million, or ($0.14) per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Financial Guidance\nRevenue is expected to be between $20 and $22 million. Note the first quarter of 2018 included approximately $5 million associated with legacy customer last-time build revenue recognized in the first quarter. GAAP gross margin is expected to approximate 29%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 37% and 41% of sales. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $9.5 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $9 million. GAAP loss is expected to range from ($0.18) to ($0.12) per share. Non-GAAP loss is expected to range from ($0.08) to ($0.02) per share. Both GAAP and non-GAAP loss per share are based on a projected 40 million shares outstanding.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on May 1, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

Actual results could the outlook guidance and expectations in these as a result of a number of risk factors which are outlined in the Company’s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), copies of which may be obtained by contacting the Company at 503-615-1100, from the Company's investor relations web site at http://investor.radisys.com/ , or at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov . Although help provide additional information about Radisys, investors should keep in mind that are inherently less reliable than historical information. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize (or the other consequences of such a development worsen), or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forecasted or expected. The Company believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. All information in this press release is as of the date of this release. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the Company's expectations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain expenses, gains and losses, such as the effects of (a) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expense, (c) restructuring and other charges (reversals), net, (d) non-cash income tax expense, (e) restructuring inventory adjustment, (f) amortization of financing activities expenses, and (g) change in fair value of warrants. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of its current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring the Company's performance, and the Company believes that it is providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to its internal measurement processes. These non-GAAP measures are considered to be reflective of the Company's core operating results as they more closely reflect the essential revenue-generating activities of the Company and direct operating expenses (resulting in cash expenditures) needed to perform these revenue-generating activities. The Company also believes, based on feedback provided to the Company during its earnings calls' Q&A sessions and discussions with the investment community, that the non-GAAP financial measures it provides are necessary to allow the investment community to construct their valuation models to better align its results and projections with its competitors and market sector, as there is significant variability and unpredictability across companies with respect to certain expenses, gains and losses.\nThe non-GAAP financial information is presented using a consistent methodology from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP information is included in the tables below. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nRadisys® is a

range Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 GAAP $ 9.5 (b) Stock-based compensation 0.4 Non-GAAP $ 9.1 Non-GAAP financial measures includes the performance of Software-Systems and Embedded Products and Hardware Services. The Company excludes the following corporate and other expenses, reversals, gains and losses from its non-GAAP financial measures, when applicable:\n(a) Amortization of acquired intangible assets: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets primarily relate to core and existing technologies, trade name and customer relationships that were acquired with the acquisitions of Continuous Computing and Pactolus. The Company excludes the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because it does not reflect the Company's ongoing business and it does not have a direct correlation to the operation of the Company's business. In addition, in accordance with GAAP, the Company generally recognizes expenses for internally-developed intangible assets as they are incurred, notwithstanding the potential future benefit such assets may provide. Unlike internally-developed intangible assets, however, and also in accordance with GAAP, the Company generally capitalizes the cost of acquired intangible assets and recognizes that cost as an expense over the useful lives of the assets acquired. As a result of their GAAP treatment, there is an inherent lack of comparability between the financial performance of internally-developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, the Company believes it is useful to provide, as a supplement to its GAAP operating results, non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles in order to enhance the period-over-period comparison of its operating results, as there is significant variability and unpredictability across companies with respect to this expense.\n(b) Stock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation consists of expenses recorded under GAAP, in connection with stock awards such as stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted under the Company's equity incentive plans and shares issued pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plan. The Company excludes stock-based compensation from non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash measurement that does not reflect the Company's ongoing business and because the Company believes that investors want to understand the impact on the Company of the adoption of the applicable GAAP surrounding share based payments; the Company believes that the provision of non-GAAP information that excludes stock-based compensation improves the ability of investors to compare its period-over-period operating results, as there is significant variability and unpredictability across companies with respect to this expense.\n(c) Restructuring and other charges, net: Restructuring and other charges, net relates to costs associated with non-recurring events. These include costs incurred for employee severance, acquisition or divestiture activities, excess facility costs, certain legal costs, asset related charges and other expenses associated with business restructuring activities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. The Company does not engage in restructuring activities in the ordinary course of business. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from its non-GAAP financial measures because it enhances the ability of investors to compare the Company's period-over-period operating results.\n(d) Income taxes: Non-GAAP income tax expense is equal to the Company's projected cash tax expense. Adjustments to GAAP income tax expense are required to eliminate the recognition of tax expense from profitable entities where we utilize deferred tax assets to offset current period tax liabilities. We believe that providing this non-GAAP figure is useful to our investors as it more closely represents the true economic impact of our tax positions.\n(e) Restructuring inventory adjustment: Includes inventory write-downs and benefits associated with non-recurring events, predominantly tied to the Company’s decision to end-of-life or discontinue certain products for which the Company has no future ongoing demand. During 2017, the Company recorded such charges tied to discrete product decisions within its Hardware-Solutions segment associated with its DCEngine and certain legacy embedded products. Restructuring inventory write-downs and benefits are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although the Company has incurred various inventory write-downs over the past several years, they have generally been associated with ongoing business activities. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude end-of-life and product discontinuance inventory write-downs and benefits related to those write-downs from its non-GAAP financial measures because it enhances the ability of investors to compare the Company's period-over-period operating results.\n(f) Amortization of financing activities: Amortization of financing activities consists of expenses recorded under GAAP related to the amortization of debt issuance costs, the amortization of warrant issuance costs, and terminations costs related to previous unamortized debt issuance costs from terminated financing agreements. The Company excludes amortization of financing activities because they are not considered to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore is excluded from our non-GAAP results.\n(g) Change in fair value of warrants: Represents the change to the current fair value of the warranty liability. The Company excludes the change in fair value of warrants from non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash measurement that does not reflect the Company's ongoing business. The Company believes that the provision of non-GAAP information that excludes changes in fair value of warrants improves the ability of investors to compare its period-over-period operating results, as there is significant variability and unpredictability based on the current fair value of the underlying warrants.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006450/en/\nCompany Contact\nRadisys Corporation\nJon Wilson, 503-615-1685\nChief Financial Officer\njon.wilson@radisys.com\nor\nInvestor Contact\nShelton Group\nBrett L.
