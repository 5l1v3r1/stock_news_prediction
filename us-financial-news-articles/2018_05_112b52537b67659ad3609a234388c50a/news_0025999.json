(NASDAQ:NMIH), the parent company of National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (National MI), this year celebrates the fifth anniversary of its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ Exchange. Yesterday, Chairman and CEO Bradley Shuster rang the closing bell at NASDAQ MarketSite in Times Square to commemorate the milestone.\nNMI Holdings, Inc. Executives and Board Ring the NASDAQ Closing Bell\n“National MI has grown significantly since its IPO in 2013 and yesterday’s ceremony was a memorable way to celebrate our success,” Shuster said. “Six years ago, I set out to create a new company with a fresh and innovative approach to underwriting private mortgage insurance and that wasn’t burdened with the losses from the housing downturn. The goal was to help lenders create more homeownership opportunities for Americans.”\nNational MI has achieved that goal: to date the company has helped more than 260,000 borrowers achieve their dream of homeownership. The company has grown from 141 employees in 2013 to over 300 today. It has also steadily grown its customer base and now works with more than 900 lenders.\n“In 2013, we generated $1 billion of new insurance written. In 2017, we generated more than $21 billion, and we just reported our best first quarter ever with new insurance written of $6.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018,” Shuster said.\nNational MI has been a leader in the private mortgage insurance business with its innovative approach to underwriting and understanding risk. In 2013, the company introduced groundbreaking new insurance coverage that shortened the industry-standard timeframe for rescission relief from 36 months to 12 months for the majority of National MI insured loans. The pioneering approach to underwriting served as the basis for National MI SafeGuard® and started a trend in the industry.\n“In the early stages of National MI, we hired some of the best and brightest people in the industry and continue to do so today,” Shuster said. “Our employees have been instrumental to our success. National MI has been repeatedly recognized with individual or company awards over the past five years. We have a lot to be proud of.”\nAbout National MI\nNational Mortgage Insurance Corporation (National MI), a subsidiary of NMI Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:NMIH), is a U.S.-based, private mortgage insurance company enabling low down payment borrowers to realize home ownership while protecting lenders and investors against losses related to a borrower’s default.
