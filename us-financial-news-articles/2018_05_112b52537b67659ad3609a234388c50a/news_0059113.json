Adjusted EBITDA (2) of $0.7 million ($0.00 basic and diluted per share) compared to $2.1 million ($0.01 basic and diluted per share) during Q1 of 2017. On January 4, 2018, the Company announced the results of an updated feasibility study to process heap leach materials and additional open-pit mineral reserves at its Mineral Ridge property.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company’s only source of revenue, the 70% owned Mineral Ridge mine, suspended mining in November 2017 as the Company had mined all of its economical mineral reserves based on gold pricing and heap leach recovery parameters. Remaining reserves are determined uneconomical to continue mining with the existing processing infrastructure due to higher associated strip ratios and heap leach recoveries and will require higher gold prices or mill processing to be considered economical. Management expects to generate limited revenues from residual but diminishing gold recoveries from the leach pads until approximately July 2018. As a result, the Company’s revenues from operations have been and continue to be adversely affected, and cash flow from operations will soon be insufficient to support the Company. In addition, the principal of $6.0 million of the Company’s long-term debt matures in August 2018. In light of this situation, the Company does not expect that it will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations to continue as a going concern in the near future. The Company will need to raise additional capital in the coming months in order to support its operations and to settle its long-term debt.\nOutlook\nThe Company’s main focus is to raise sufficient financing to improve its financial position and to re-finance its long-term debt obligations and as such allow it to proceed with the construction of a new processing facility at Mineral Ridge with a view to process heap leach materials and additional open-pit mineral reserves.\nFinancial Advisory Engagement\nThe Company has appointed MPA Morrison Park Advisors to act as an exclusive financial advisor to assist Scorpio Gold with consideration of certain strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, a potential merger, amalgamation, plan of arrangement, joint venture or other similar transaction.\n(1) This is a non-IFRS measure; please see Non-IFRS performance measures section.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nThe discussion of financial results in this press release includes reference to adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBITDA and total cash cost per ounce of gold sold, each of which are non-IFRS measures. The Company provides these measures as additional information regarding the Company's financial results and performance. Please refer to the Company's MD&A for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 for definitions of these terms and a reconciliation of these measures to reported International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) results.\nAbout Scorpio Gold Corporation\nScorpio Gold holds a 70% interest in the Mineral Ridge gold mining operation located in Esmeralda County, Nevada with joint venture partner Elevon, LLC (30%).
