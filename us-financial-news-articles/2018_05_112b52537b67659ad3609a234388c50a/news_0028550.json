I was interested in attending because I had a real passion for business news, but you don't have to know a lot about business news to attend. \"In fact, I've learned most about the industry after coming here and working through my rotations as a news associate.\"\nThe workshop was the first place where I learned about all the different rotations you can do in the program and it was actually really immersive and very interactive. We talked to a lot of business veterans and leaders in the industry and we also got to do a simulation that showed us how the newsroom works here, which is with a lot of energy and synergy.\nSo if you have any interest in business news or are interested in just learning more about being a journalist, then this is definitely a workshop that you should apply for.\" Business News Associate Workshop at #AAJA18 | Houston | Aug 10 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T10:35:23.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
