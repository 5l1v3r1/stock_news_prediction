A spokesperson for the firm could not be reached for comment.\nHeir apparent Koo is from the fourth generation of the controlling family of South Korea’s fourth-largest conglomerate, or chaebol. He owns 6 percent of LG Corp and was lately working as a senior official at LG Electronics Inc.\nLG is not the country’s only family-run conglomerate planning generational succession.\nHyundai Motor Group this month proposed a restructuring plan in preparation for a father-to-son handover. Proxy advisors rejected the plan, saying it would benefit members of the conglomerate’s controlling family but not minority shareholders. [nL3N1SL71E]\nSamsung Electronics Co Ltd, the flagship unit of Samsung Group, named heir Jay Y. Lee as director in 2016 after his father, the firm’s chairman, suffered a heart attack.\nLee was arrested last year on bribery and embezzlement charges. He has denied charges and was released from jail in February after a court suspended his sentence. [nL3N1SH21G]\nThe families controlling chaebols have been the subject of public anger this year after allegations of bad behavior among members of the family controlling Korean Air Lines Co Ltd.
