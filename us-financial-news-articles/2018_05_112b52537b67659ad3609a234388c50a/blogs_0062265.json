The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\nTrump has offered a variety of reasons for firing the FBI director, which he did by letter on May 9 , 2017. Two days after dismissing the embattled law enforcement officer, Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that the FBI's Russia investigation was on his mind during the firing.\n\"And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won,'\" Trump said at the time.\nTrump Lester Holt tweet\nEarlier in May 2018, the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump fired Comey because he would not say that Trump was not a target of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election .\n\"He fired Comey because Comey would not — among other things — say that he wasn't a target of the investigation,\" Giuliani said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\nIn the letter firing Comey, Trump wrote that Comey told him on three occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey confirmed telling Trump he was not under investigation in congressional testimony.\nThe president's comments come a day after new reports that zero in on the time Comey was fired . Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe , who was dismissed earlier this year, reportedly had written a memo saying that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told him that he was asked to include a reference to the Russia investigation in his own critical memo on Comey.\nThe final version, which Trump cited when he fired Comey, didn't mention Russia and focused instead on the former FBI director's handling of the Clinton email case.\nRobert Mueller , the special counsel, is investigating whether the president obstructed justice by firing Comey, a position on which legal experts are divided. Trump has repeatedly denied that he committed obstruction.\nRosenstein appointed Mueller to the post days after Trump fired Comey.\nSince his firing, Comey has published a book about his dealings with Trump, and has been an outspoken critic of the president.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\nMinority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., took to Twitter to troll the president over his remarks.\n\"Let's go to the videotape,\" the senator wrote, including a clip of Trump's interview with Holt.\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, told CNN on Thursday morning that he didn't know what Trump had in mind when he fired Comey.\n\"The fact that he might have had a lot of things on his mind, including the fact that he believed that the Russia thing was made up, still doesn't negate the fact that he had adequate reason to fire him, and that he had adequate authority to fire him.\"", "external_links": ["https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3711116/White-House-Fires-James-Comey.pdf", "https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/863024119331389441", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1002160516733853696"], "published": "2018-05-31T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:10:49.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
