Tony Wolters led off with a walk and Cuevas hit a one-out triple into the right field corner to give Colorado the lead.\nWandy Peralta relieved starter Sal Romano (2-6) and got Charlie Blackmon to pop out and David Dahl to fly out to keep it a one-run game.\nRomano allowed five runs on eight hits and struck out five in 5 1/3 innings.\nGray got the win after an efficient top of the sixth inning. He needed 91 pitches to get through the first five innings but retired the side in order in the sixth on only nine pitches. He finished with eight strikeouts and walked three.\nCincinnati couldn’t mount any rallies against the Colorado bullpen. Tucker Barnhart had a leadoff single in the seventh off Mike Dunn but was wiped out on a double play the next batter. Suarez was stranded at second after a leadoff single in the eighth off righty Adam Ottavino.\nThe Reds jumped ahead on Gray with two runs in the first. Scooter Gennett had an RBI single, and Scott Schebler’s ground out drove in another.\nArenado cut the lead in half with a solo homer in the bottom of the first, his ninth.\nSuarez made it 4-1 in the third with his ninth homer, a two-run shot to right-center field, but Colorado rallied in the bottom of the frame to tie it. Gerardo Parra had a two-run single and Wolters drew a bases-loaded walk off Romano to make it 4-4.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:40:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
