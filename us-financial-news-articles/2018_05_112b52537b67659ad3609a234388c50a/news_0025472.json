The U.S. embargo is also an ongoing obstacle for trade with Cuba’s northern neighbor.\n“The dredging project should complete its next phase by the end of this semester, which will enable us to receive post-Panamax ships that are 335 meters in length,” Baker told a news conference at the port.\nHe added that dredging would continue and finish next year, allowing ships that are 366 meters long to use the terminal.\nIt would have been practically impossible to make the Havana port suitable for receiving such large ships because of a traffic tunnel under the channel.\nThe Mariel terminal, with its four hulking post-Panamax cranes visible from afar, has the capacity to handle around 800,000 cargo containers annually, compared to Havana’s 350,000.\nCuba hopes to develop the Mariel industrial park in order to ship more Cuban exports from the terminal, too.
