REUTERS/Russell Cheyne/File Photo\nThe Irn Bru ban at Trump Turnberry, a sprawling estate on the west coast of Scotland with dramatic sea views, was confirmed to local newspaper the Ayrshire Post by the resort’s general manager Ralph Porciani.\n“We can’t have it staining when to replace the ballroom carpet would be 500,000 pounds ($678,800) alone,” Porciani was quoted as saying.\n“We have villas here with Irn Bru stains in the carpets which I can’t let,” he said.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo\nUnderlining the seriousness of the issue, The Scotsman, a venerable national newspaper, ran an editorial column entitled “An unfortunate stain on Trump’s reputation”.\n“The resort may have ballroom carpets to protect but surely the stain on Trump’s reputation from this ill-considered decision is much, much worse,” the newspaper wrote.
