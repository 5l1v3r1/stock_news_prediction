(NYSE: MTOR ) today reported financial results for its second fiscal 2018.\nSecond-Quarter Highlights\nSales of $1,066 million Net the company and net income from continuing operations attributable to the company of $57 million, or $0.63 per diluted share Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to the company of $68 million, or $0.75 per adjusted diluted share Adjusted EBITDA of $122 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.4 percent\nSecond-Quarter Results\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, Meritor posted sales of $1,066 million, up $260 million or approximately 32 percent, from the same period last year. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher production in all of our major markets. Sales for the quarter were also favorably impacted by new business wins and favorable foreign currency.\nNet the company and net income from continuing operations attributable to the company were $57 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $22 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Higher net income year over year was driven primarily by conversion on increased revenue.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to the company in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $68 million, or $0.75 per adjusted diluted share, compared to $32 million, or $0.35 per adjusted diluted share, in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $122 million, compared to $82 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 11.4 percent, compared to 10.2 percent in the same period last year. Higher adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin year over year were driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, $11 million of lower pension and retiree medical benefits and a one-time $10 million legal charge related to a dispute with a joint venture in the prior year that did not repeat. These increases were partially offset by incremental environmental reserves of $8 million principally related to a legacy site and $5 million of lower affiliate earnings arising from the sale of the company's interest in the Meritor WABCO joint venture in the previous year.\nCash flow provided by operating activities in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $39 million, a decrease of $5 million from the same period a year ago. Free cash flow was $22 million compared to $21 million in the same period last year.\nReportable Segment Changes\nOn March 12, 2018, the company's reportable segments were modified. As of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, Meritor's reportable segments are:\nCommercial Truck & Trailer Aftermarket & Industrial\nPrior year reportable segment financial results have been recast for these changes.\nSecond-Quarter Segment Results\nCommercial Truck & Trailer sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $854 million, up $236 million or 38 percent, compared to the same period last year. The increase in sales was primarily driven by higher production in all of our major markets. Higher sales in the quarter were also driven by the continued benefits from new business wins, as well as favorable foreign currency.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the Commercial Truck & Trailer segment was $96 million for the quarter, up $44 million from the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.2 percent, up from 8.4 percent in the same period last year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, a one-time legal charge related to a dispute with a joint venture in the prior year that did not repeat and the favorable impact of changes to retiree medical benefits, partially offset by higher variable compensation and lower affiliate earnings arising from the sale of the company's interest in the Meritor WABCO joint venture in the previous year.\nThe Aftermarket & Industrial segment posted sales of $256 million, up $30 million from the same period a year ago. The increase in sales was primarily driven by higher sales in our Industrial business, which included sales from the business that was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for Aftermarket & Industrial was $36 million for the quarter, up $4 million from the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 14.1 percent from 14.2 percent in the same period last year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the favorable impact of changes to retiree medical benefits, partially offset by higher material and freight costs.\nOutlook for Fiscal Year 2018\nThe company's guidance for fiscal year 2018 has been revised from the prior quarter as follows:\nRevenue to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion. Net the company to be in the range of $130 million to $145 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 11.2 percent. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.85. Operating cash flow to be in the range of $220 million to $235 million. Free cash flow to be in the range of $120 million to $135 million.\n\"With the revenue tailwinds we expect to continue in the second half, in addition to new business and market share wins, our full year guidance has improved measurably,\" said Jay Craig, CEO and president. \"We believe that our performance in fiscal 2018 will put us very close to achieving our M2019 earnings per share target a year early.\"\nSecond-Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call\nMeritor, Inc. will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the company's second-quarter results for fiscal year 2018 on Thursday, May 3 at 9 a.m. ET.\nTo participate, call (844) 412-1003 (within the United States) or (216) 562-0450 (international) at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.

These are made only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. All earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis. The company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest Sept. 30, and its fiscal quarters generally end on the Sundays nearest Dec. 31, March 31 and June 30. All year and quarter references relate to the company's fiscal year and fiscal quarters, unless otherwise stated.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we have provided information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the company, adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, segment adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and net debt.\nAdjusted income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the company and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations are defined as reported income (loss) from continuing operations and reported diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations before restructuring expenses, asset impairment charges, non-cash tax expense related to the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with net operating loss carry forwards, and other special items as determined by management. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures, loss on sale of receivables, restructuring expenses, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated sales from continuing operations. Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures, loss on sale of receivables, restructuring expense, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management. Segment adjusted EBITDA excludes unallocated legacy and corporate expense (income), net. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as segment adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated sales from continuing operations, either in the aggregate or by segment as applicable. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by (used for) operating activities less capital expenditures. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the company's financial position and results of operations. In particular, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, segment adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the company and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations are meaningful measures of performance to investors as they are commonly utilized to analyze financial performance in our industry, perform analytical comparisons, benchmark performance between periods and measure our performance against externally communicated targets.\nFree cash flow is used by investors and management to analyze our ability to service and repay debt and return value directly to shareholders. Net debt over adjusted EBITDA is a specific financial measure in our current M2019 plan used to measure the company's leverage in order to assist management in its assessment of appropriate allocation of capital.\nManagement uses the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting purposes, and segment adjusted EBITDA is also used as the primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments.\nOur Board of Directors uses adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations and net debt over adjusted EBITDA as key metrics to determine management's performance under our performance-based compensation plans.\nAdjusted income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the company, adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our financial performance. Free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for cash provided by (used for) operating activities, or other cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of financial position or liquidity. In addition, this non-GAAP cash flow measure does not reflect cash used to repay debt or cash received from the divestitures of businesses or sales of other assets and thus does not reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses. Net debt should not be considered a substitute for total debt as reported on the balance sheet. These non-GAAP financial measures, as determined and presented by the company, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nMERITOR, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nSix Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nSales\n$\n1,066\n$\n806\n$\n1,969\n$\n1,505\nCost of sales\n(888)\n(685)\n(1,651)\n(1,295)\nGROSS MARGIN\n178\n121\n318\n210\nSelling, general and administrative\n(74)\n(66)\n(141)\n(119)\nRestructuring costs\n(1)\n(4)\n(3)\n(4)\nOther operating expense, net\n(11)\n(2)\n(12)\n(5)\nOPERATING INCOME\n92\n49\n162\n82\nOther expense, net\n—\n—\n(1)\n—\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n6\n8\n11\n18\nInterest expense, net\n(16)\n(21)\n(40)\n(42)\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n82\n36\n132\n58\nProvision for income taxes\n(22)\n(13)\n(105)\n(19)\nINCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n60\n23\n27\n39\nLOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, net of tax\n—\n—\n(1)\n—\nNET INCOME\n60\n23\n26\n39\nLess: Net noncontrolling interests\n(3)\n(1)\n(5)\n(2)\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO MERITOR, INC.\n$\n57\n$\n22\n$\n21\n$\n37\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO MERITOR, INC.\nNet income from continuing operations\n$\n57\n$\n22\n$\n22\n$\n37\nLoss from discontinued operations\n—\n—\n(1)\n—\nNet income\n$\n57\n$\n22\n$\n21\n$\n37\nDILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nContinuing operations\n$\n0.63\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.41\nDiscontinued operations\n—\n—\n(0.01)\n—\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n0.63\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.41\nDiluted average common shares outstanding\n91.2\n92.0\n91.3\n90.2\nMERITOR, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\n(Unaudited)\n(in millions)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents (1)\n$\n100\n$\n88\nRestricted cash\n9\n—\nReceivables, trade and other, net (1)\n581\n789\nInventories (1)\n455\n378\nOther current assets\n41\n43\nTOTAL CURRENT ASSETS\n1,186\n1,298\nNET PROPERTY (1)\n459\n474\nGOODWILL (1)\n418\n414\nOTHER ASSETS (1)\n532\n596\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$\n2,595\n$\n2,782\nLIABILITIES, MEZZANINE EQUITY AND EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nShort-term debt\n$\n77\n$\n288\nAccounts and notes payable (1)\n692\n622\nOther current liabilities\n249\n272\nTOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES\n1,018\n1,182\nLONG-TERM DEBT\n728\n750\nRETIREMENT BENEFITS\n291\n314\nOTHER LIABILITIES\n244\n239\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n2,281\n2,485\nMEZZANINE EQUITY:\nConvertible debt with cash settlement\n2\n2\nEQUITY:\nCommon stock (March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, 102.1 and 101.4 shares issued and\n87.9 and 88.6 shares outstanding, respectively)\n102\n101\nAdditional paid-in capital\n775\n765\nRetained earnings\n104\n83\nTreasury stock, at cost (March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, 14.2 and 12.8 shares, respectively)\n(169)\n(136)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(530)\n(545)\nTotal equity attributable to Meritor, Inc.\n282\n268\nNoncontrolling interests (1)\n30\n27\nTOTAL EQUITY\n312\n295\nTOTAL LIABILITIES, MEZZANINE EQUITY AND EQUITY\n$\n2,595\n$\n2,782\n(1) As of March 31, 2018, Assets and liabilities held for sale consisted of $3 million Net property.
