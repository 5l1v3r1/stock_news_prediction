JOHN'S, Newfoundland and Labrador, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) (NYSE:FTS)\nFortis Inc. (\"Fortis\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX:FTS) (NYSE:FTS), a leader in the North American regulated electric and gas utility industry, released its first quarter results today. The Corporation reported first quarter 2018 net earnings of $323 million, or $0.77 per common share, and adjusted net earnings 1 of $293 million, or $0.69 per common share.\nThe difference between reported net earnings and adjusted net earnings for the first quarter 2018 was largely due to a favourable one-time $30 million remeasurement of the Corporation's deferred income tax liabilities as a result of an election to file a consolidated state income tax return.\n\"We are off to a good start in 2018 from both an operational and financial perspective with first quarter performance aligned with our expectations. Additionally, we made progress on incremental growth opportunities including the announcement of the funding framework with the Governments of Canada and Ontario related to the Wataynikaneyap Power Project,\" said Barry Perry, President and Chief Executive Officer, Fortis.\nReported Net Earnings\nThe Corporation reported first quarter net earnings attributable to common equity shareholders of $323 million, or $0.77 per common share, compared to $294 million, or $0.72 per common share, for the same period in 2017.\nIn addition to the tax item noted above, factors affecting net earnings for the period included the following:\nThere was strong performance at UNS Energy, largely due to the impact of a full quarter of new rates at Tucson Electric Power in 2018. ITC continues to perform consistent with expectations, with first quarter 2018 earnings reflecting rate base growth, partially offset by the impact of U.S. tax reform and higher business development costs. The main factors unfavourably impacting earnings per common share for the quarter included: (i) higher number of weighted average shares outstanding in the first quarter 2018; and (ii) unfavourable foreign exchange associated with the translation of U.S. dollar-denominated earnings.\nAdjusted Net Earnings 1\nAdjusting for the one-time $30 million tax remeasurement in 2018 and a $7 million favourable settlement of matters pertaining to FERC-ordered transmission refunds in 2017, first quarter adjusted net earnings attributable to common equity shareholders were $293 million, or $0.69 per common share, compared to $287 million, or $0.71 per common share for the same period in 2017.\nUpdate on Turks and Caicos\nThe Turks and Caicos Islands are quickly returning to normal following the impacts of Hurricane Irma this past fall. Thanks to the strong execution of the Corporation's emergency response team from throughout North America, electricity was restored to customers in less than 60 days. Although revenue was lower than normal at Fortis Turks and Caicos during this post-Irma recovery period, the Corporation expects to recoup most of this revenue under its business interruption insurance during 2018.\n1 Non-US GAAP Measures\nFortis uses financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Fortis calculated the non-US GAAP measures by adjusting certain US GAAP measures for specific items that management believes are not reflective of normal, ongoing operations of the business. Refer to the Financial Highlights section of the Corporation's Management Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these items.\nExecution of growth strategy\nThe Corporation's capital expenditure plan continues to focus on the energy infrastructure needs of customers, while modernizing energy networks to address the changes occurring in the utility industry. Consolidated capital expenditures were $685 million during the first quarter of 2018 and are expected to reach $3.2 billion in 2018. The Corporation's five-year capital expenditure plan from 2018 through 2022 is expected to be approximately $15.1 billion, up $0.6 billion from the previous forecast as a result of the inclusion of the Corporation's share of expected capital investment in the Wataynikaneyap Power Project.\nIn March 2018 the Wataynikaneyap Power Project reached a significant milestone with the formal announcement of a funding framework with the Governments of Canada and Ontario. FortisOntario will be responsible for construction management and operation of the transmission line. The total estimated capital cost for the project is approximately $1.6 billion. The initial phase of the project to connect the Pikangikum First Nation to Ontarioâ€™s power grid is fully funded by the Canadian government and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The next two phases are subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including the leave-to-construct approval from the Ontario Energy Board, anticipated in early 2019. These phases are targeted to be completed by the end of 2020 and 2023, respectively.\nRegulatory proceedings\nFortis is focused on maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and outcomes across its utilities.\nIn April 2018 Central Hudson filed a proposed three-year rate settlement agreement that seeks to establish new rates effective July 1, 2018, reflecting an allowed return on common shareholder's equity of 8.8% on a common equity level of 48% in year one, 49% in year two, and 50% in year three. An order from the New York Public Service Commission is expected in June 2018 with new rates effective as of July 1, 2018.\nOutlook\nOver the long term, Fortis is well positioned to enhance value for shareholders through the execution of its capital expenditure plan, the balance and strength of its diversified portfolio of utility businesses, as well as growth opportunities within its service territories.\nThe Corporation's $15.1 billion five-year capital expenditure plan is expected to increase rate base to $33 billion by 2022, resulting in a five-year compound annual growth rate of 5.4%. The five-year capital expenditure plan is driven by investments that improve and automate the electricity grid, address natural gas system capacity and gas line network integrity, increase cyber protection and allow the grid to deliver cleaner energy.\nFortis is focused on securing further organic growth opportunities at its subsidiaries, which include the ITC Lake Erie Connector Project, gas infrastructure opportunities at FortisBC and renewable energy investments, including storage in Arizona. These additional investment opportunities may be funded through debt raised at the utilities, cash from operations, common equity contributions from the dividend reinvestment plan and at-the-market common equity program.\nFortis expects the long-term sustainable growth in rate base to support continuing growth in earnings and dividends. Fortis has targeted average annual dividend growth of approximately 6% through to 2022. This dividend guidance takes into account many factors, including the expectation of reasonable outcomes for regulatory proceedings at the Corporation's utilities, the successful execution of the five-year capital expenditure plan, and management's continued confidence in the strength of the Corporation's diversified portfolio of utilities and record of operational excellence.\nThis media release should be read in conjunction with the Corporation's Management Discussion and Analysis and Consolidated Financial Statements.
