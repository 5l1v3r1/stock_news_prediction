KPS intends to invest a significant amount of capital in AGG to expand the business through acquisitions in the automotive parts industry globally, leveraging our industry knowledge, manufacturing expertise and relationships on a global basis.\"\nGeorge Thanopoulos said, \"We are very excited to acquire L&W and launch AGG. L&W possesses world-class assets, industry-leading quality and service, and a commitment to investing in state-of-the-art technology and process development. L&W's greatest asset is its customer relationships established over decades. KPS and I look forward to working with L&W's President Scott Jones and the Company's management team to build on the Company's unique strengths with a new strategic vision, financial resources and exceptional credentials in the global automotive industry.\"\nCompletion of the transaction is expected in spring 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.
