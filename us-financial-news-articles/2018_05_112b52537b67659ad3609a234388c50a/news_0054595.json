There were no survivors. Two thirds of those killed were Dutch.\n“The Buk that was used came from the Russian army, the 53rd brigade,” Chief Dutch Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke told Reuters. “We know that was used, but the people in charge of this Buk, we don’t know.”\nRussia repeated on Thursday that it had nothing to do with the incident.\n“Not a single air defence missile launcher of the Russian Armed Forces has ever crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border,” Russia’s TASS news agency quoted the Defence Ministry as saying in a statement.\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry said the findings had been based on fake data presented by bloggers and that Moscow’s information regarding the case had been largely ignored.\n“This is an example of baseless accusations aimed at discrediting our country in the eyes of the international community,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\nInvestigators appealed to the public to come forward and help identify members of the crew who operated the missile and determine how high up the chain of command the order originated.\n“The Russian Federation didn’t help us in providing us the information we brought out into the open today,” Westerbeke said. “They didn’t give us this information, although a Buk from their military forces was used.”\nProsecutors showed photos and videos of a truck convoy carrying the system as it crossed the border from Russia to Ukraine. It crossed back several days later with one missile missing. The vehicles had serial numbers and other markings that were unique to the 53rd Brigade, an anti-aircraft unit based in the western Russian city of Kursk, they said. A damaged missile is displayed during a news conference by members of the Joint Investigation Team, comprising the authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine who present interim results in the ongoing investigation of the 2014 MH17 crash that killed 298 people over eastern Ukraine, in Bunnik, Netherlands, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\nIn the interim update on their investigation, prosecutors said they had trimmed their list of possible suspects from more than a hundred to several dozen.\nWesterbeke said investigators were not yet ready to identify individual suspects publicly or to issue indictments, but that when they do he expects cooperation, or a firm international political response. HOLD RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte cut short a trip to India to return in time for a cabinet meeting on Friday to discuss the latest findings in the inquiry.\nThe MH17 Disaster Foundation representing families of the victims demanded that the Dutch government take legal action to hold the Russian state accountable.\n“It must go beyond legal exploration after this,” board member Piet Ploeg was quoted by the NOS broadcaster as saying.\nA Joint Investigation Team, drawn from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine, is gathering evidence for a criminal prosecution in the downing of the plane.\nUkrainian Army General Vasyl Hrytsak, a member of the investigation team, told Reuters the next crucial step would be to pinpoint who issued the orders to move the missile system.
