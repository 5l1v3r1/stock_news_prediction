I missed so many putts,” Woods told reporters after a round that included 33 putts.\n“But you got to put it behind and move on to the next one and hit the next shot with just as much commitment and I did that all day and unfortunately I didn’t make anything until the last hole.”\nSam Burns, three-under par through 14 holes, was the on-course leader with a five-under total. Four-times major winner Rory McIlroy, who was among the late starters, bogeyed his first hole to drop to two-under on the week.\nThis week marked Woods’ first start since last month’s U.S. Masters, where he arrived as one of the favourites after some encouraging results but ultimately finished in a share of 32nd place.\nThe 14-times major champion did not touch a club for 10 days after that disappointing result at Augusta National and arrived at Quail Hollow, where he triumphed in 2007, with a new set of irons that he hoped would help turn things around.\nMasters champion Patrick Reed mixed an eagle with three birdies and five bogeys for a second consecutive one-under 71 that left him at even par for the week.\nJustin Thomas, who picked up his first major victory in the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow last August, was also at even par after a two-under 69 that included five birdies and three bogeys.
