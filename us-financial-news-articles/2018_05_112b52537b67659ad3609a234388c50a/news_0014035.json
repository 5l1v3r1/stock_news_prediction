Gordon stole second, advanced to third on a bunt by Jean Segura and scored on Robinson Cano’s single to left field.\nGordon led off the third with a bloop double down the right-field line. He went to third on another bunt by Segura and scored when Cano lined a single to center field.\nCruz then hit a 1-0 pitch over the center-field fence, giving Seattle a 4-0 lead. It was Cruz’s seventh home run of the season.\nSeattle left-hander Wade LeBlanc, making his first start since late in the 2016 season, pitched four scoreless innings. LeBlanc allowed three hits, walked one and struck out three.\nThe Athletics scored their only run when Stephen Piscotty led off the fifth by launching a 443-foot homer to left-center field off reliever Chasen Bradford. It was Piscotty’s second home run of the season.\nBradford (3-0) pitched 2 1/3 innings of one-hit relief for the victory. James Pazos recorded the final two outs in the seventh.\nJuan Nicasio struck out the side in the eighth and Edwin Diaz pitched the ninth for his major league-leading 13th save.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:10:23.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
