PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nEcolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL):\nFIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS :\nReported diluted EPS $0.84, -2%. Adjusted diluted EPS $0.91, +14%, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items. Reported sales +10%. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales +6% with solid growth in all segments. Strong sales gains, pricing, new product innovation and cost savings offset higher delivered product costs. Lower taxes and interest expense also benefited the adjusted EPS gain.\n2018 FORECAST :\n2018 adjusted diluted EPS forecast increased to $5.30 to $5.50, +13% to 18%, as improving volume and pricing growth in all segments are expected to more than offset higher delivered product costs to drive the strong earnings gain. The prior forecast was $5.25 to $5.45.\nFirst Quarter Ended March 31 Reported Adjusted * (unaudited) Public Currency Rates % Public Currency Rates % (millions, except per share) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Net sales $3,470.9 $3,162.4 10 % $3,470.9 $3,162.4 10 % Operating income 354.3 357.2 (1 )% 380.3 364.9 4 % Net income attributable to Ecolab 247.3 254.0 (3 )% 266.9 236.4 13 % Diluted earnings per share $0.84 $0.86 (2 )% $0.91 $0.80 14 % Adjusted * Fixed Currency Rates * % Fixed Currency Rates % 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Net sales $3,503.9 $3,290.4 6 % $3,503.9 $3,290.4 6 % Operating income 357.5 369.7 (3 )% 383.5 377.4 2 % * See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of this release for further discussion\nNew business gains, better pricing, product innovation and cost efficiencies offset higher delivered product costs, and along with a lower tax rate and interest expense, yielded a 14% increase in first quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nCEO comment\nCommenting on the quarter, Douglas M. Baker, Jr., Ecolab’s chairman and chief executive officer said, \"We are off to a strong start for the year, as we showed continued good sales momentum in the first quarter across all segments led by new business wins, new products and pricing. These solid sales gains, along with cost efficiencies, offset higher delivered product costs and systems investments, and with a lower tax rate and interest expense, yielded the 14% adjusted earnings per share growth.\n\"We remain confident in our outlook for a strong year in 2018. We continue to expect improved sales and earnings performances in all our business segments to yield double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth through the balance of the year. Business momentum has improved, while headwinds from higher delivered product costs remain significant and will throughout the year. However, we believe they peaked on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter, as did our system investment costs. Our pricing initiatives are expected to accelerate through the balance of the year providing margin expansion in the second half versus 2017. Additionally, we are developing a comprehensive efficiency initiative leveraging our systems investments which will give us another important means of expanding margins.\n\"Our value proposition - the best results at the lowest total cost for our customers - continues to win new business and drive our success, and our increasing investments in digital technology are already strengthening our offering and our competitive advantage. We are positioned well, and are excited about our opportunities, our strengthened capacities and the team we have to achieve them. We expect to once again deliver attractive returns for shareholders this year, as we also build our growth drivers for strong future growth.”\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nBeginning in 2018, Ecolab adopted the new FASB revenue recognition standard. We reviewed our product and service offerings under the new standard and the SEC requirement for separation of them in our income statement. As such, we now disclose product and service offerings separately in our income statement. We also reclassified certain costs, primarily compensation, from selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses to cost of sales (COS), to align with the costs of providing newly classified service revenue. Adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and is expected to have a $0.01 unfavorable impact on full year 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share. We revised the 2016 and 2017 financial information to align with the new presentation, which was disclosed in our 8-K dated April 18, 2018.\nEcolab also adopted the new pension accounting standard beginning in 2018, recording the employee compensation cost of pension expense (the service component) in COS and SG&A, while all other non-service components of pension income are recorded below operating income in other (income)/expense. We adopted the new standard retrospectively and revised the 2016 and 2017 financial information to reflect the adoption of the pension accounting standard in the 8-K mentioned above.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Results\nEcolab's first quarter reported sales increased 10% and fixed currency sales increased 6%. Acquisition and divestiture adjusted fixed currency sales increased 6% when compared to the prior year.\nFirst quarter 2018 reported operating income decreased 1%, fixed currency operating income decreased 3%, and adjusted and acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income both increased 2%. Pricing, volume growth and cost savings initiatives offset the impact of higher delivered product costs and investments in the business during the quarter.\nOther income, which primarily consists of the return on pension assets and other costs of our pension obligations, increased 15% reflecting our expected return on increased pension assets.\nReported net interest expense decreased in the quarter primarily reflecting lower interest rate debt.\nThe reported income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 21.8% compared with the reported rate of 17.4% in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items, the adjusted tax rate was 22.0% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 24.9% for the same period last year. The decrease in our adjusted tax rate was primarily driven by changes in the U.S. tax law.\nFirst quarter 2018 reported net income attributable to Ecolab decreased 3%. Excluding the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items, adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab increased 13%.\nDiluted earnings per share decreased 2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 14% when compared against first quarter 2017. Currency translation had a $0.03 favorable impact on first quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share, and adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had a $0.01 favorable impact on first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nEcolab reacquired 1.6 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Review\nGlobal Industrial (unaudited) First Quarter Ended March 31 Acq.

Other segment acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 8% as Pest Elimination enjoyed strong growth, led by North America and Europe. Acquisition and divestiture adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 14% as pricing and sales volume gains more than offset increased field-related costs. The Equipment Care business was sold on November 1, 2017.\nCorporate\nThe corporate segment expense includes amortization expense of $43 million in both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 related to the Nalco merger intangible assets. Corporate segment operating income also includes net special charges of $26 million ($20 million after tax) primarily related to a previously announced funding commitment to the Ecolab Foundation.\nTotal special gains and charges for the first quarter of 2017 were a net charge of $8 million ($5 million after tax) associated with Anios and Swisher acquisition and integration costs.\nBusiness Outlook\n2018\nEcolab raised its forecast for full year 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share to the $5.30 to $5.50 range, representing a 13% to 18% increase over 2017. The prior forecast range was $5.25 to $5.45.\nWhen compared with our 2017 performance, we expect improved acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all of our segments. Versus the comparable measures last year, we anticipate a higher adjusted gross margin as volume gains, pricing and cost efficiency actions more than offset higher delivered product costs, with a similar SG&A ratio to sales, higher other income, and slightly higher interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate versus 2017 reflecting the impact of the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and tax planning. Adoption of the new revenue recognition standard is expected to have a $0.01 unfavorable impact on full year adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nWe expect special charges in 2018 to be $0.12 to $0.15 per share principally related to a previously announced $25 million funding commitment to the Ecolab Foundation as well as integration of previously announced acquisitions. In addition, the discrete tax item related to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation is expected to be favorable. Other than this discrete tax item and special gains and charges noted above, other such amounts are not currently quantifiable.\nAt current rates of exchange, we expect foreign currency translation to have an approximate $0.10 benefit to diluted earnings per share.\nOur detailed outlook for the full year of 2018 (which reflects adoption of the new accounting standards) is as follows:\nAdjusted Gross Margin, excluding special gains and charges approx. 42% SG&A % of Sales 27% to 28% Other income and expense approx. $80 million Interest expense, net approx. $240 million Adjusted tax rate 21% to 22% Noncontrolling interest approx. $0.07 Adjusted EPS, excluding special gains and charges $5.30 to $5.50 Diluted shares approx. 292 million Reported 2017 diluted earnings per share of $5.12 included special gains and charges and discrete tax items. Excluding these items, 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.68.\n2018 — Second Quarter\nEcolab expects second quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $1.23 to $1.29 range, rising 10% to 15% compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.12 a year ago.\nVersus the comparable measures last year, we expect year-on-year acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all our segments. Volume gains and higher pricing are expected to more than offset higher delivered product costs in the quarter. We expect consolidated gross margins to be similar to last year, with a higher SG&A ratio to sales, higher other income and an improved adjusted tax rate versus 2017 resulting from the new U.S. tax law referenced above and tax planning. Adoption of the new revenue recognition standard is expected to have a $0.01 unfavorable impact on second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nWe expect special charges in the second quarter of 2018 to be $0.04 to $0.07 per share principally related to integration of previously announced acquisitions. In addition, the discrete tax item related to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation is expected to be favorable. Other than this discrete tax item and special gains and charges noted above, other such expected amounts are not currently quantifiable.\nAt current rates of exchange, we expect foreign currency to be favorable $0.04 per share in the second quarter.\nOur detailed outlook for the second quarter of 2018 (which reflects adoption of the new accounting standards) is as follows:\nAdjusted Gross Margin, excluding special gains and charges approx. 42% SG&A % of Sales approx. 28% Other income and expense approx. $20 million Interest expense, net approx. $60 million Adjusted tax rate 20% to 21% Noncontrolling interest approx. $0.02 Adjusted EPS, excluding special gains and charges $1.23 to $1.29 Diluted shares approx. 293 million Reported second quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share of $1.00 included special gains and charges and discrete tax items. Excluding these items, second quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.12.\nAbout Ecolab\nA trusted partner at nearly three million customer locations, Ecolab (ECL) is the global leader in water, hygiene and energy technologies and services that protect people and vital resources.

These statements are based on the current expectations of management of the company. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this communication. In particular, the ultimate results of any restructuring, integration and business improvement actions, including cost synergies, depend on a number of factors, including the development of final plans, the impact of local regulatory requirements regarding employee terminations, the time necessary to develop and implement the restructuring and other business improvement initiatives and the level of success achieved through such actions in improving competitiveness, efficiency and effectiveness.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that may affect operating results and business performance are set forth under Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K, and our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and include the vitality of the markets we serve, including the impact of oil price fluctuations on the markets served by our Global Energy segment; the impact of economic factors such as the worldwide economy, capital flows, interest rates and foreign currency risk, including reduced sales and earnings in other countries resulting from the weakening of local currencies versus the U.S. dollar; our ability to execute key business initiatives, including upgrades to our information technology systems; potential information technology infrastructure failures and cybersecurity attacks; our ability to attract and retain high caliber management talent to lead our business; exposure to global economic, political and legal risks related to our international operations including trade sanctions; our ability to develop competitive advantages through innovation and to commercialize digital solutions; the costs and effects of complying with laws and regulations, including those relating to the environment and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products; difficulty in procuring raw materials or fluctuations in raw material costs; pressure on operations from consolidation of customers, vendors or competitors; the occurrence of litigation or claims, including related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; restraints on pricing flexibility due to contractual obligations; our ability to acquire complementary businesses and to effectively integrate such businesses; changes in tax law and unanticipated tax liabilities; potential loss of deferred tax assets or increase in deferred tax liabilities; our substantial indebtedness; public health epidemics; potential losses arising from the impairment of goodwill or other assets; potential chemical spill or release; potential class action lawsuits; the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor; acts of war or terrorism; natural or man-made disasters; water shortages; severe weather conditions; and other uncertainties or risks reported from time to time in our reports to the SEC.

We caution that undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Ecolab does not undertake, and expressly disclaims, any duty to update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis news release and certain of the accompanying tables include financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures include:\nfixed currency sales acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales adjusted cost of sales adjusted gross margin fixed currency operating income fixed currency operating income margin adjusted operating income adjusted fixed currency operating income adjusted fixed currency operating income margin acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin adjusted tax rate adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab adjusted diluted earnings per share\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\nOur non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted earnings per share further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.\nWe evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange, which eliminate the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international results. Fixed currency amounts included in this release are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2018. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for informational purposes.\nAcquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of any acquired business from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of divested businesses from the previous twelve months prior to divestiture. Acquisition adjusted growth rates also exclude sales to our Venezuelan deconsolidated subsidiaries from both the current period and comparable period of the prior year.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the GAAP measures included in this news release. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures are included in the following \"Supplemental Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" and “Supplemental Diluted Earnings per Share Information” tables included in this news release.\nWe do not provide reconciliations for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including those contained in this report) when we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact reported earnings per share and the reported tax rate, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures to adjusted earnings per share and the adjusted tax rate. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n(ECL-E)\nECOLAB INC.

Special (gains) and charges for 2017 also included restructuring gains of $0.2 million, and charges of $24.5 million, $1.7 million and $6.4 million, net of tax, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. Special (gains) and charges for 2017 also included a gain of $3.3 million, $2.0 million and $1.9 million, net of tax, during the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, related to the recovery of previously written off Venezuelan intercompany receivables. Special (gains) and charges for 2017 also included charges of $14.4 million, net of tax, related to a Global Energy vendor contract termination and litigation charges in the second quarter, litigation charges of $1.4 million, net of tax, in the third quarter, and $3.1 million, net of tax, primarily related to impairment of plant assets, litigation charges and settlement in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter 2017 special (gains) and charges also included a gain on sale of Equipment Care of $12.4 million, net of tax, and the charges on exchanged and extinguished debt of $13.6 million, net of tax, which were partially offset by tax benefits on the repatriation of cash to the U.S. of $7.8 million, net of tax.\n(2) Discrete tax expense (benefits) were primarily driven by $16.0 million, $10.8 million, $2.4 million and $10.4 million of tax benefits associated with stock compensation excess tax benefits in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The remaining $6.8 million discrete tax benefits in the first quarter were driven primarily by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. The second quarter 2017 discrete tax expense of $1.1 million was driven primarily by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. The third quarter 2017 discrete tax expense of $10.7M was driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 U.S. federal income tax return. The fourth quarter discrete tax benefits were driven primarily by $319.0 million benefit for repricing of U.S. deferred tax positions to the U.S. tax reform rate along with the stock compensation excess tax benefits, partially offset by $160.1 million expense for the U.S. tax reform one time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.\n(3) Special (gains) and charges for 2018 primarily includes a commitment to the Ecolab Foundation of $18.9 million, net of tax, along with restructuring activities of $0.3 million, net of tax, acquisition and integration costs and $0.3 million, net of tax, and other litigation charges of $0.3 million, net of tax, in the first quarter.\n(4) Discrete tax expense (benefits) were primarily driven by $6.8 million of tax benefits associated with stock compensation excess tax benefits, the U.S. tax reform one time repatriation tax expense of $11.3 million, and $4.6 million of other tax benefits in the first quarter.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005921/en/\nEcolab Inc.\nMichael J.
