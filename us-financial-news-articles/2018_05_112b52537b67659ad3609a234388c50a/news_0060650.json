The increase in net income can be attributed to management's re-structuring of the Company's assets and continued focus on higher yielding loan products.\nPerformance Highlights:\nTotal assets decreased by $19.4 million, or 5.0%, while net loans increased $15.0 million, or 8.4%, from December 31, 2017; evidencing management's focus on restructuring and re-allocation of funds into higher yielding loan products. The mark to market adjustment associated with the derivative instrument entered into as a part of management's re-structuring and interest rate risk management performed well as among other factors, interest rates increased in the quarter, driving non-interest income. Quarter net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 concluded to be the best quarterly earnings in the history of the Bancorp.\nDave Baker, President and CEO commented, \"We are pleased to report the strongest net income of the Bancorp in a quarter. Our focus on loan and deposit products, while re-structuring the balance sheet has allowed the Company to trend back to its roots as a community bank.\"\nFinancial Performance Overview:\nFirst Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017\nFor the first quarter 2018, net income totaled $424 thousand an increase of $166 thousand, or 64%, as compared to the net income of $258 thousand for first quarter 2017. The increase in net income can be mainly attributed to the increased interest income associated with the loan portfolio growth combined with the decrease in the corporate tax rate associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet Interest Income remained stable with a $32 thousand or 2% decrease, as the bank continues to restructure its assets into higher yielding organic loans and grow the company's organic deposits while continuing to reduce the more volatile brokered deposits.\nTo accommodate for the loan growth, the provision for loan loss increased to $51 thousand for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $12 thousand for the same period in 2017.\nNon-interest income increased $392 thousand, or 2613%, to $377 thousand for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $26 thousand for the same period last year. Much of the increase for the first quarter of 2018 can be attributed to the mark to market gain associated with the derivative instrument, which was entered into during the fourth quarter 2017. The purchase of the interest rate cap was part of the previously mentioned restructuring and interest rate risk management.\nThe Company's non-interest expenses increased $111 thousand, or 8.2%, to $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period last year. This increase was largely due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $148 thousand and increase of Federal Insurance Premium of $41 thousand. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in advertising of $46 thousand along with a decrease in director fees of $47 thousand. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was partially due to the addition of administrative staff to support our growth initiative in new markets, including the opening of our Montville branch in late third quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Condition:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's total assets were $363.3 million, a decrease of $19.4 million, or 5%, as compared to total assets of $382.7 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total assets was driven by the distribution of a portion of the cash and cash equivalents held as of December 31, 2017. The cash was utilized to fund loan growth and better manage deposit expense with a reduction in the interest-bearing deposit accounts.\nNet loans receivable, increased $15.1 million, or 12%, to $195.1 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $180.0 million on December 31, 2017. The increase in loans was primarily in the residential real estate portfolio, while the Company's business variable term loans showed growth of $2.6 million, or 72%.\nThe Company's total deposits decreased $17.3 million, or 6.1%, to $268.5 million as of March 31, 2018, from $285.8 million on December 31, 2017. The decrease in deposits reflected an outflow of interest bearing demand deposit accounts, which allowed for better interest rate risk management.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's total stockholders' equity was $15.6 million, a decrease of $1.4 million when compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease was largely due to an increase of $1.9 million, to $3.8 million, in the company's accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the investment portfolio as of March 31, 2018; compared to an unrealized loss on the portfolio of $1.9 million on December 31, 2017. The Bank will continue to monitor and adjust its position accordingly. As of March 31, 2018, Tier I risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and common equity Tier I capital ratios for the Bank continue to show adequate capitalization of 6.45%, 15.17%, 15.66% and 15.17%, respectively, all in excess of the ratios required to be deemed \"well-capitalized.\"\nAbout Lincoln Park Bancorp\nEstablished in 1923 and headquartered in Lincoln Park, N.J., Lincoln Park Bancorp (OTC Bulletin Board: LPBC) through its wholly owned subsidiary Lincoln 1st Bank operates 2 branch banking locations in Lincoln Park and Montville, New Jersey.
