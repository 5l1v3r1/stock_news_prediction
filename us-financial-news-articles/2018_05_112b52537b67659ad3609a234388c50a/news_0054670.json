REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo\nThe owner of Australian No. 2 supermarket Coles, Kmart and Target said London-based turnaround specialist Hilco will buy its 255-store UK DIY chain. It did not disclose a price, but said the UK exit would bring an up to 230 million pound loss this year.\nAfter paying A$700 million (396 million pounds) for Homebase in 2016 and then launching a $700 million rebranding, Wesfarmers took a $1 billion write off this year, admitting it bungled the takeover with basic errors like failing to stock its stores for the chilly UK winter.\nLike several other Australian companies, Wesfarmers failed to replicate its domestic success in the UK by misjudging that market, and the failed deal raises questions about the company’s new strategy of divesting Coles to pay for higher-growth investments.
