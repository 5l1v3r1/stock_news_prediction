Total investments in the project will exceed 10 billion riyals in the next couple of years,” he added.\nThe second phase will be completed in five years, and the firm would launch the third phase this year, CEO Ziad El Chaar said.\nThis month, Dar Al Arkan announced first quarter net profits of 331.1 million riyals versus 12.1 million a year ago as it implemented a new strategy to diversify income sources.\nShelash said the economic slowdown in the kingdom had caused the company’s margins to fall to about 18 percent over the last two to three years, from 45 percent.\nBut he said the Saudi real estate market would be one of the best sectors to invest in over the next five years as the kingdom’s young population fuels demand.\nThe government wants to increase activity in the real estate market to revitalise the economy. It is taking steps to reform the sector as part of its 2030 strategic plan.
