(NASDAQ: ARLZ) (TSX: ARZ) (\" Aralez \" or the \" Company \") today announced financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018. The Company also highlighted certain recent corporate and commercial updates. All figures are in U.S. dollars.\nRecent Corporate & Commercial Updates\nEarlier today, the Company announced that it has determined that a new strategic direction with a focus on driving organic growth in Canada supported by the ongoing revenue generation from Toprol-XL ® and its Authorized Generic (the \"Toprol-XL Franchise\") and royalties from Vimovo ® is in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. This strategic direction will also involve the discontinuation of the remaining U.S. commercial business. On April 3, 2018, the United States Government (the \"Government\") exercised its second renewal option under the VA National Contract between Aralez Pharmaceuticals US Inc. and the Government (the \"VA Contract\"), extending the term of the VA Contract by one year to April 28, 2019.\n\"Earlier this morning, in addition to reporting a solid first quarter of 2018, which included the Company's third consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA, we announced an important business update related to our continuing evaluation of strategic opportunities to streamline the business and reduce costs,\" said Adrian Adams, Chief Executive Officer of Aralez. \"We have also engaged Moelis & Company LLC to serve as our financial and strategic advisor in this ongoing evaluation of opportunities as well as to immediately evaluate all strategic options going forward.\"\nFinancial Summary\nAralez's financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include the results of Aralez Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (formerly known as Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.), Zontivity ® and the Toprol-XL Franchise for each full period. Revenues for Zontivity were previously recorded in other revenues net of related cost of product revenues and fees paid during the transition service period, which expired on March 31, 2017. Effective March 31, 2017, revenues for Zontivity are recorded in net product revenues. Revenues for the Toprol-XL Franchise were recorded in other revenues net of related cost of product revenues and fees paid during the transition service period, which expired on December 31, 2017. However, certain revenues from sales of the Toprol-XL Authorized Generic (\"Toprol-XL AG\") made under the Distribution and Supply Agreement with Lannett Company, Inc. (the \"Lannett Toprol-XL AG Agreement\") were recorded on a gross basis in net product revenues upon contract execution in November 2017. Beginning in 2018, all revenues for the Toprol-XL Franchise are recorded in net product revenues.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $38.1 million, an increase of $12.1 million, or 47%, compared to $26.0 million for the same period of 2017.\nNet product revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $34.0 million and primarily comprised of revenues from the Toprol-XL Franchise, revenues from the Canadian product portfolio acquired in the acquisition of Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (the \"Tribute Merger\") and revenues from Zontivity and Fibricor ® . Other revenues of $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were primarily comprised of Vimovo royalties. Net product revenues of $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 related to the product portfolio acquired in the Tribute Merger. Other revenues of $19.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 were primarily comprised of net revenues from the Toprol-XL Franchise and Zontivity acquisitions and Vimovo royalties.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $26.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.3 million, compared to $30.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the 2018 period was primarily a result of decreased costs for consulting and professional fees, the impact of the cost savings initiatives announced in April 2017, which included a 32% reduction in the U.S. sales force, and a decrease in share-based compensation. These costs were partially offset by increased costs associated with the discontinuation of Yosprala ® .\nNet loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $19.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $27.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below) in the first quarter of 2018 was $4.9 million compared to ($3.7) million in the first quarter of 2017. This was the Company's third consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, approximately 67 million of the Company's common shares were issued and outstanding and the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $43.9 million. During the first quarter, the increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven primarily by a significant working capital adjustment which the Company believes will reverse itself over time. Based on recent events, the Company has determined that there is a reasonable possibility that the Company will not have sufficient liquidity to fund its current and planned operations through the next 12 months, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Guidance\nIn light of the new strategic direction of the Company, very recent increased generic competition with respect to the Toprol-XL Franchise and the uncertain timing and structure of the Company's potential asset divestitures, the Company is withdrawing its previous guidance and intends to issue revised guidance once it fully assesses the impact of these changes.\nFirst Quarter Results Webcast\nAralez will host a webcast this morning, May 8, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET to present first quarter 2018 results and recent business updates. The webcast can be accessed live and will be available for replay at www.aralez.com .\nConference Call Details\nDate: Tuesday, May 8, 2018\nTime: 8:00 a.m. ET\nDial-in (U.S.): 877-407-8037\nDial-in (International): 201-689-8037\nAbout Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nAralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARLZ) (TSX: ARZ) is a leading Canadian specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering meaningful products to improve patients' lives while creating shareholder value by acquiring, developing and commercializing products in various specialty areas. Aralez's Global Headquarters is in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada and the Irish Headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland. More information about Aralez can be found at www.aralez.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP).\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Company is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense and financing costs, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, gains or losses related to the fair value of warrants, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, restructuring costs, retention and severance costs, impact of an acquisition of a business or product, transaction costs related to (i) acquisitions (ii) business development opportunities (iii) debt refinancing options and other financing costs and (iv) certain agreement termination costs, acquired in-process R&D, tax equalization payments, interest income, the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, asset impairment charges, losses or gains on sale of assets, losses or gains on extinguishment or modification of debt and the impact of a sale or disposition of a business or product, including discontinued operations.\nManagement believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency regarding the Company's operating performance by excluding (i) non-cash expenses that are substantially dependent on changes in the market price of the Company's common shares, and (ii) discrete items, such as merger and acquisition costs, transaction costs related to acquisitions, business development opportunities, debt refinancing options and other financing costs, certain contract termination costs, restructuring costs and severance and retention expenses, that may not be consistently recurring. Management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational results and to make financial and operational decisions. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the Company's operating results as reported under GAAP, not as a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

Accordingly, actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.\nIn addition, the Company's operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the Company's control, and any one or any combination of these risks and uncertainties could also affect whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct and could cause the Company's actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

You should not place undue importance on forward-looking statements and should not rely upon this information as of any other date. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.\nAralez Pharmaceuticals US Inc.
