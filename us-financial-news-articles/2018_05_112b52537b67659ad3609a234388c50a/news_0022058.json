It’s just not acceptable that we can live as animals here, please take us home as quickly as possible.”\nThe facility now holds 470, he said.\n“Taking them back home isn’t the problem. The problem is getting the coalition, Saudi Arabia giving us permission for ‘deconfliction’ to have IOM buses travel from Sanaa to Hodeidah,” he said, referring to advance security guarantees.\nAbdiker, noting that it was a five-hour bus ride, added: “For that I need to get permission from the Saudis to ‘deconflict’ the convoy - meaning they will not bomb that convoy that IOM is putting in place.\n“Then I need also the Saudis to give me ‘deconfliction’ for IOM boats to go to Hodeidah port, pick up the migrants and take them to Djibouti.\n“We should expect the clearance in the next two to three days for IOM to start the initial operation of moving the first 458 migrants, the majority Ethiopians,” he said.
