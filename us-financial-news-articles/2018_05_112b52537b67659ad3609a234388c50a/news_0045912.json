Great news for EU citizens,\" Tajani said.\nThe development comes after EU parliamentarians raised concerns over the fact that the meeting was going to be held behind closed doors.\n\"We're looking forward to the meeting and happy for it to be livestreamed,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.\nTalk of regulation for tech firms like Facebook has increased since reports first surfaced earlier this year claiming Facebook allowed the data of tens of millions to be harvested by controversial data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.\nFacebook has said that 87 million users may have had their data improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica briefly worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, but it maintains that data was not used during the vote.
