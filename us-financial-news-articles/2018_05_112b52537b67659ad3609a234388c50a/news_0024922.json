We believe that this is a breakthrough and should not go unnoticed. Additionally, we believe that our completion of a multi-unit enclosed ground flares project has created an entirely new vertical for the industry and we believe that ClearSign is ideally positioned to dominate it.\"\nStrategic and operational highlights during and subsequent to the first-quarter included:\nSuccessfully Completed a Follow-On Project for a Once Thru Steam Generator (OTSG) system on a complex Waste Gas Application – The retrofitted unit achieved initial field testing results with average NOx emissions of 2.2 ppm, significantly below the current regulatory standard of 5 ppm. Completed the Company's First Enclosed Ground Flare Project – ClearSign announced the completion, customer acceptance and issuance of payment for the final phase of a multiphase $1.1 million project. This project successfully retrofitted Duplex™ technology into enclosed ground flares for a major California oil producer. The Company believes this will be a meaningful new vertical for its technology. Continued Progress With Super Major: ClearSign continues to work closely with Exxon in a development and deployment of our Duplex technology. After the previously announced success of the joint testing at ClearSign's headquarters in Seattle, we have moved to regular ongoing technical meetings to discuss further deployment of our technology at one location within ExxonMobil's US refinery and petrochemical operations. Progress and Expansion of Opportunities in China: ClearSign is working with a large state-owned enterprise (SOE) to install and demonstrate ClearSign's innovative Duplex™ technology in one of its boilers. The Company continues to work with the customer on multiple options to demonstrate the Duplex technology and satisfy the testing requirements as soon as practical. Additionally, the Company engaged in advanced discussions with additional customers in China in the refinery and petrochemical industries. Closed $12.94 M public offering of common stock – We announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2.25 per share. Appointed Susanne Meline to the Board Of Directors – In accordance with the Company's bylaws, ClearSign increased the number of directors from four to five and appointed Ms. Meline to fill the vacancy. Ms. Meline accepted the position on February 9, 2018.\nRevenues from our Duplex technology in the first quarter of 2018 were $530,000 compared to revenues of $360,000 in the same quarter of 2017. These were the results of delivering retrofits in the flare, refinery, and enhanced oil recovery segments. The net loss for the first quarter was $2.3 million compared to $2.4 million a year ago primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative costs.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $11.2 million as of March 31, 2018, with no long-term debt outstanding.\nOn February 27, 2018, we received approximately $11.9 million in net cash proceeds from the closing of the offering of our common stock.\nShares outstanding at March 31, 2018 total 23,361,353.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call to Occur on May 23, 2018\nClearSign invites you to a conference call discussing the Company's First Quarter on Wednesday, May 23, 2018 at 4:30 PM Eastern Time .
