The change in offering price reflects the updated NAV per share.\nIf SIC continues to experience underlying portfolio fluctuations, the Board may further increase or decrease the per share offering price of its shares of common stock for its future weekly closings, pursuant to SIC’s pricing policy included in its prospectus which requires a price update if NAV per share fluctuates more than 2.5% from net offering price per share. SIC has not yet determined that a further adjustment to the newly-established offering price of $8.00 per share will be necessary. In the event SIC determines to adjust its public offering price, a separate announcement will be issued.\nAbout Sierra Income Corporation\nSierra is a non-traded business development company that invests primarily in first lien senior secured debt, second lien secured debt and, to a lesser extent, subordinated debt of middle market companies in a broad range of industries with annual revenue between $50 million and $1 billion.
