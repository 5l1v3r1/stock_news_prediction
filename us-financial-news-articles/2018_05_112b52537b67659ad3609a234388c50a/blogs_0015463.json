I see a bullish scenario unfolding from here, with a target price of 121.\nThe Federal Reserve's message was relatively dovish on Wednesday, more or less signaling they're willing to allow inflation to run hot and above its 2 percent target. I view this as bullish for the futures contract.\nConsider, too, that traders have amassed a record net short position in the 10-year futures, with over 1 million shorts, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Every rally starts with a short cover.\nUltimately, I feel the downside risk is limited. If everyone has already sold here, who is left to sell? If wage growth on Friday's employment report falls short of expectations, I expect the short-covering to begin.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
