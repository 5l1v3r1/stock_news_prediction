Trading volumes were again subdued, with less than 3,000 lots changing hands by 0830 GMT, after Thursday's session was marked by trade selling and bearish options activity. However, broker Marex Spectron said in a note it estimates that long positions on aluminium are \"rebuilding from the recent low\" of 2.4 percent of open interest - an indicator of market liquidity - to 5.4 percent this week. Available LME aluminium stocks are at their lowest level since 2007 after the exchange said it would stop accepting Rusal metal from April 17, although it is now reassessing the situation after the United States gave customers of the Russian producer more time to comply with sanctions. FUNDAMENTALS * LME ALUMINIUM: Three-month aluminium on the LME was down by 1.7 percent to $2,290 a tonne by 0837 GMT, having fallen by as much as 2 percent earlier in the session and slipping by 1.3 percent on Thursday. * ALUMINIUM: The metal is down 2.6 percent in London so far this week but is still up by around 14.1 percent since April 5, the day before the United States imposed sanctions on Russian producer Rusal. * TECHNICALS: LME aluminium is expected to fall to $2,254 per tonne, as it has ended a bounce around a resistance at $2,382, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao says. * RUSAL: Rusal boosted first-quarter recurring net profit on Friday amid stronger aluminium prices, but warned that sanctions imposed by the United States in April could harm its business. * EGA: Emirates Global Aluminium's stock market listing is likely to slip to 2019 because of turmoil in global aluminium markets after the United States imposed sanctions on Rusal, three sources familiar with the deal said. * COPPER: LME copper edged up 0.3 percent and is on course for a 1.6 percent gain this week. The most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed up 0.7 percent at 51,440 yuan ($8,122.92) a tonne.
