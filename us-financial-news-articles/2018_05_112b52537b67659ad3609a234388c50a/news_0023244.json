FUNDAMENTALS * LME ALUMINIUM: Three-month aluminium on the LME was down by 1 percent to $2,312 a tonne by 0217 GMT, having closed down 1.3 percent in the previous session. * ALUMINIUM: The metal is down 1.6 percent in London so far this week but is still up 15.1 percent since April 5, the day before the United States imposed sanctions on Russian producer Rusal. * RUSAL: Rusal boosted first-quarter recurring net profit on Friday amid stronger aluminium prices, but warned that sanctions imposed by the United States in April could harm its business. * EGA: Emirates Global Aluminium's stock market listing is likely to slip to 2019 because of turmoil in global aluminium markets after the United States imposed sanctions on Rusal, three sources familiar with the deal said. * COPPER: LME copper edged down 0.1 percent, having jumped by 1.6 percent on Thursday as inventories continued to fall, and remains on course for a 1.2 percent gain this week. The most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed 0.7 percent to 51,470 yuan ($8,113) a tonne.
