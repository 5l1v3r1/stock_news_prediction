Global demand for platelet kits continued to be robust with first quarter platelet kit sales volumes more than doubling compared to the prior year, led by increased shipments in France and in the U.S.,” said William ‘Obi’ Greenman, Cerus’ president and chief executive officer. “Given the strong first quarter results and the current visibility into our commercial pipeline, we are raising our full year product revenue guidance range to $53 million to $55 million compared to our previous range of $51 million to $53 million.”\n“We continue to push forward with our mission to establish INTERCEPT as the global standard of care for transfused blood components,” continued Greenman. “In the U.S., blood centers are continuing to increase production of INTERCEPT platelets to meet the ever growing hospital demand for pathogen-reduced platelets. In France, we gained additional regulatory approvals on our dual storage processing set for INTERCEPT platelets and shelf-life extension from five to seven days which should allow for increased blood center operational efficiencies and lower product wastage.”\nDuring the quarter, the Company’s development programs continued to progress with the Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) lot release assay achieving validation to support its anticipated CE Mark submission for INTERCEPT red cells, and the INTERCEPT cryoprecipitate program advancing the required stability studies for its planned premarket approval (PMA) supplement submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nRevenue\nProduct revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $13.6 million, compared to $7.0 million during the same period in 2017. The increase in product revenue was driven by quarter-over-quarter increases in platelet kit demand, partially offset by declines in plasma kits and illuminator sales. Reported product revenue in the quarter also benefitted from favorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nGovernment contract revenue from the Company’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) agreement was $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.4 million during the same period in 2017 as a result of increasing INTERCEPT red cell clinical and development activities. BARDA is part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nGross Margins\nGross margins on product revenue for the first quarter of 2018 were 46%, compared to 47% for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margins on product sales remained relatively stable due to a variety of factors including economies of scale and lower costs due to increased platelet production, pricing for high volume customers, and foreign exchange rates.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses were $23.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $22.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 remained relatively flat at $13.6 million, compared to $13.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 as the Company continued to leverage its existing commercial and back-office infrastructure.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $9.4 million compared to $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Expenses associated with the clinical development of the Company’s INTERCEPT red blood cell program increased while non-BARDA related R&D expenses declined as the Company re-allocated R&D personnel to the BARDA activities.\nOperating and Net Loss\nOperating losses during the first quarter of 2018 were $13.4 million, compared to $18.1 million during the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $13.9 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $18.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $105.9 million compared to $60.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $29.8 million in outstanding debt under its loan agreement with Oxford Finance. The loan agreement provides for an additional $10 million term loan (and, if drawn, an extension of the interest only period) upon the Company achieving pre-determined revenue levels. The Company achieved the pre-determined revenue levels as of March 31, 2018, but has not currently exercised its option on the additional $10 million term loan and interest only extension. The option expires on May 14, 2018.\nQUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time today to discuss its financial results and provide a general business overview and outlook.

risks associated with the uncertain nature of BARDA’s funding over which Cerus has no control as well as actions of Congress and governmental agencies which may adversely affect the availability of funding under Cerus’ BARDA agreement and/or BARDA’s exercise of any potential subsequent option periods, such that the anticipated activities that Cerus expects to conduct with the funds available from BARDA may be delayed or halted; risks related to adverse market and economic conditions, including continued or more severe adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and/or weakening economic conditions in the markets where Cerus sells its products; Cerus’ reliance on third parties to market, sell, distribute and maintain its products; Cerus’ ability to maintain an effective manufacturing supply chain, including the ability of its manufacturers to comply with extensive FDA and foreign regulatory agency requirements, and Cerus’ ability to maintain its primary kit manufacturing agreement and its other supply agreements with its third party suppliers; the impact of legislative or regulatory healthcare reforms that may make it more difficult and costly for Cerus to produce, market and distribute its products; risks related to future opportunities and plans, including the uncertainty of Cerus’ future capital requirements and its future revenues and other financial performance and results, as well as other risks detailed in Cerus’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Cerus’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2018. Cerus disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\nCERUS CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share information)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Product revenue $ 13,564 $ 7,006 Cost of product revenue 7,330 3,694 Gross profit on product revenue 6,234 3,312 Government contract revenue 3,455 1,428 Operating expenses: Research and development 9,437 9,150 Selling, general and administrative 13,607 13,683 Total operating expenses 23,044 22,833 Loss from operations (13,355 ) (18,093 ) Non-operating expense, net (476 ) (470 ) Loss before income taxes (13,831 ) (18,563 ) Provision for income taxes 54 35 Net loss $ (13,885 ) $ (18,598 ) Net loss per share: Basic $ (0.11 ) $ (0.18 ) Diluted $ (0.11 ) $ (0.18 ) Weighted average shares outstanding used for calculating net loss per share: Basic 124,814 103,564 Diluted 124,814 103,564 CERUS CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 14,877 $ 13,683 Short-term investments 90,988 47,013 Accounts receivable 10,489 12,415 Inventories 13,165 14,457 Other current assets 4,257 2,330 Total current assets 133,776 89,898 Non-current assets: Property and equipment, net 1,969 2,119 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 1,802 1,852 Restricted cash and other assets 6,874 4,375 Total assets $ 144,421 $ 98,244 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 21,588 $ 22,686 Debt - current 1,429 - Deferred product revenue - current 639 445 Total current liabilities 23,656 23,131 Non-current liabilities: Debt - non-current 28,387 29,798 Manufacturing and development obligations - non-current 5,996 5,766 Other non-current liabilities 784 609 Total liabilities 58,823 59,304 Stockholders' equity 85,598 38,940 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 144,421 $ 98,244\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006408/en/\nCerus Corporation\nTim Lee, 925-288-6137\nInvestor Relations Director\nSource: Cerus Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.cerus.com/ir", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cerus.com%2Fir&esheet=51802988&newsitemid=20180508006408&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cerus.com%2Fir&index=1&md5=9cd1355084391f0798788f04e6c97ba2", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006408/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cerus.com&esheet=51802988&newsitemid=20180508006408&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cerus.com&index=2&md5=c8a388c2f315607a92a775a35b7ffa55"], "published": "2018-05-09T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T23:48:52.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
