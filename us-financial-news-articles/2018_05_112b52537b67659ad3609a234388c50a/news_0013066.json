(NASDAQ:IVTY), a leading medical technology company focused on minimal access surgery, today announces financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue grew 5.3% to $9.5 million compared to revenue of $9.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Disposable revenue in the first quarter of 2018 grew 21.7% to $8.6 million compared to $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The number of accounts buying PhotonBlade® increased 23% from the fourth quarter of 2017 indicating continued strong adoption\n“In the first quarter we made progress towards our near and long term goals. During the quarter, we completed an equity offering, adding $21.7 million of cash and strengthening our balance sheet. In addition, this month we have taken steps to reduce our operating expenses by implementing a restructuring designed to streamline the company and increase productivity in our commercial operations and our product development process.” said Interim Chief Executive Officer Scott Flora. “PhotonBlade continues to be an outstanding product. We saw a 23% increase in accounts ordering PhotonBlade during the quarter demonstrating continued adoption in the market. While there is still work to be done to create a balanced approach to selling our entire disposable product portfolio, I am excited by the opportunity we have in front of us and confident we can demonstrably expand the Invuity franchise.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue was $9.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 5.3% from revenue of $9.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 driven primarily by strong market acceptance of PhotonBlade.\nDisposable revenue was $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 21.7% from revenue of $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Disposable revenue comes from the sale of single use devices; waveguides that are attached to retractors, illuminated aspirators – both Yankauer and Frazier designs – and most recently the addition of PhotonBlade. These revenues are driven by per procedure adoption and represent the primary driver of the Company’s growth.\nGross margin for the first quarter was 69.3% compared to 76.7% for the same period in 2017. The consolidated gross margin was primarily impacted on a comparative basis by the increase in sales of PhotonBlade, which currently has a lower gross margin than other disposable products. Progress continues to be made on cost reduction programs to improve PhotonBlade margins.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $17.0 million, including $3.0 million in severance and litigation expenses, compared to $17.3 million, including $1.4 million in severance and litigation expenses, in the prior year period.\nThe net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.2 million, or $0.62 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $13.2 million, or $0.78 loss per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company's balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 included total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $32.6 million.\nCorporate Restructuring\nIn May the Company implemented a corporate restructuring to streamline the business and increase productivity in the Company’s commercial operations and product development process. It is anticipated this restructuring will reduce operating expenses by approximately $6 million on an annualized basis.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2018 Invuity continues to expect revenue to exceed $46 million and disposable revenue to grow in excess of 25%.\nConference Call\nInvuity's management will discuss the Company's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provide a general business update during a conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, May 3, 2018.
