Financials and technology rose, while the mining and oil sectors fell 1.41 percent and 1.33 percent, respectively.\nAcross the Korean Strait, the benchmark Kospi slipped 0.47 percent to close at 2,449.81.\nStrength in the technology sector stateside carried over to the Asian trading day, buoying the broader index, with heavyweight Samsung Electronics rising 1.35 percent and chipmaker SK Hynix climbing 0.6 percent.\nSymbol Name Price Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Over in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index advanced 1.4 percent by 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN amid broad-based gains. The technology and heavily weighted financials sectors were among the best-performing before the market close, with Tencent last higher by 3.16 percent at 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN.\nMainland markets also saw convincing gains, with the Shanghai composite closing higher by 0.8 percent at 3,161.60 and the Shenzhen composite edging up by 0.77 percent to 1,836.22.\nElsewhere, the S&P/ASX 200 added 0.12 percent to finish the day at 6,091.90, as the 0.82 percent gain in the financials sector supported the index's overall gains despite declines in energy and materials.\nIran nuclear deal in focus Oil prices declined on Tuesday following President Donald Trump's Monday tweet that he would announce his decision on the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures declined 0.75 percent to trade at $70.20 per barrel, after earlier falling below the $70 level that it surpassed on Monday for the first time since end-2014. Brent crude futures, meanwhile, lost 0.64 percent to trade at $75.68.\nThe fall in prices was akin to buy the rumor, \"sell the news kind of behavior\" for markets, which had initially expected a statement from Trump only later in the week, Nicolas Sopel, a strategist at RHB Research Institute Singapore, told CNBC's \"Street Signs.\"\nTrump, who had been due to make a decision by May 12 on the agreement, has criticized the deal, taking issue with so-called \"sunset clauses.\" The 2015 accord has seen international sanctions on Iran lifted in exchange for the country curbing its nuclear program.\nOil had initially settled higher on Monday as markets weighed the potential impact of renewed U.S. sanctions.\n\"There's much to play here. We'd reckon there's still several dollars in the price based on a presumption the U.S. will pull out. So if Trump says he's staying, we could swiftly see another $2 to $3 off crude prices,\" Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank, said in a morning note.\nGains in the region tracked the firmer close on Wall Street on Monday, with technology shares recording a third consecutive day of gains. Still, U.S. stocks finished the day off their intraday highs on the back of Trump's tweet.\nIn currencies, the dollar index , which tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies, were steady at 92.705 at 2:50 p.m. HK/SIN after rising as high as 92.974 on Monday — its strongest level since December. Against the yen , the greenback slipped to trade at 108.90.\nThe Australian dollar , which dipped below $0.75 in the morning on the back of weak retail sales data, recovered slightly to trade at $0.7513.\nOn the economic front, investors digested China April trade data , which topped expectations. China reported imports rose 21.5 percent on year and exports increased by 12.9 percent. Both of those figures beat Reuters forecasts of 16 percent import growth and 6.3 percent export growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:24:01.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
