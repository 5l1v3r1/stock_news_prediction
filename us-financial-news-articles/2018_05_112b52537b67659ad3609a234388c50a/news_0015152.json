He was due to meet Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton, although not the president himself.\nJohnson said he saw no advantage in losing the “handcuffs” the deal imposed on Iran’s nuclear ambitions and only Tehran would benefit from exiting the deal.

Headquarters in New York, U.S., September 18, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also have lobbied Trump not to withdraw from the deal the U.S. president has described as insane, with Macron warning it could lead to war.\n“At this delicate juncture, it would be a mistake to walk away from the nuclear agreement and remove the restraints that it places on Iran,” Johnson wrote.\n“I believe that keeping the deal’s constraints on Iran’s nuclear programme will also help counter Tehran’s aggressive regional behaviour. I am sure of one thing: every available alternative is worse. The wisest course would be to improve the handcuffs rather than break them.”\nIn an interview with Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends,” a television programme that Trump has regularly touted, Johnson said a regional arms race could be spurred if the nuclear deal was to end and Iran was to become a nuclear power.

There doesn’t seem to me at the moment to be a viable military solution.” Reporting by Michael Holden; Additional reporting by Makini Brice in Washington; Editing by William Maclean and Bill Trott", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:16:57.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
