Officials initially said it was caused by a bomb packed into a minibus but later said the explosives were in two containers stored in an area of mechanics workshops.\nNematullah Barak, a head of the Mirwais hospital in Kandahar, said 16 dead and 38 wounded, including several children, had been brought in but the final total could be higher as ambulances were still at the scene.\nThe NDS intelligence service said in a statement the explosives were discovered in a large open yard of workshops but went off before they could be defused.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility.\nWitnesses said repair crews were at the site, clearing large quantities of rubble and debris from the explosion.\nThe casualties add to the hundreds of people who have been killed or wounded in bomb attacks since the beginning of the year.\nMany have been in the capital, Kabul, but provincial cities have also been hit as the Taliban, seeking to reimpose hardline Islamic rule, have stepped up fighting across the country.

AZEEM ZMARIAL/via REUTERS\nKandahar province, on the border with Pakistan, is a major centre of opium cultivation and a stronghold of the Taliban but the city has recently been relatively secure.\nTuesdayâ€™s explosion came as the Taliban pushed ahead with their spring offensive, launched last month, with fighting in several areas of the country.\nAs many as seven police were killed in clashes on Monday night between security forces and the Taliban in Ghazni province, southwest of Kabul, where the insurgents have cut a highway with the neighbouring province of Paktika, officials said.\nArif Noori, spokesman for the provincial governor, said a large Taliban force attacked government positions in five districts of the province late on Monday, with fighting continuing until dawn.\nInsurgents burned down the police headquarters in Jaghato district, he said.\nThe latest fighting coincided with a U.S. government report that found few signs of progress this year, with fighting spreading and hundreds of casualties from militant attacks.
