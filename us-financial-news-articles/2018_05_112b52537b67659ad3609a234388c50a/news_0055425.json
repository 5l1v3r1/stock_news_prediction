MSCI's Asian stocks outside Japan were down 0.8 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not pleased with recent trade talks with Beijing. \"The on-and-off status of U.S.-China trade talks is affecting sentiment. At some point, traders may just decide to stay on the sidelines,\" said Liu Jinshu, director of research, NRA Capital. Malaysian shares plunged 2.21 percent to their lowest close since early January over worries about the size of debt its previous government had left behind. Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Tuesday that the previous government deceived the public and parliament over the country's financial situation and state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. This came amid worries that the new government's populist promises could undermine the country's economic prospects at an increasingly challenging time. Foreign stock inflows for 2018 have been wiped out, with the market posting net outflows of $21.2 million as of May 21, according to data from OCBC Bank. Telecom company Axiata Group slumped 12.6 percent on weak quarterly earnings, while CIMB Group Holdings fell 6.5 percent. Singapore shares fell 1.3 percent to their lowest close in more than five weeks. Index heavyweight Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp declined 1.8 percent, while DBS Group dropped 1.5 percent. Banking stocks traded lower as they are likely to have some exposure to Hyflux Ltd's debt, said Liu Jinshu. Water treatment company Hyflux said on Tuesday it filed for reorganisation of its business after lower electricity prices hurt its finances. The city-state's headline consumer price index rose lower than expected in April from a year earlier. Philippine shares erased early gains to end 1.1 percent lower, extending falls into a sixth session. Property operator SM Investments Corp closed 3.5 percent lower.
