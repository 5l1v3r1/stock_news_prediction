NLB has subsidiaries in Serbia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro.\nSlovenia has agreed to sell a majority of NLB in exchange for the European Commission’s approval of state aid to the bank in 2013.\nSelling the bank will be one of the first tasks of the new government which will be formed after June 3 general election. $1 = 0.8530 euros Reporting by Marja Novak; Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:37:11.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
