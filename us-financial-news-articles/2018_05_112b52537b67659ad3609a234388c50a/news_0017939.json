He didn’t walk a batter.\nAaron Altherr, Jorge Alfaro and Carlos Santana each ripped a solo home run for the Phillies, who have won the first two games in this four-game series. The Phillies blasted four homers in their 11-0 win over the Giants on Monday.\nOdubel Herrera had a pair of hits for the Phillies.\nTommy Hunter got the last out in the eighth and the first out in the ninth. Hector Neris then recorded the final two outs to earn his seventh save of the season.\nGiants left-hander Derek Holland (1-4) was effective at times in giving up six hits and three runs in five innings.\nBrandon Belt had two hits for the Giants, reaching base safely for the 20th consecutive game.\nPablo Sandoval homered for San Francisco.\nAltherr homered in the second, Alfaro in the third and Santana in the sixth. It was the second straight night that Santana connected for a long ball.\nBrandon Crawford gave the Giants a 1-0 advantage in the second with an RBI groundout, scoring Belt.\nThe Phillies responded with four unanswered runs, including an RBI single to center by Herrera in the third. Herrera has reached base safely in a career-best 37 consecutive games.\nThe Giants’ defense, which was shaky Monday with an uncharacteristic three errors, was much better Tuesday. In the seventh, San Francisco turned a double play for a National League-leading 42nd time this season.\nSan Francisco got within 4-2 in the eighth when Sandoval blasted a towering pinch-hit homer to center off Edubray Ramos.\nIn the bottom of the eighth, Scott Kingery appeared to hit an RBI infield single to shortstop. However, after a review by the umpires, the call was reversed, Kingery was called out, and the Phillies’ lead remained 4-2.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:44:35.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
