An out later, Kyle Seager doubled to right-center field to score Cano and tie it. Healy then greeted Eduardo Paredes, the eighth Angels pitcher, with a liner down the left field line to score Seager.\nThe Angels took the lead in the 11th on Andrelton Simmons’ two-out, infield single, his fourth hit of the night, off Mariners right-hander Erik Goeddel (1-0).\nBoth teams scored in the 10th.\nThe Angels’ Chris Young singled in the go-ahead run with two outs in the top of the inning.\nThe Mariners tied it as pinch hitter Ben Gamel led off with a single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on first baseman Jefry Marte’s throwing error on Jean Segura’s infield single.\nThe Angels, who dropped to 12-3 on the road, blew a four-run lead before rallying in the ninth to tie it on Justin Upton’s two-out, two-run homer off Mariners closer Edwin Diaz, who failed to convert a save for the first time in 14 opportunities this season.\nTrailing 4-0, Seattle scored twice in the sixth off Angels starter Tyler Skaggs and added four runs in the eighth off a trio of relievers. Mike Zunino’s two-run homer, his fourth of the season, gave the Mariners their first lead.\nHowever, the Angels responded with two outs in the ninth. Mike Trout hit a ground-rule double down the left field line, and Upton hammered a 2-2 pitch over the center field fence to tie it. It was Upton’s sixth homer.\nSkaggs seemed headed for his fourth straight road victory, cruising through the first five innings.\nHowever, he ran into trouble in the sixth. Segura lined a single to center and moved to third on Mitch Haniger’s double to right-center. Cano then lined a two-run double to center to cut the lead in half.\nThe Mariners pulled ahead in the eighth. Nelson Cruz led off with a single off reliever Jose Alvarez and advanced to second on a groundout. Right-hander Justin Anderson, who hadn’t allowed a run all season, came on to replaced Alvarez. Healy greeted him with single to score Cruz, cutting the deficit to 4-3.\nZunino then hit a towering fly ball to left field that just cleared the fence, giving Seattle a 5-4 lead. After a walk to Guillermo Heredia, Blake Parker replaced Anderson. Andrew Romine doubled off the right field wall, his first hit of the season, to move Heredia to third. Heredia scored on a wild pitch.\nMarte went 3-for-5 with a double and a three-run homer in the sixth off Seattle starter Marco Gonzales. It was his second long ball of the season.\nGonzales went six innings, giving up four runs on nine hits with one walk and seven strikeouts. Skaggs allowed two runs on six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He also had one walk and seven strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-06T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:49:45.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
