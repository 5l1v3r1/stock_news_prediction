Evacuation could come at any time.”\nKilaueax has opened 12 volcanic vents since it started sending out fountains and rivers of lava on Thursday, officials said. Lava was not flowing from any of the vents on Monday.\nResident Heide Austin said she left her home just west of the current eruption zone after noticing small cracks appearing at the end of her driveway.\nOne eruption near her home “sounded like a huge blowtorch going off,” said the 77-year-old who lives alone. “That’s when I really got into a frenzy.”\nMany of the evacuated people were permitted to return home during daylight hours on Sunday and Monday, during a lull in seismic activity.\nResidents of a second area, Lanipuna Gardens, were barred from returning home on Monday due to deadly volcanic gases.\nLeilani Estates, about 12 miles (19 km) from the volcano, was evacuated due to the risk of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be life threatening at high levels.\nNo deaths or major injuries have been reported. At least 35 structures had been destroyed, many of them homes, officials said.\nThe southeast corner of the island was rocked by a powerful magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the volcano’s south flank on Friday. More earthquakes and eruptions have been forecast.\nKilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, has been in constant eruption for 35 years.\nReporting by Terray Sylvester Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:52:21.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
