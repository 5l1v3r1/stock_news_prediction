CBS had sought the temporary restraining order because the directors feared Redstone would replace the board before the meeting.\nCBS shares fell around 6 percent after the ruling amid investor concerns that Redstone would replace CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves and the board.\nOn Wednesday, Redstone used her control to amend CBS’s bylaws to require a supermajority of directors to approve the issuance of a special dividend, essentially allowing her to block the move.\nCBS plans to challenge her bylaw change in court, sources told Reuters on Thursday.\nThe judge, Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware’s Court of Chancery, noted that while he was not convinced the situation required him to restrain Shari Redstone, he had “extensive power” should she breach her fiduciary obligations. Those powers include setting aside Wednesday’s bylaw change if CBS can show they are invalid or unfair, he said in his ruling.\nCBS said in a statement that “the ruling clearly recognises that we may bring further legal action to challenge any actions by NAI that we consider to be unlawful.” FILE PHOTO - Shari Redstone arrives for Variety's Power of Women luncheon in New York City, U.S., April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nThe Redstone family controls both CBS and Viacom through a movie theatre company National Amusements Inc (NAI). NAI welcomed the ruling, and said CBS’s special committee had breached its fiduciary obligations to CBS shareholders.\n“The court’s ruling today represents a vindication of National Amusements’ right to protect its interests,” the company said in a statement.\nThe fast-moving battle for control of the CBS boardroom was put in motion on Sunday, when CBS’s special committee determined the merger with Viacom long-favoured by Shari Redstone was not in the interest of CBS shareholders.\nNational Amusements believes a deal is needed for the two media companies to gain scale and compete with the likes of video-streaming company Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ).\nBouchard said he expected to continue to have oversight of the actions by CBS and Redstone.\nShares of CBS were down 4.2 percent by midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange at $51.60 (£38.2) while shares of Viacom were up 0.5 percent at $28.40 on Nasdaq.
