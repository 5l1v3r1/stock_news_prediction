Reuters was not immediately able to reach him for comment.\nCasucci said in the complaint that she reported the assault to the company’s diversity and inclusiveness officer in 2016, after she learned that another woman had been subjected to inappropriate sexual conduct, and decided she needed to take action to protect women at the company.\nCasucci said in the complaint that Ernst & Young did not take action against Martinkat, but asked her to speak to an outside employment defence lawyer it had hired, and refused to promise that the interview would not be used in litigation.\nCasucci said she was forced to “rebuild her entire book of business from scratch” to avoid working with Martinkat.
