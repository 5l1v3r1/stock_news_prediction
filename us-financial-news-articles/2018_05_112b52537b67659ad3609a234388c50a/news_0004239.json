The University of Connecticut somehow lost track of Raymond Neag, a co-founder of medical-device maker Arrow International Inc. A chance conversation over Thanksgiving dinner in 1995 brought them back together.\nMr. Neag was sitting next to a niece, Sally Reis, a professor in UConn’s education department. They talked about her work in education of gifted students. He said he might want to make a gift to UConn. Before long, UConn officials were taking Mr. Neag to basketball games and talking about their aspirations.\nHe ended up donating more than $45 million to the university, largely for teacher education. UConn named its school of education after him.\n“If we’re going to make an impact, it’s got to start at a very, very early age,” he said in 1999. “Some people say that if you get a child in his formative years, he’s yours forever.”\nMr. Neag was the son of Romanian immigrants who raised eight children in Torrington, Conn., during the Depression. After serving in the Air Force and earning a political science degree at UConn, he became an executive in the medical-device industry.\nMr. Neag died April 19 of heart failure at his home in Goshen, Conn. He was 86.\nEdward Allenby was the UConn vice president who went to see Mr. Neag after being alerted by his niece. “He looked me in the eye and said, ‘Where have you been? It’s been 35 years since anybody has been in touch,’” Mr. Allenby told the Hartford Courant in 1999.\nRelated\nJudith Leiber Escaped Holocaust and Made Sparkly Handbags for the Rich and Famous May 4, 2018 Vel Phillips Fought Six Years to Allow Blacks to Live Where They Wished May 4, 2018 Richard Jenrette Took an Unconventional Path to Riches on Wall Street April 27, 2018 Martin Whitman Invested in Troubled Companies Others Shunned April 27, 2018 Mr. Neag had donated to Harvard, Penn State and other schools but had made only a small gift to UConn, about $6,000 of stock. “Nobody ever asked,” he told the Courant. “I used to think maybe they lost my address.”\nRaymond Neag (pronounced NEE-ag) was born July 16, 1931, the youngest of his parents’ eight surviving children in Torrington. His father worked in a foundry, and the family of 10 squeezed into a small house with one bathroom. During the Korean War, Mr. Neag served in the Air Force at a base in England, where he met his first wife, the former Lynn Wood.\nHe then completed his education and went to work in sales and marketing for a maker of medical devices and served as president of a dental-products company. In the early 1970s, Rockwell International Corp. hired him for its Arrow division in Reading, Pa., which made needles for industrial sewing machines. His job included helping expand the division’s sideline in hypodermic and suture needles.\nBy 1975, Rockwell wanted to sell the Arrow division. Mr. Neag teamed up with three other men to buy it and create Arrow International. One of the partners, Marlin Miller, became CEO. Mr. Neag had various titles, including vice chairman, and was responsible for sales and marketing.\nArrow came up with new ways to package catheters in sterilized kits containing local anesthetic, gauze and sutures. The company’s product line featured so-called vascular-access catheters allowing doctors to deliver drugs or monitor blood in veins and arteries of critical-care patients.\nEventually, Arrow sold the textile-related business and focused purely on medical products. The company went public in 1992. With part of his newfound wealth, Mr. Neag gave a new car to each of his siblings.\nTeleflex Inc. acquired Arrow for about $2.1 billion in 2007.\nMr. Neag’s first wife died in 1996. He married the former Carole Hogan in 1999. She survives him.\nThe Neags also contributed to medical and arts causes in Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Mr. Neag enjoyed reading about history and collected stamps.\nWrite to James R.
