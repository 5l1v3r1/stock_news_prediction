REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The cost of the fix was $119 million, people familiar with the situation had previously told Reuters.\nThe Pentagon had stopped accepting the jets on March 29, the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program office told Reuters in a statement. The dispute was over who was responsible for paying to fix corrosion related to an error discovered in the second half of 2017.\nThe military, U.S. allies that own F-35s and Lockheed Martin are making the necessary repairs to all aircraft, the Pentagon’s office in charge of the fighter program said in the statement.\nThe majority of aircraft will be repaired within two years, the statement said.\nShares of Lockheed added to gains after the news and were up 1.4 percent at $315.90 in late afternoon.\nLast year, the Pentagon stopped accepting F-35s for 30 daysafter discovering corrosion where panels were fastened to theairframe, an issue that affected more than 200 of the stealthyjets. Once a fix had been devised, the deliveries resumed, andLockheed hit its target aircraft delivery numbers for 2017.\nA lack of protective coating at the fastening point thatwould have prevented corrosion was identified as the primaryproblem, the Pentagon said at the time.\nOn Monday, Lockheed said an agreement had been reached with the Pentagon, adding that it expected to hit its F-35 delivery target of 91 aircraft for 2018.\nReporting by Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by Chris Sanders and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T22:29:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
