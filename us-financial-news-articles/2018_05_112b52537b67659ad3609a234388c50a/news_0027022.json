Its organic revenue rose just 1.7 percent in the first half, compared to a 4.8 percent rise at Compass, which was helped by expansion in its business supplying old people’s homes and schools in North America.\n“While the company’s description of growth in the healthcare & seniors and education subdivisions in North America was somewhat vague, Compass is certainly not experiencing issues in these businesses to the degree which caused Sodexo to profit warn recently,” Morningstar analysts said in a note.\nSodexo shares, down by a third since the middle of last year, were down 1.2 percent in morning trade in Paris.\nCompass, which provides meals for office workers, pensioners, soldiers and school children around the world, lost long-time chief executive Richard Cousins in a seaplane crash on New Year’s Eve.\nCousins was seen as the architect of the company’s success over the last decade and analysts and investors are watching the company’s performance closely under his replacement Blakemore for signs of how business will now pan out.\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year forecast. It said it expected to see the benefits in the second half from actions it has taken to address cost pressures in its home market.\n$1 = 0.7394 pounds $1 = 0.7392 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:22:35.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
