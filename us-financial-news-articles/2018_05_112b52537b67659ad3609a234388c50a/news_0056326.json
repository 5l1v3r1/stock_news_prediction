Did the controllables really well, ... serving well and, you know, when I am on the front foot not laying back on the point,” Edmund told reporters.\nThe South African-born youngster has made big strides in the past five months, defeating Novak Djokovic and David Goffin on his way to the quarter-finals in Madrid this month and breaking into the top 20.

He rose to a career high 17th in the ATP rankings last week after reaching the third round of the Rome Open.\nEdmund reckoned on Murray still claiming a place among the top four or five players if he were fit and said his own focus was on climbing higher still in the world rankings.\n“It’s nice to be the number one Brit,” Edmunds said. “It’s nice but it doesn’t change anything. It’s like I have got to keep working and try to get better.”\n“For me, it’s the world ranking you obviously want to improve.” Reporting by Richard Lough; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:14:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
