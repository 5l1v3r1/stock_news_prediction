Users can also consult doctors via the platform.\nThe pre-IPO fund raising comes after rival Ping An Good Doctor, formally known as Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd ( 1833.HK ), raised $1.1 billion in an IPO this month but saw its shares tumble soon after as investors worried about its high valuation.\nThe firm said it would use the funds to accelerate its expansion plans, helping it better tap into the country’s “flourishing and enormous market”.\nAIA said it had made a “minority equity investment” in WeDoctor and had an agreement to be its “preferred provider” of life and health insurance, a boost as insurers race to tap into China’s life insurance market, the world’s third largest.\nChinese healthcare spending is set to hit $1 trillion by 2020, up from $357 billion in 2011, according to consultancy McKinsey & Co, with private healthcare providers and insurers looking to take a larger slice of the market.\nWeDoctor, which has four main units focused on healthcare, cloud, insurance and pharmaceuticals, said it has on its platform over 2,700 hospitals, 220,000 doctors, 15,000 pharmacies and 27 million monthly active users.\nDeutsche Bank advised AIA and WeDoctor on the transaction.
