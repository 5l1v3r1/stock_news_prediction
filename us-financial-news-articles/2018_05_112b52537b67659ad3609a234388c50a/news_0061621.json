REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/File Photo The proposal appears aimed to combat rising nationalism and euroscepticism that led to Britain’s vote to quit the bloc and political turmoil in Italy, a country where widespread support for the European Union has given way to increasing resentment.\n“Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the Union’s future,” the Commission said in its proposal for a 30 billion euro ($35 billion) budget for 2021-2027, up from 14.7 billion euros in the current seven-year period.\nFILE PHOTO: European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen attends a news conference on the launch of VentureEU, a Pan-European Venture Capital Funds-of-Funds programme in Brussels, Belgium, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Vidal/File Photo “Every euro that we invest in Erasmus is an investment in our future,” Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said of the scheme that allows university students to spend a year studying in another EU member state.\n“It is the very essence of a borderless Europe,” he added.\nThe proposal, which requires the approval of member states, would triple the number of participants to 12 million in the next seven-year period and would expand it to youth workers, school pupils, trainees and sports coaches.\nReporting by Megan Dollar; editing by Francesco Guarascio and Robin Pomeroy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
