(Nasdaq: ACLS) today announced financial results for the first 2018.\nThe Company reported first quarter revenue of $122.2 million, compared to $116.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating profit for the quarter was $18.5 million, compared to $10.8 million for the fourth quarter. Net income for the quarter was $13.9 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $91.7 million, or $2.68 per diluted share. First quarter net income is after a non-cash tax expense of $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter net income was increased by a tax benefit of $81.6 million due principally to the release of a tax valuation allowance and related impacts. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $148.5 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $140.9 million on December 31, 2017.\nPresident and CEO Mary Puma commented, \"During the quarter, we entered into a strategic agreement for distribution and support with SCREEN Semiconductor Solutions to bring the Purion platform to the Japanese market. In addition, we shipped our first Purion H to a new foundry logic customer for use in their most advanced logic process. The Japanese market combined with the advanced logic market provides Axcelis access to an additional $300 million in potential revenue opportunity. We are very pleased with our first quarter results. Demand for the Purion platform was strong across all industry segments, allowing us to capitalize on a broad and diverse customer base.\"\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the second quarter ending June 30, 2018, Axcelis expects revenues of between $114 and $118 million. Gross margin in the second quarter is expected to be around 38%. Second quarter operating profit is forecasted to be approximately $15.5-16.5 million. Earnings per share is expected to be between $0.34 and $0.36, which is after an expected non-cash tax expense of $0.10 per share.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today at 5:00 pm ET to discuss the Company's results for the first quarter.

These statements, which include our expectations for spending in our industry and guidance for future financial performance, are based on management's current expectations and should be viewed with caution. They are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ in the many of which are outside the control of the Company, including that customer decisions to place orders or our product shipments may not occur when we expect, that orders may not be converted to revenue in any particular quarter, or at all, whether demand will continue for the semiconductor equipment we produce or, if not, whether we can successfully meet changing market requirements, and whether we will be able to maintain continuity of business relationships with and purchases by major customers. Increased competitive pressure on sales and pricing, increases in material and other production costs that cannot be recouped in product pricing and instability caused by changing global economic, political or financial conditions could also could cause actual results to differ in our forward-looking statements. These risks and other risk factors relating to Axcelis are described more fully in the most recent Form 10-K filed by Axcelis and in other documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Axcelis:\nAxcelis (Nasdaq: ACLS), headquartered in Beverly, Mass., has been providing innovative, high-productivity solutions for the semiconductor industry for over 40 years.
