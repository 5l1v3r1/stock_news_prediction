A source close to the president said Cottarelli had asked for more time to choose his team but had not mentioned giving up his mandate.\nSources from several of Italy’s main parties said they were in favour of fresh elections on July 29, following an inconclusive vote on March 4.\nReporting by Massimiliano Di Giorgio and Gavin Jones; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:08:44.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
