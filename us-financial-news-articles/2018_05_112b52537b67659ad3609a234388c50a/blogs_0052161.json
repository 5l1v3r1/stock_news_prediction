They managed to repeal the individual mandate, which required most people to have some form of health insurance or pay a tax penalty, as part of the broader tax law it passed in December. The change is slated to go into effect next year.\nThis coupled with higher premiums will cause 3 million more people than previously forecast to be uninsured next year, CBO estimates. Between 2019 and 2028, it expects the number of uninsured people to increase to 35 million.\nAfter next year’s double-digit increase, premiums in the benchmark silver Obamacare plans will continue rising about 7 percent each year between 2019 and 2028, the CBO report said.\nThis year, the average premium for these plans is about 34 percent higher than it was last year, according to the report. Eliminating cost-sharing reductions from the federal government, a larger percentage of people living in areas with only one insurer in the marketplace and insurers expecting less enforcement of the individual mandate this year primarily caused the increase, the CBO said.\nThe CBO estimates the federal government will spend $685 billion subsidizing health care for adults under the age of 65 this year. By 2027, about 3 million fewer people than previously projected will receive federal subsidies through Obamacare marketplaces, according to CBO’s estimates.\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Interview published this week showed the rate of Americans with health insurance didn’t improve last year for the first time since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010.", "external_links": ["https://insurancewikis.com/insurica-acquires-zodrow-neighbors-in-oklahoma/", "https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53826-healthinsurancecoverage.pdf", "https://insurancewikis.com/category/insurance-news-articles-updates/", "https://insurancewikis.com/some-obamacare-premiums-to-jump-15-in-2019-estimate-of-uninsured-in-2027-rises-by-5-million-cbo/#respond", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "https://insurancewikis.com/author/admin/"], "published": "2018-05-24T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T01:37:06.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
