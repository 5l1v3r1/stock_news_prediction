PEANUTS AND SENSORS\nEMI currently commands 15 percent of the music publishing industry which combined with its Sony ATV business would make the Japanese giant the industry leader with market share of 26 percent, a company spokesman said.

At that time, its PlayStation 4 would be nearing the end of a game console’s typical life cycle.\nSony’s shares finished 2 percent lower, hurt in part by the expected decline in profits for its gaming business.
