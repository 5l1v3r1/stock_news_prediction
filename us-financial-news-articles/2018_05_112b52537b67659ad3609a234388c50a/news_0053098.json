The presentation is also available on Acacia Research’s website at www.acaciaresearch.com .\nThe presentation highlights the Acacia Board’s and management team’s successful efforts to diversify the Company’s business beyond its core patent licensing business and to position the Company for long-term growth and value creation. The materials show why the Company’s director nominees, Louis Graziadio and Frank (Ted) Walsh, are the right individuals to continue to oversee the Company’s strategy and lead the Company’s transformation. The presentation also demonstrates that the director candidates nominated by Sidus Investment Partners and BLR Partners, two activist hedge funds seeking to replace Mr. Graziadio and Mr. Walsh on Acacia’s Board, have no relevant experience, do not understand Acacia’s business and would not bring any value to the Company and its stockholders.\nDetails of the presentation include:\nAcacia Has Been a Leader in the Patent Licensing and Enforcement Business, But This Business Model Is Facing Significant Statutory and Litigation-Related Headwinds . Like all of its peers, Acacia’s prospects for continued success in the patent licensing business have been negatively impacted by new laws and recent court decisions. As a result, the stock value of all patent pure-play licensing and enforcement companies have declined significantly. Acacia’s Board and Management Team Have Re-Positioned the Company to Take Full Advantage of Acacia’s Assets. After these setbacks in the patent licensing industry – and our own unexpected loss of a major patent case at the end of 2015 – our Board and management team, led by Mr. Graziadio, have transformed the business, cutting fixed expenses, replacing management, refreshing the Board, changing compensation programs and focusing on using our IP and technology knowledge and experience to create value by investing in and partnering with high-growth technology companies. The new strategy has shown early success with investments in two excellent companies: Veritone, Inc., a leading cloud-based Artificial Intelligence technology company, and Miso Robotics, Inc., an innovative leader in robotics and Artificial Intelligence solutions. Each of these investments is currently valued significantly higher than Acacia’s cost basis. Acacia’s Director Nominees Are Highly Qualified and Committed to Creating Long-Term Value for the Company and Its Stockholders. Mr. Graziadio has decades of experience in technology investing, turnarounds, restructurings, spin-offs and IPOs. He was elected Acacia’s Executive Chairman by the Board of Directors in August 2016 and has played a critical role in stabilizing and repositioning the Company, effectively acting as Acacia’s CEO. Mr. Walsh is a seasoned investor with deep experience in originating, investing in, financing, monitoring and exiting private equity investments. Mr. Walsh joined Acacia’s Board in April 2016 and is currently the Chairman of the Board’s Strategic Review Committee responsible for identifying and implementing new strategic opportunities. Mr. Graziadio and Mr. Walsh have recently purchased approximately $5.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, worth of Acacia shares in the open market. They are both fully committed to the future success of Acacia and fully aligned with other stockholders. Sidus Investment Partners and BLR Partners Are Two Activist Hedge Funds Seeking to Replace Mr. Graziadio and Mr. Walsh on Acacia’s Board. Sidus/BLR Have No Strategy for Improving Value, and Their Nominees Have No Relevant Experience and Own No Acacia Stock. We have met with representatives of Sidus/BLR and their director nominees, hoping to learn more about their experience and qualifications and their ideas for creating value for the Company. Our discussions quickly revealed that none of them understand Acacia’s patent licensing business or our new technology investing strategy or have any value improvement ideas for the Company. Sidus/BLR’s only plan appears to be to sell our assets and use the cash to implement a large stock buyback. We believe that this misguided, short-sighted strategy would be tremendously value destructive. Accordingly, we do not believe that substituting one or both of Sidus/BLR’s nominees for Mr. Graziadio or Mr. Walsh – both of whom are substantial, personal investors in Acacia and whose continued leadership is critical to the success of the Company’s new strategy – would make any sense for the Company and its stockholders. Sidus/BLR Have Been Running Their Election Campaign Based on Misguided and Factually Inaccurate Statements. Not having any constructive ideas or suggestions for creating value for Acacia’s stockholders, Sidus/BLR have conducted their election campaign based on numerous misguided and factually inaccurate claims intended to smear the reputation of Acacia’s current directors and management team; to misstate or mischaracterize facts relating to Acacia’s business strategy, stock performance, investments, executive and director compensation practices, corporate governance and other matters; and to embellish the performance and track record of Sidus/BLR’s director nominees as directors of other public companies. Nonetheless, We Have Tried to Avoid a Proxy Contest and Negotiate a Settlement. While we do not believe that either of Sidus/BLR’s nominees would bring any value to the Company, in an effort to achieve an amicable resolution and avoid a costly and disruptive election contest, we recently offered one of Sidus/BLR’s nominees, Al Tobia, a seat on the Board. We also offered to identify, along with Sidus and BLR, a mutually agreeable second new Board member. This settlement offer was rejected by Sidus/BLR, who continue to insist on having two hand-picked representatives on the Board.\nTHE ACACIA BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS CHOOSE THE RIGHT PATH FOR CONTINUED VALUE CREATION AND VOTE “FOR” THE ELECTION OF ACACIA’S TWO NOMINEES ON THE WHITE PROXY CARD.\nVOTE THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY\nGeorgeson\n1290 Avenue of the Americas, 9th Floor\nNew York, NY 10104\n(888) 566-8006 (Toll Free)\nMACKENZIE\nPARTNERS, INC.\n1407 Broadway - 27th Floor\nNew York, New York 10018\nproxy@mackenziepartners.com\nCall Collect: (212) 929-5500\nor\nToll-Free (800) 322-2885\nABOUT ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION\nFounded in 1993, Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ: ACTG) is an industry leader in patent licensing and partners with inventors and patent owners to unlock the financial value in their patented inventions.
