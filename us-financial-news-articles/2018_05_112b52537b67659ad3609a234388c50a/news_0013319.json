It often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat.\nBefore the outbreak was confirmed, local health officials reported 21 patients showing signs of hemorrhagic fever around the village of Ikoko Impenge, near the town of Bikoro. Seventeen of those later died.\nMedical teams supported by the World Health Organization and medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres were dispatched to the zone on Saturday and took five samples from suspected active cases.\nTwo of those samples tested positive for the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, the ministry said.\n“Since notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported either among the hospitalised cases or the healthcare personnel,” the statement said. Related Coverage Seventeen deaths reported in Congo as Ebola outbreak confirmed\nAfter Congo’s last Ebola flare-up, authorities there approved the use of a new experimental vaccine but in the end did not deploy it owing to logistical challenges and the relatively minor nature of the outbreak.\nThe worst Ebola epidemic in history ended in West Africa just two years ago after killing more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it rolled through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.\nDespite regular outbreaks every few years, death tolls in Congo have been significantly lower.\n“Our top priority is to get to Bikoro to work alongside the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners to reduce the loss of life and suffering related to this new Ebola virus disease outbreak,” said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response.\n“Working with partners and responding early and in a coordinated way will be vital to containing this deadly disease.”\nHealth experts credit an awareness of the disease among the population and local medical staff’s experience treating for past successes containing its spread.\nCongo’s vast, remote geography also gives it an advantage, as outbreaks are often localized and relatively easy to isolate.\nIkoko Impenge and Bikoro, however, lie not far from the banks of the Congo River, an essential waterway for transport and commerce.\nFurther downstream the river flows past Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital Kinshasa and Brazzaville, capital of neighboring Congo Republic - two cities with a combined population of over 12 million people.
