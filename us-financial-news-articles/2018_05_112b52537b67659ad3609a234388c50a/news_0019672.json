Mediapro was not immediately available for comment.\nThe tender had already been suspended in mid-April after Sky Italia had requested the court to verify whether the sale respected Italian regulation.\nIn February, Italy’s Serie A soccer league had accepted Mediapro’s offer for the rights to broadcast the almost 400 matches of the 2018-2021 seasons at just above 1.05 billion euros ($1.24 billion).\nSky Italia welcomed the decision saying it “made clarity to the benefit of all participants... setting out the requirements for the procedure.”\nIt added in a statement that it was ready to make an offer for the TV soccer rights.
