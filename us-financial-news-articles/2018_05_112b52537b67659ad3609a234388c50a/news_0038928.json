Researchers at West Virginia University, working with an environmental nonprofit, caught the fraud through on-road testing in 2014.\nThe audit recommends a series of other mostly procedural steps, such as better internal controls on the EPA's testing. It also urges federal regulators to increase information sharing with California's state air board, which also began looking harder at VW diesel cars in the wake of the university study.\nEPA air regulators have agreed to the recommendations, the audit says.\nThe EPA said its revised testing since the VW scandal helped discover at least one other automaker attempting to alter emission controls, auditors said.\nThe EPA cited Fiat Chrysler in January 2017 over what the audit called an illegal emissions device in some of the company's diesel pickup trucks. Fiat Chrysler has denied wrongdoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T10:06:38.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
