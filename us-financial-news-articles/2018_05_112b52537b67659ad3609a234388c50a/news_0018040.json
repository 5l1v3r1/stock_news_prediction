Your article should be a strong argument about an issue in the news. And it should not be a response to a Journal article; that is a letter to the editor. For an idea of what we are looking for, read the Journal's editorial page on a regular basis.\nWe prefer that the submission be between 400 and 1,000 jargon-free words, submitted as the body of an email rather than an attachment. A cover note giving a brief summary of your article should be included along with the author's day and evening phone numbers.\nWe will contact authors on timely articles that are of interest to us as soon as possible. Otherwise, due to the large volume of submissions, for articles that we are not able to use, we will respond within 10 business days. Again, due to the large volume of submissions, please do not call to confirm receipt or check for a status until 10 business days have elapsed.\nAll op-eds should be directed to the Editorial Features Editor, James Taranto, at edit.features@wsj.com . If you are responding to an article that has appeared in the Journal, please send your comments to Timothy Lemmer, the letters editor, at wsj.ltrs@wsj.com .\nIf we accept your article, you will be required to sign a contract giving us exclusive rights to it for 30 days after publication.\nThank you for your cooperation and thank you for your interest in the Journal.\nCheers,\nJames Taranto\nEditorial Features Editor\nThe Wall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T08:45:52.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
