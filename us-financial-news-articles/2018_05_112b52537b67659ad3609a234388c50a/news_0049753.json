The average retail price of diesel is currently 3.595 reais per liter.\nBrazil is a key global supplier of grains, meat, coffee and sugar — most of which reach ports by road. Soy futures rose in Chicago on Tuesday for a second straight day as the protests threatened to halt shipments of Brazil’s record soybean harvest.\nBrazil’s third largest poultry and pork processor, Cooperativa Central Aurora Alimentos, said on Tuesday it planned to halt operations at 15 plants in the country on Thursday and Friday because of the road transport snarls.
