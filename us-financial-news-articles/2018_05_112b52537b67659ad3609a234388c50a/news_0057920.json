REUTERS/Emmanuel Dunand/Pool via REUTERS\nAmong Scotland’s arguments, she cited a risk that Scottish businesses would suffer a competitive disadvantage to neighbours in Northern Ireland if, as the EU is offering, the latter stays broadly within the EU’s economic regulatory system to avoid a disruptive “hard border” with EU member Ireland.

Scotland voted against independence from the UK in 2014. Two years later, in a referendum on EU membership, an overwhelming majority of Scots voted to remain but Britain as a whole voted to leave.
