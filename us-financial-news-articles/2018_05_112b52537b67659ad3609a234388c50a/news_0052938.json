Bayern recognized it was not a bad idea and a month later Sandro Wagner arrived in Munich.\n“That was the plan,” Lewandowski told the Polish newspaper Fakt in early April, after winning a fourth Bundesliga title with Bayern and a sixth overall after the pair he had earned at Borussia Dortmund.\nBayern secured the title against Augsburg while the Polish captain sat out that game on the bench and Lewandowski ended up playing his fewest minutes in a season since his debut 2010-2011 Bundesliga campaign at Dortmund.\nIt still did not stop him creating history in April when he came off the bench against Hannover to score his 105th league goal for Bayern, the most by any foreign player for a German club.\nHe also took a third Torjaegerkanone prize as the season’s top scorer in the league, a feat achieved before only by Germans Gerd Mueller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.\n“Since the beginning of the year I tried to slow down and play optimally. I didn’t want to play each game and butcher myself,” explained Lewandowski.\n“It gives nothing to me and the team in the long run. I always had to be available even though I had struggled with injuries.\n“Now the situation has changed. I can sit on the bench sometimes and don’t need to get up. It’ll play an important role in my preparations, especially given the World Cup on the horizon.”\nEditing by Ian Chadband\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:30:05.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
