REUTERS/Max Rossi/File Photo\nThe “contract” between the League and the 5-Star Movement, the two parties that won the most parliamentary seats in an election on March 4, still needs the approval of their memberships in informal votes to be concluded by Sunday.\n“Days and nights of work,” League leader Matteo Salvini said on Twitter, where he distributed the final programme. “Do you like it?”\nSalvini said he and 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio would meet President Sergio Mattarella on Monday. Mattarella must give his blessing to the programme and to their candidate for prime minister, who has yet to be named, before a government can be formed.\n5-Star launched an online vote to get the approval of its members, reflecting its credo of direct democracy, to be concluded at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).\nThe document, published after 11 weeks of political stalemate in the euro zone’s third-largest economy, calls for billions of euros in tax cuts, additional spending on welfare for the poor, and a roll-back of pension reforms.\nThe euro sank on the latest developments on Friday and was headed for its fifth straight weekly fall against the dollar, in what would be a first for the currency since 2015.\n“The possibility of a eurosceptic government in Rome is shaking investor confidence ... at this point, a larger fiscal deficit and greater bond issuance (in Italy) does seem likely,” said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets.\nThe euro gave up gains and fell 0.2 percent to $1.1778 after the Italian parties outlined their economic plans. It settled near a five-month low reached on Wednesday of $1.1763.\nThe final accord dropped a previous draft proposal, seen by Reuters, to create fiscal headroom by adjusting the formula used to calculate debt burdens in the EU, and contained nothing questioning Italy’s membership of the euro.\nBut it still called for a review of EU governance and fiscal rules — setting the stage for the bloc’s biggest political challenge since Britain voted to leave two years ago.\nBoth parties have a history of euroscepticism. 5-Star has moderated its position over the last year, but the League still wants to leave the euro zone as soon as politically feasible.
