On track for land deliveries at the end of 2019. Milestone approvals secured for additional commercial entitlements in San Francisco while moving forward with infrastructure at Candlestick. Sale of 33 acres for $166 million with approval to build 536 homes in the Great Park Neighborhoods. Company maintains strong credit profile, including total liquidity of $902 million and debt to total capitalization of 24.1% at March 31, 2018.\nALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Five Point Holdings, LLC (“Five Point” or the “Company”) (NYSE:FPH), an owner and developer of large mixed-use, master-planned communities in California, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Emile Haddad, Chairman and CEO, commented that “Five Point has benefited from a strong start to the year driven by continued operational progress. Economic tailwinds in the form of sustained job growth and limited housing supply in our core markets suggest that the value of our land portfolio will steadily appreciate. Our ongoing efforts to develop Newhall Ranch have continued. As a result, we believe that we are positioned to generate revenues in that community sometime toward the end of 2019. In San Francisco, the receipt of certain milestone approvals leaves us on track to acquire another two million square feet of commercial entitlements before the end of 2018. We continue moving forward with infrastructure at Candlestick Point. At the Shipyard, we are having discussions with the City of San Francisco as it relates to the timing of land conveyance. In the Great Park Neighborhoods, buyer demand at Cadence Park, which opened its first phase in March, has been brisk. We have also been active since the end of the quarter. In April, the Great Park Venture made a cash distribution of $235 million to holders of legacy interests. In May, the Great Park Venture completed the sale of 33 acres for $166 million, or $5 million per acre, in the Great Park Neighborhoods. This transaction further validates our view of the residual value of our assets. We remain firmly committed to maximizing the value of our assets while maintaining a strong financial position.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Results\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, total liquidity of $902 million was comprised of cash and cash equivalents totaling $778 million and borrowing availability of $124 million under our $125 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Total capital was $1.9 billion, reflecting $3.0 billion in assets and $1.1 billion in liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues. Revenues of $15.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were primarily generated from management services. Our adoption of new revenue accounting guidance on January 1, 2018 has resulted in accelerated recognition of revenue that reflects the impact of variable incentive compensation in our development management agreement with the Great Park Venture. Historically, revenue was not recognized until contingencies related to the amount and timing of the consideration were resolved. Under new revenue guidance, however, we will recognize the revenue that we expect to receive over the projected contract term and as to which a significant reversal is unlikely to occur.\nOther income. Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a $6.7 million gain on the sale of the Tournament Players Club at Valencia golf course in our Newhall segment, in addition to interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents during the three-month period.\nEquity in loss from unconsolidated entities. Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The loss was primarily due to our proportionate share of the Great Park Venture's net loss during the quarter of $14.7 million. After adjusting for amortization and accretion of the basis difference, our equity in loss from our 37.5% percentage interest in the Great Park Venture was $4.1 million. Equity in earnings from our 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture was $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nSelling, general, and administrative. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $28.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and were largely comprised of employee related costs, including $3.4 million in share based compensation expense.\nNet loss. Consolidated net loss for the quarter was $14.3 million. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled $9.1 million, resulting in a net loss attributable to the Company of $5.2 million.\nSegment Results\nNewhall Segment. We are continuing our land development activities with a focus on Mission Village and expect to start delivering homesites to builders in late 2019. Mission Village is approved for up to 4,055 homesites and approximately 1.6 million square feet of commercial development.\nTotal segment revenues were $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 and were derived from agricultural leasing and the sale of citrus crops. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nSan Francisco Segment. We are continuing our land development activities at Candlestick Point. We are also working with the City of San Francisco to increase the total amount of commercial entitlements at The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point by over two million square feet. We recently received milestone approvals for these new entitlements from several agencies, including the Planning Commission, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure. As a result, we anticipate receiving final approval for increased commercial square footage sometime before the end of 2018.\nTotal segment revenues were $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2018. Revenues during the quarter were mostly attributable to fees generated from management agreements. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $6.4 million for the first quarter.\nGreat Park Segment. A favorable operating environment has resulted in solid sales performance at the Great Park Neighborhoods. Parasol Park is substantially sold out, and sales at Cadence Park, the Great Park Venture's newest neighborhood, which opened its first phase in March, are off to a good start.\nTotal segment revenues were $10.5 million for the first of quarter 2018. Revenues were mainly attributable to management services that we provided to the Great Park Venture. The Great Park Segment's net loss for the quarter was $11.4 million, which included a net loss of $14.7 million attributed to the Great Park Venture that is not consolidated in our financial statements. After making adjustments to account for a difference in investment basis, the Company’s equity in loss from the Great Park Venture was $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nCommercial Segment. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the commercial segment recognized $6.8 million in revenues from a triple net lease with Broadcom and property management services provided by us. Segment expenses were mostly comprised of depreciation, amortization and interest expense totaling $5.1 million. Segment net income was $0.7 million. Our share of equity in income from the Gateway Commercial Venture totaled $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nIn conjunction with this release, Five Point will host a conference call today, Monday, May 14, 2018 at 5:00 pm Eastern Time.
