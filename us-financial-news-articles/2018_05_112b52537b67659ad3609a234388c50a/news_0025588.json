REUTERS/Oh Hyun The exclusive Kasumigaseki Country Club scrapped its male-only membership in March 2017 after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stated it would find another venue if the policy remained in place.\nThe club said on Friday that it had granted three women equal membership rights as their male counterparts for the first time in four decades.\n“This May is the first time we have accepted full membership after changing our rules,” club general manager Hiroshi Imaizumi said.\nUntil the rule change, Kasumigaseki allowed women to play at the course but they were not allowed to become full members or play on certain Sundays, unlike male members.\nThe Saitama venue is scheduled to host both men’s and women’s tournaments in July and August 2020.\nTokyo 2020 organizers said they were delighted with the change in policy.\n“We appreciate the significant efforts the club’s leadership and members made last year to amend the club’s membership policy in keeping with the spirit of the Olympic charter,” said Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya.\n“The club is an outstanding venue with excellent courses and we are pleased it will be hosting the world’s top-tier golfers for the Olympic Games.”\nGolf was re-introduced to the Olympic program for the 2016 Rio Games after a 112-year absence.\nSeveral notable golf clubs have changed their policies to allow female members in recent years.\nIn 2014, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews decided to allow women to join following 260 years of exclusion, after Augusta National, home of the U.S. Masters, had ended its men-only membership two years earlier.\nEarlier this year, Muirfield voted to admit women members, scrapping a policy that led to the historic Scottish links course being stripped of its eligibility to host the British Open.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:25:41.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
