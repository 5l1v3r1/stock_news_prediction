BUYING FOOD ONLINE\nA separate survey of 2,000 web users conducted from April 12 to April 23 by Fevad and Mediametrie also showed that 47 percent of those polled had already purchased one food item online.\nSome 54 percent of those purchasing food online shopped at least once a month online and 28 percent at least twice a month.\nDrive-through services - where consumers order online but collect the shopping by car - and home delivery made 42 percent and 34 percent, respectively, of the delivery modes chosen for food purchased online, with the average order worth 80 euros.\nAmazon has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its global ambitions to expand into food retail.\nIn March, Casino’s upmarket Monoprix chain became the first local retailer to agree to sell groceries via Amazon Prime in Paris. $1 = 0.8544 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T11:18:40.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
