Collecting more revenue to help pay for the reinstatement of a national, industry-wide health insurance fee of 3 percent also helped its overall medical cost ratio.\nThe flu dragged on the ratio by 50 basis points, Aetna said.\nPROFIT TOPS ESTIMATES\nAetna's net income was $1.21 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $381 million, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier that was related to costs for its failed deal to buy Humana Inc..\nExcluding items, the company reported earnings of $3.19, ahead of analysts' average estimate of $2.97, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose to $15.34 billion from $15.17 billion.
