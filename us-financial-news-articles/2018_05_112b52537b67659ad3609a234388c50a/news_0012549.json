We have been very busy the past 12 months building and developing a strong portfolio of technology assets. Now we are seeking opportunities to acquire companies with existing revenue that can benefit from the technology resources the Company already holds. We believe that the technologies we have developed and acquired are extremely valuable in the right setting; therefore, with the right acquisitions and the strategic use of our existing technology assets, we are seeking quick growth and sustainable business operations that will provide great longevity in this sector.”\nThe Company stated that they are currently concluding their due diligence phase and are planning to make an offer on one or both operations this quarter. Mr. Austin continued, “Our goal is to complete a deal on this quarter’s book and give ourselves the rest of the year to grow and develop the business being acquired. We have a good team in place, a great core set of assets, and now we are getting aggressive on putting these tools to work.”\nAbout SAGD : South American Gold Corp (SAGD) is an operational management company focused on enhancing shareholder value by acquiring and operating under valued tech assets.\nDisclaimer : This release contains forward-looking statements that are based on beliefs of South American Gold Corp. management and reflect South American Gold Corp.'s current expectations as contemplated under section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
