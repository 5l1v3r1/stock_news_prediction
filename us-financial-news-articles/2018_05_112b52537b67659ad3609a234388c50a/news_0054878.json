She was the first woman to lead the FAA and headed the agency during the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\nGarvey has served on United’s board since 2009 and is the North America chairman of Paris-based Meridiam development and investment firm.\nThese corporate shuffles come as United seeks to ward off additional federal oversight in the wake of various customer service failures.\nThe carrier is also struggling to impress investors and improve its lagging financial performance as compared to larger rivals American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.\nShares of United closed up 1.34 percent.\nReporting by Alana Wise; editing by Cynthia Osterman, Tom Brown and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:05:23.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
