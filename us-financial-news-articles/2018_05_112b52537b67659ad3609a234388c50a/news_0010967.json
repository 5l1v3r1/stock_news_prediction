No weapons were found during the operation, which started at dawn and was ongoing.\nSenior officer Bernhard Weber said police believed a ‘lawless area with organized structures’ was developing at the hostel to prevent authorities carrying out deportations, so they took action.\n“We will not let any lawless areas, as were apparent here, develop,” Weber told reporters.\nOn Monday police said they were forced to release the Togolese man due for deportation when around 150 residents of the hostel surrounded and threatened them and damaged one of their cars.

REUTERS/Reuters TV ‘LAW AND ORDER’\nMany politicians, including some Greens, praised the police and said German law must be adhered to. Some on the right said the clashes showed the influx of migrants, many fleeing war in the Middle East, has led to a collapse in law and order.\nGerman authorities are still wading through a backlog of asylum cases, a result of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 open-door migrant policy which has also dented her popularity and hit her conservatives’ popularity in last year’s election.\nConservative Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, former leader of Merkel’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, said he supported the police operation and condemned violence by refugees.\n“Such behavior has to be tackled with the full force of the law,” he told reporters in Berlin. “This is a slap in the face of law-abiding citizens.”\nSeehofer is trying to finalize a deal with his Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners to allow a limited number of family reunions for some migrants, a hotly contested issue. Germany is also trying to find ways to integrate migrants better into the labor market as well as into mainstream society.

This is just the beginning,” said AfD co-leader Alice Weidel.
