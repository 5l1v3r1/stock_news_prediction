NILOOFAR RAHMANI, via The Wall Street Journal Niloofar Rahmani, Afghanistan’s first female airplane pilot, during training in Shindand Air Base, Afghanistan, in March 2013.\nBy Margherita Stancati\nAfghanistan’s first female airplane pilot, who became a symbol of women’s advancement during America’s war there, has been granted asylum in the U.S.\nNiloofar Rahmani, a former Afghan Air Force captain, left her native Afghanistan in 2015 to receive training in the U.S.—and to escape death threats directed at her and her immediate family. Now, U.S. authorities have recognized it is too dangerous for her to return home.\n“I’m really happy and thankful to all the people who made this happen,” Rahmani, 27, said by phone from the U.S. on Tuesday. “All I want now is to go back to my dream of flying.”\nRahmani was 18 when she enrolled in the Afghan military, hoping to achieve her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot. The U.S.-led military coalition touted her as an example of what Afghan women could accomplish under the Western-backed government in Kabul.\nHowever, her story ultimately exposed the limits of what women could accomplish in a deeply conservative country where U.S.-led efforts to empower them have frequently clashed with local culture.", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/afghanistans-first-female-pilot-granted-asylum-in-us-after-receiving-death-threats-2018-05-01"], "published": "2018-05-01T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T21:13:21.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
