Highland is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biome’s.\n“This acquisition is a key step in allowing Highland to start work on a dramatically larger, purpose-built production facility to supply a broad spectrum of innovative cannabis products to Nova Scotians,” said Frank MacMaster, President of Highland. “Biome also has the option to secure a considerably larger parcel of land in Nova Scotia should changes to growing methodologies currently being considered by regulators be enacted in the future.”\nThe expanded Highland facility will include extensive research and development facilities that will also be used by Biome’s external partnerships, including its multi-disciplinary collaboration with St. Francis Xavier University. This feature of the facility is a core component of a cannabis centre of excellence that Highland is planning to establish in Nova Scotia to create a broader cannabis ecosystem in its local community.\nMoreover, through this facility, Highland is looking to introduce a new way to grow pharmaceutical grade cannabis on an industrial scale. This approach is designed to address many of the scale-up challenges that have plagued most licensed producers in Canada since the inception of the MMPR program (precursor to the ACMPR). In addition to allowing a production facility to achieve full production capacity sooner with a consistent and predictable level of quality, it will greatly reduce operating cost profiles while being fully compliant with the restrictions placed on producers under the ACMPR.\nHighland looks forward to sharing additional details on its new production platform in the coming months.\nAbout Biome Grow\nBiome Grow ( whose corporate legal entity name is Cultivator Catalyst Corp .) wholly owns Highland Grow, an Authorized Licensed Producer in Nova Scotia under the ACMPR, P-209 Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and in the late stages of applying for a license under the ACMPR and The Back Home Medical Cannabis Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and in the late stages of applying for a license under the ACMPR. Biome Grow plans on operating a diversified mix of low cost licensed cannabis production facilities across Canada and other jurisdictions in the coming years. Additional growth will be achieved through a mixture of acquisitions and organic growth. Moreover, Biome Grow will integrate a complimentary platform of technologies and services targeted at both the Canadian and international cannabis markets.\nForward-looking statements\nThis news release contains forward‐looking statements and forward‐looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
