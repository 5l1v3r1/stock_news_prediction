We should be at least as fast as we are this year but just making racing better. In my personal opinion,” he said.\nVettel said drivers could offer useful insights.\n“I mean, we are drivers, not to say that we know everything — we don’t know anything about engineering the car — but we know how the cars feel, how to drive the cars and their limitations to overtake,” added the German. “But we’re not really asked.”\nHamilton agreed. “We should make the decisions,” he said.\nNO IDEA Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who has a reputation as one of Formula One’s most exciting overtakers, agreed drivers should be consulted.\n“I have no idea what they’ve changed,” said the Red Bull driver. “I actually heard something maybe yesterday that they’ve already agreed on some aerodynamic rules.\n“I’m not trying to be funny but I genuinely have no idea what they’re doing or what they’ve changed or what they’ve decided.\n“I think regardless, we shouldn’t have to ask, ‘Oh, can you involve us’. We should be involved because we’re the ones driving. We’re not engineers but at the end of the day we’re the ones that know what’s going on in a racing situation.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Neville Dalton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-13T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:08:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
