Oil is Russia’s key export.\nBrent crude oil was up 0.3 percent at $78.45 a barrel after briefly hitting $78.60, its highest since 2014.\nThe rouble, however, shrugged off any support from higher oil prices, shedding 0.1 percent to 61.93 versus the dollar .\nThe rouble has been struggling to recover to levels before the U.S. imposed its latest round of sanctions against Russia in early April, weighed down by the resulting uncertainty and by the Finance Ministry that stepped up its dollar purchases this month.\nVersus the euro, the rouble was 0.1 percent weaker at 73.86 .\nFor Russian equities guide see\nFor Russian treasury bonds see\nReporting by Andrey Ostroukh Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
