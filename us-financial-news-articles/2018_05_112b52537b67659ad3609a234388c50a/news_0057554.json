The Han Solo origin film's three-day estimate currently hovers around $83 million.\nTracking earlier this week suggested \"Solo\" would lift off with $130 million to $150 million. The film, directed by Ron Howard, follows Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, who befriends his future co-pilot and Wookie companion Chewbacca, and meets the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Paul Bettany, Joonas Suotamo, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge round out the cast.\nEarly estimates predicted \"Solo\" could secure the best Memorial Day weekend opening, but it looks like \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" will continue to hold the crown with its $139.8 million in 2007.\n\"Solo,\" the second standalone \"Star Wars\" anthology film, has fallen far behind 2016's \"Rogue One,\" which landed a three-day weekend opening of $155 million. The most recent installment in the franchise -- \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" -- opened less than six months ago. The second film in \"Star Wars\"' sequel trilogy debuted with $220 million domestically.\nWith \"Solo\" as the only new release of the weekend, the rest of the North American box office will be bolstered by a number of holdovers.\n\"Deadpool 2\" should easily score the second slot, heading for a $42 million three-day sophomore frame and a four-day total of around $54 million. As of Friday, the superhero sequel starring Ryan Reynolds has earned $176.8 million.\nThe fifth weekend of \"Avengers: Infinity War\" looks to land in third. The Marvel blockbuster is looking at a $16.9 million three-day estimate, along with a four-day number of $22.1 million.\nIn fourth should be Paramount's \"Book Club.\" The romantic comedy is aiming for $9.6 million in its second weekend. If its four-day cume reaches $12.3 million, that would put \"Book Club's\" domestic tally at $34.5 million. \"Life of the Party\" should round out the top five with around $5 million in its third frame.\n\"Solo\" still boosts the domestic box office 23.1 percent compared to Memorial Day weekend in 2017, according to comScore. Meanwhile, the year-to-date box office continues its positive trajectory with 7.6 percent.\n\"Despite the fact that 'Solo' performed softer than many had projected, a hugely competitive and crowded marketplace gave the industry one of the better performing Memorial holiday weekend totals,\" said box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T20:06:15.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
