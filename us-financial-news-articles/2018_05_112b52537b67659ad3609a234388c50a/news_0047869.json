To brand peaceful activism for Tibetan language as ‘inciting separatism’ is beyond absurd,” he said in a statement.\nThere have been sporadic protests against Chinese rule in Tibetan parts of China for the past few years, most seriously in 2008 ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics.\nBeijing calls Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama a dangerous reactionary who seeks to split off nearly a quarter of the land mass of the People’s Republic of China.\nThe 1989 Nobel Peace laureate, who fled Tibet into exile in India in 1959, denies the charge and says he seeks greater rights, including religious freedom and autonomy, for Tibetans.
