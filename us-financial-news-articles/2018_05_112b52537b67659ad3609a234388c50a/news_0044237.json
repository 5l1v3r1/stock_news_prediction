The office administers the rules for transporting gas in the country.\nThe terminal received approval to raise oxygen limits within the gas it delivers to Britain’s network, “allowing greater diversity of gas composition of future cargoes at South Hook LNG Terminal”, according to its proposal document to the JOGT.\n“The UKCS decline, Groningen production cuts and the closure of Rough long-range storage facility are all resulting in an increase in GB’s (Britain’s) gas import dependency,” it wrote, referring to falling regional supplies. “This modification supports this enhanced gas security of supply requirement.”\nThe terminal, with ExxonMobil and Total as minor shareholders, has been importing LNG from Qatar since it was fully commissioned in 2010. With capacity of 15.6 million tonnes a year, it is one of the biggest in Europe.\nSouth Hook declined to comment beyond its public documents on the issue.
