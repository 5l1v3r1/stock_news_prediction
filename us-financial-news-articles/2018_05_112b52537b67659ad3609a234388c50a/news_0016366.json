The extradition is a chance for traffickers to be prosecuted and punished, Orozco said.\n“Many of our Mexicans disappear from our country to be sexually exploited in New York,” Orozco, who heads the Mexican Commission United Against Human Trafficking, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“We don’t want the traffickers to be free. We don’t want them to be outside in the streets now looking for more victims. Victims deserve at least to have reparations.”\nTraffickers often isolate girls from their families with promises of love or rape them, making it hard for them to return home because of the stigma, ICE said.\nGlobally, more than 40 million people are victims of trafficking, according to the International Labour Organization. An estimated 4 million are forced into sexual exploitation.\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith and Ellen Wulfhorst; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
