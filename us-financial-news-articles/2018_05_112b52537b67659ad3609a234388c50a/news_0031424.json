The cancellations also coincide with a downturn in Turkish equity prices after shares reached a record high in January.\nSok’s book was oversubscribed and 85 percent of the shares was sold to foreign investors, while the remainder was bought by domestic investors.\nShares of Sok will start trading on May 18.
