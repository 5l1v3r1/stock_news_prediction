(OTC:GLFH) announced today that it has experienced additional delays in the filing of its Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOn May 15, 2018, Galenfeha filed a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting an extension to file Form 10-Q. The primary reasons for the continued delay are the implementation of GAAP ASC 606 compliance, of which the company’s management has little experience, and the company’s recent acquisition requires predecessor/successor reporting. Management is working diligently with our auditors to comply with these new regulations and will be filing Form 10-Q as soon as possible.\nContact:\nGalenfeha, Inc.\n817-945-6448\ninfo@galenfeha.com\nCorporate:\n420 Throckmorton Street, Suite 200\nFt.
