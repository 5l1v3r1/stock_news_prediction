(“Cohu”). The transaction is valued at approximately $796 million and is expected to close in the second half of 2018.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Xcerra shareholders are anticipated to receive $9.00 and 0.2109 shares of Cohu common stock for each share of Xcerra common stock held. The firm’s investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether the Company’s Board of Directors failed to satisfy their duties to shareholders, including whether the Board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the Board obtained the best price possible for the Company’s shares of common stock.\nIf you currently own common stock of Xcerra and believe that the proposed buyout price is too low, and you would like to learn more about the investigation being conducted, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.\nAttorneys at Brower Piven have extensive experience in litigating securities and other class action cases and have been advocating for the rights of shareholders since the 1980s.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006268/en/\nBrower Piven, A Professional Corporation\nCharles J.
