That is perhaps one of its most important priorities in terms of trade and development,” said Ahmed Salim, vice president at the Teneo global advisory firm.\nEthiopia’s involvement supported the financing and development of the Sudan and Djibouti ports, he added.\nDjibouti had been seeking investors for its port since it terminated the concession for Dubai’s state-owned DP World to run the port in February, citing a failure to resolve a six-year contractual dispute.\nThe agreement with Ethiopia gave Djibouti the option of taking stakes in state-owned Ethiopian firms. The companies that it may look to invest in include Ethiopian Electric Power and Ethio Telecom – one of Africa’s last remaining telecoms monopolies.\nIt was not clear if Sudan’s agreement involved a similar arrangement with Ethiopia.\nDjibouti’s location is of strategic value to countries such as the United States, China, Japan and former colonial power France, all of which have military bases there.\nThe deal with Djibouti also followed Ethiopia’s agreement to acquire a 19 percent stake in the Port of Berbera in the breakaway Somali region of Somaliland. DP World retains a 51 percent stake there, while the government holds the rest.\nMeanwhile, Khartoum’s deal with Ethiopia came in the wake of another arrangement signed with Turkey, which wants to rebuild Suakin - a ruined Ottoman port city on Sudan’s Red Sea coast - and construct a dock to maintain civilian and military vessels.\nQatar has also agreed to develop the same port to the tune of $4 billion.\n(This story removes extra “a” from Quote: in paragraph 10.)\nEditing by Omar Mohammed and Adrian Croft\nOur ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T03:12:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
