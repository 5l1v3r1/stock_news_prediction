Sure. How might it happen? These types of market conditions – higher interest rates, more volatility are certainly more conductive for differential returns in security selection.\"\nIn fact, those conditions are what helped managers in the $3.2 trillion hedge fund industry post a 0.38 percent gain in April . That brings the total return for the year to 0.39 percent, according to industry tracker HFR.\nThe HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index finished April narrowly ahead of the S&P 500, which posted a loss, including dividends, of 0.38 percent through the first four months.\nIt is the first time the hedge fund industry has outperformed the stock market index since 2008.\n— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.
