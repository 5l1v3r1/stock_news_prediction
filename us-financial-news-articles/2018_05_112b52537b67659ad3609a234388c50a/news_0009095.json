For more information visit www.diamond-hill.com .\nUse of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measure\nAs supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"non-GAAP\"). We believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful measures of our core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business and may enable more appropriate comparison to our peers. These non-GAAP measures should not be a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedule reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data)\n2018\n2017\nTotal revenue\n$\n37,782\n$\n35,134\nNet operating income, GAAP basis\n$\n18,204\n$\n15,837\nNon-GAAP adjustment:\nGains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments, net (1)\n(515)\n584\nNet operating income, as adjusted, non-GAAP basis (2)\n17,689\n16,421\nNon-GAAP adjustment:\nTax provision on net operating income, as adjusted, non-GAAP basis (3)\n(3,934)\n(5,437)\nNet operating income, as adjusted, after tax, non-GAAP basis (4)\n$\n13,755\n$\n10,984\nNet operating income, as adjusted after tax per diluted share, non-GAAP basis (5)\n$\n3.94\n$\n3.20\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding, GAAP basis\n3,492\n3,435\nOperating profit margin, GAAP basis\n48\n%\n45\n%\nOperating profit margin, as adjusted, non-GAAP basis (6)\n47\n%\n47\n%\n(1) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments, net: The gain (loss) on deferred compensation plan investments, which increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense included in operating income, is removed from operating income in the calculation because it is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the income statement, and thus has no impact on net income attributable to the Company.\n(2) Net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the Company's net operating income adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains and losses on investments in the deferred compensation plan.\n(3) Tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure represents the tax provision excluding the impact of investment related activity and is calculated by applying the tax rate from the actual tax provision to net operating income, as adjusted.\n(4) Net operating income, as adjusted, after tax: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the net operating income, as adjusted, less the tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted.\n(5) Net operating income, as adjusted after tax per diluted share: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted after tax, by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n(6) Operating profit margin, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted, by total revenue.\nOur management does not promote that investors consider the above non-GAAP financial measures alone, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThroughout this press release, the Company may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to such matters as anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of assets under management, technological developments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters.
