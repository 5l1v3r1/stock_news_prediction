We’re continuing towards establishing a more healthy relationship.”\nIt is the latest sign of practical reconciliation measures taken since North Korean and South Korean leaders met last month for a first summit in years, and signed a pledge to pursue peace on the peninsula.\nCountries such as Britain, France, Germany and the United States have advised airlines not to fly in North Korean airspace, called the Pyongyang flight information region (FIR).\nMark Zee of Flight Service Bureau, which provides safety information on airspace to airlines, said on Wednesday that North Korea had provided warnings of all missile launches until around 2014 but that gradually ended and by 2016 airlines avoided the airspace entirely.\nHe said a guarantee by North Korea that it would provide warning if it fired a missile would likely be enough for regulators to remove warnings about the airspace.\n“It seems very likely that in the coming months, we will start to see international traffic start to use the Pyongyang FIR again, and may even see some new airways being established,” Zee said in a website post before the ICAO meeting concluded.
