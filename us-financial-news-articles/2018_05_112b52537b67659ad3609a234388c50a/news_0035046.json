Industry analysts estimate there are more than 10 million Android users in Australia.\n“Some mobile plans may only include a few gigabytes of data so if Google is harvesting a gigabyte of data, it is a very real cost to consumers,” said David Vaile, chairman of the industry group, the Australian Privacy Foundation.\nAustralian telecommunications companies said they were seeking confirmation from Google on the allegations.\n“We are aware of the reports in the media and we have asked Google to advise whether they are accurate,” a spokesman for Australia’s biggest telecom company Telsta said.\nThe investigations will raise more questions about the way big technology companies collect and use people’s data online.\nEarlier this year, social media giant Facebook Inc apologised after web marketing firm Cambridge Analytica was accused of obtaining users’ data without permission for the 2016 election campaign of United States President Donald Trump.\nOracle has its own long-running dispute with Google. The U.S. based software company is seeking royalties for Google’s use of some of the Java language, while Google argues it should be able to use Java without paying a fee.
