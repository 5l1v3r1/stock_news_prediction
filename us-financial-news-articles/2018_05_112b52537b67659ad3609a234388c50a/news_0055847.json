The winner gets to share a swanky meal with and learn life lessons from the legendary business investor.\nBuffett started the annual tradition to support his late wife Susie's passion for social justice and, over the past 19 years, Buffett has raised over $26 million for Glide , an anti-poverty non-profit organization based in San Francisco. Co-founders Cecil Williams and Janice Mirikitani tell CNBC Make It that the lunch auction was originally Susie's idea.\n\"We met Susie 25 years ago, but she had actually been coming to Glide for nearly two years before that. She wanted to make sure we were not a cult,\" Mirikitani says with a laugh. \"When she saw we advocated for inclusiveness and social justice for everyone, she started to volunteer.\"\nWhen they were in their 30s, Susie inspired Warren to support social issues. \"When the children were growing up, I was very involved in civil rights. I was immersed in it and I think that's what made Warren a Democrat. He would go with me to hear speakers,\" Susie says in the HBO documentary \"Becoming Warren Buffett .\"\nTogether they supported Omaha's nonviolent activists in the midst of the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as late civil rights activist and icon Martin Luther King Jr .\nIn the 1990s, Susie traveled with Williams and Mirikitani four-to-five times a year, for three years, going to different American cities to train other churches on how to start programs similar to the ones Glide offered.\nBut when Warren first heard about Glide, he was skeptical.\n\"My wife told me a lot about Cecil and I thought, 'This sounds too good to be true', and I am a suspicious guy by nature,\" Buffett tells CNBC reporter Becky Quick in a 2017 interview. \"So she didn't sell me.\"\nPhoto courtesy of the Glide Foundation Susie Buffett volunteering during GLIDE’s free Grocery Bag Giveaway during the holidays. Buffett looked for, and found, the proof he needed. \"But then she took me there one time to Glide and I got to meet Cecil, I got to see what happened, the kind of people he was helping and how he was helping them.\"\nAt that point, Mirikitani recalls, \"Warren looked at Cecil and said 'This guy is real!'\"\nOver the years, Glide has expanded its budget from $35,000 in 1965 to $20 million today, Mirikitani says. Funds raised through Buffett's annual lunch auction now make up 10 percent of that.\nTo this day, Glide, which doubles as a church, helps fulfill the basic needs of marginalized people by providing more than 770,000 meals , affordable health care , mental health services, substance abuse recovery programs and HIV and AIDS prevention programs, among other services .\nPhoto courtesy of the Glide Foundation Susie Buffett volunteering during GLIDE’s free Grocery Bag Giveaway during the holidays. In 2000, Susie came up with the million-dollar lunch auction idea, which Williams and Mirikitani say they happily welcomed. But they struggled to raise anything more than $25,000 during the in-person public auctions in San Francisco until 2003, when Warren proposed running the auction on eBay. By 2008, the auction had a $2 million-bidder for lunch with Warren.\nThough Susie passed away in 2004, Williams and Mirikitani say they still chat with Buffett several times a year. They say they are still in awe of how humble the investor is about his impact and how willing he is to work closely with them.\n\"We can't overlook the fact that he's helping to raise millions of dollars for Glide, but the development of our friendship with Warren has been one of the best parts of this partnership,\" Mirikitani says.\nPhoto by Thomas Walsh Rev Cecil Williams, Warren Buffett and GLIDE Co-founder Janice Mirikitani (Rev. Williams’ wife). Mirikitani adds that \"Warren credits Susie for having really caused him to understand the meaning of unconditional love,\" a value embedded in Glide's mission.\nBuffett also thanks Susie for much of his success in life, calling her one of his \" greatest teachers \" in a 2017 Forbes interview .\n\"Who you marry, which is the ultimate partnership, is enormously important in determining the happiness in your life and your success and I was lucky in that respect,\" Buffett says.\nLike this story?
