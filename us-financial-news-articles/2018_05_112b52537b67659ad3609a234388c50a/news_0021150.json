This business has launched with Precision Therapeutics' investment in Helomics Corporation, a precision diagnostic company and integrated clinical contract research organization whose mission is to improve patient care by partnering with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and academic organizations to bring innovative clinical products and technologies to the marketplace. In addition to its proprietary precision diagnostics for oncology, Helomics offers boutique CRO services that leverage patient-derived tumor models, coupled to a wide range of multi-omics assays (genomics, proteomics and biochemical), and a proprietary bioinformatics platform (D-CHIP) to provide a tailored solution to our client's specific needs. Helomics is 25% owned by Precision Therapeutics. Helomics® is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the company maintains a state-of-the-art, CLIA-certified, clinical and research laboratory. For more information, please visit www.Helomics.com .\nPrecision Therapeutics has also announced the formation of a subsidiary, TumorGenesis to pursue a new rapid approach to growing tumors in the laboratory, which essentially “fools” the cancer cells into thinking they are still growing inside the patient. Precision Therapeutics and Helomics have also announced a proposed joint venture with GLG Pharma focused on using their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients, especially those who present with ascites fluid (over one-third of patients). The growth strategy in this business includes securing new partnerships and considering acquisitions in the precision medicine space.\nSold through the Skyline Medical business of Precision Therapeutics, The STREAMWAY System virtually eliminates staff exposure to blood, irrigation fluid and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment. Antiquated manual fluid handling methods that require hand carrying and emptying filled fluid canisters present an exposure risk and potential liability. Skyline Medical's STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement, and disposal of waste fluids and is designed to: 1) reduce overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers; 2) improve compliance with OSHA and other regulatory agency safety guidelines; 3) improve efficiency in the operating room, and radiology and endoscopy departments, thereby leading to greater profitability; and 4) provide greater environmental stewardship by helping to eliminate the approximately 50 million potentially disease-infected canisters that go into landfills each year in the U.S. For additional information, please visit www.skylinemedical.com .\nContacts:\nInvestor Relations\nKCSA Strategic Communications\nElizabeth Barker\n(212) 896-1203\nebarker@kcsa.com\nMONEYINFO, LLC\nCharles Moskowitz\n617-827-1296\ninfo@moneyinfo-llc.com\nSource:Precision Therapeutics Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2bd2bcb3-e07b-4cc2-921c-1592bc36f2b1", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=B13Tu-xXPGoJhnqd8sq5f-ae6XtHLTnU0__jedJuz4m-mhhuID7qmIQphEC_zL6tJyPq9yGuz27dCo4scUwa1rmmxhrNmZ-bSsok-fYRmwA=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wnRE96UorDZ7sqiMxQkyPG-RJf7SkwY76xVtWgrk1ewicmupi3K4pLVL25LMPmcQcSWI2ZD9e6dletC68KAoEg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=B13Tu-xXPGoJhnqd8sq5f-ae6XtHLTnU0__jedJuz4n_Fs52G6Ptlm2edJMm1F0dOipyMerNLWuyn99xqsxydTh1w6aBlcb2rjeX932yZdU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yyPz6gpMSLV-9B6Kv1yL_3MzqlVOVVqfcbo436idIiBKxPWl_5Jm4uVxYUV1XAGo9izjkZZaqkmzI65-tO3n3K4jU__JwyVsg6y5uW9IiHg=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7Ft8BtB8B-sCCGge8TOjfvxFPrOcXHoFABiiW_CZFhjLbzL4BYkvzgDkZMdPx0_skkNJbSK9_OmkQUTPBwpLpA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bFL2izclrOhovhNAqYU3_70k4p_DrMPUSBiEc_BoCbRippMm1ervyGzoMpdB0gCeWX3iByiQajUh7SmbCDo7PZ4oMWJT16LDjSlaJPlfC0w="], "published": "2018-05-08T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T18:36:53.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
