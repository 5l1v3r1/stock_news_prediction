We’ve seen the capitulation in Turkey and Brazil and before that the U.S.-China trade wars. That’s what’s been driving the rand,” Alwar said.\nGovernment bonds also declined, with the yield on the benchmark 2026 paper rising 9 basis points to 8.53 percent at the local market close.\nOn the bourse, the blue-chip JSE Top-40 index fell 1.8 percent to 49,622 points and the broader All-share index lost 1.6 percent to 55,935.\nSteinhoff Africa Retail was down 0.3 percent, recouping some of the losses suffered earlier after it scrapped half-year dividend payouts.
