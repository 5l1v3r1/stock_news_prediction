Tunisian authorities said they had arrested 10 Tunisians but two foreigners suspected of plotting the killing escaped.\nHamas blamed Israel for the killing of Zawari, who had been a member of its organization for 10 years, it said.\nPolice in Croatia in March arrested a Bosnian citizen wanted by Tunisia on same charges.\nA Croatian court ruled last week to allow his extradition to Tunisia, which his lawyers said they would appeal.\nReporting by Maja Zuvela; Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:37:49.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
