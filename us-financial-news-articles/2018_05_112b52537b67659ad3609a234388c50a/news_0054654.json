The regulations will also help taxpayers understand the relationship between the federal deduction for charitable contributions and the new limit on so-called SALT payments, the agencies said.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress capped the federal SALT deduction at $10,000 in legislation President Donald Trump signed into law in December. Some high-tax states have responded with steps allowing local taxpayers to avoid the cap by instead making fully deductible charitable contributions to state entities.
