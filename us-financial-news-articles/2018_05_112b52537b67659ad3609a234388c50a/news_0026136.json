The analysis was based on data collected by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.\nIsrael has been criticised by human rights groups for its lethal response to the protests. The Israeli military said on Friday its troops were defending the border and “firing in accordance with the rules of engagement”.\nTear gas canisters are fired by Israeli forces at Palestinian demonstrators during a protest demanding the right to return to their homeland, at the Israel-Gaza border in the southern Gaza Strip, May 11, 2018.

Israel’s military “will not allow any harm to the security infrastructure or security fence and will continue standing by its mission to defend and ensure the security of the citizens of Israel and Israeli sovereignty, as necessary.”\nThe Gaza Strip, home to 2 million people, is run by the Islamist group Hamas which has fought three wars against Israel in the past decade. Israel and Egypt maintain an economic blockade of the strip, which has the highest unemployment rate in the world and has become far poorer than the other main Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nOn Thursday in Gaza, Hamas leader Yehya Al-Sinwar described the protests as peaceful, and said: “We hope these incidents will pass without a large number of martyrs and wounded, and the occupation forces must restrain themselves.”\nSamir, a refugee whose grandfather originally came from Jaffa, which now lies 40 miles up the coast in Israel, rolled tyres towards the area close to the fence where he later burned them.\n“My grandfather told me about Jaffa, where he came from, he said it was the bride of the sea, the most beautiful of all. I want to go back to Jaffa,” he said.\nPalestinian demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forces during a protest demanding the right to return to their homeland, at the Israel-Gaza border, east of Gaza City May 11, 2018.
