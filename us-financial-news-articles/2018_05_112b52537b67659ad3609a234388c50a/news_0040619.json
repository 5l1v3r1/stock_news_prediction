People like to look back on it in years to come,” he said.\nAt the “King and Queen” gift shop, a steady flow of customers are picking their souvenirs.\n“Everybody’s going crazy,” Alan Earwaker, 70, said after buying a commemorative mug. “I’ve got people over from Brazil, they’re buying loads and loads of stuff to take back .... Everybody’s wedding mad.” (Reporting By Jonathan Shenfield, Alex Fraser and Emily Roe; additional reporting by Marie-Louise Gumuchian Writing by Emily Roe and Marie-Louise Gumuchian Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
