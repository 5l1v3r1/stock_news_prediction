Tesla’s stock has lost over a quarter of its value since closing at a record high last September.\nA series of fiery Tesla car crashes and executive departures have also worried investors.\nAfter Consumer Reports said on Monday that the Model 3 had “big flaws”, including braking slower than a full-sized pickup truck, Musk responded on Twitter that Tesla would fix the car’s braking system with a software update.\nTesla’s stock was off 0.1 percent on Wednesday at $274.65.\nThe mean analyst price target for Tesla has dipped to $289 from $326 a month ago. Kallo’s target of $411 is about 50 percent higher than Wednesday’s price.\nOn Tesla’s recent quarterly results conference call, Kallo commented that the flow of negative news stories about Tesla was making it difficult for even “believers” to own the company’s stock. Musk responded that investors worried about volatility should steer clear of Tesla’s shares.
