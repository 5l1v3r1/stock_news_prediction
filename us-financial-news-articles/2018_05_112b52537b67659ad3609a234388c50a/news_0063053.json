Safra Group as of May 31, 2018.\n“This completes our exit from the run-off life and annuity businesses and significantly reduces our capital markets exposure,” said The Hartford’s Chairman and CEO Christopher Swift. “We now have greater financial flexibility and a business mix that will improve our ROE and earnings growth profile over time.”\nTotal consideration to The Hartford is approximately $2.05 billion, including cash paid by the buyers, a pre-closing cash dividend, debt included as part of the sale and a 9.7 percent ownership stake in the new company. In addition, The Hartford will retain Talcott Resolution tax benefits with an estimated GAAP book value of approximately $700 million, which will be available for realization subject to the level and timing of The Hartford’s taxable income. Total value of the sale is $2.75 billion, including the total consideration and the carrying value of the retained tax benefits.\nHartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO), The Hartford’s investment management group, has a five-year contract to manage a significant portion of Talcott Resolution’s investment portfolio. In addition, The Hartford will provide to and be reimbursed by Talcott Resolution for certain transition services for up to two years.\nThe new company will operate under the name Talcott Resolution. About 375 of The Hartford’s employees have joined the new company and will be located in offices in Windsor, Connecticut, and Woodbury, Minnesota. “We believe Talcott Resolution is well positioned for continued success with an experienced and talented team with proven operational capabilities, supported by an accomplished investor group,” said The Hartford’s Chief Financial Officer Beth Bombara.\nAbout The Hartford\nThe Hartford is a leader in property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds.
