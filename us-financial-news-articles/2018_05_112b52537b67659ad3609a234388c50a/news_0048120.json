Mahony is also a member of Lilly's executive committee.\n\"On behalf of our executive team and the company, I want to thank Sue for her leadership over the past 18 years,\" said David A. Ricks, Lilly's chairman and chief executive officer. \"Her passion for patients and strong sense of purpose are inspiring to all of us.\"\nMahony led Lilly Oncology through the integration of ImClone, successfully launched several key brands—including Verzenio™—and most recently led the refocusing of the company's oncology R&D strategy. Prior to this, as senior vice president of human resources and diversity, Mahony played a key role in restructuring the company into business units.\nMahony joined Lilly in 2000 after more than a decade in sales and marketing roles in Europe for Schering-Plough, Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb. At Lilly, Mahony has held senior leadership positions in product development, Six Sigma, marketing and general management roles.\n\"What I've appreciated over the years is the opportunity to participate in something greater than myself,\" said Mahony. \"We make medicines that help patients with cancer live longer. What a privilege it's been to wake up each morning with that as my life's work.\"\nLilly is considering internal and external candidates to succeed Mahony.\nAbout Eli Lilly and Company\nLilly is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world.
