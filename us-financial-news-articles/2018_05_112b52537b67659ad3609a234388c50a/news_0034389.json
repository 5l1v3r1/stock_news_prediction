Sentiment in emerging markets was also soured by a plunge of the Turkish lira after President Tayyip Erdogan said he wanted to take tighter control of monetary policy. With debt yields in core markets rising and the dollar renewing its rally in global markets after a 3-day pause, the forint proved the most vulnerable currency in Central Europe. It traded at 317.28 versus the euro at 0907 GMT, off a 22-month low of 317.36, but weaker by 0.6 percent from Monday, while the zloty shed 0.4 percent, to trade at 4.282. The forint got little help from figures that showed faster-than-expected 4.4 percent first-quarter growth in the Hungarian economy. Breaking through a technical support level at 315.5, it was heading towards the next support at 318, Erste analysts said in a note. Hungary's 10-year government bond yield rose 2 basis points to 2.93 percent, tracking a rise in the corresponding U.S. Treasury yield above 3 percent. That was a smaller increase than a 5-basis-point rise in Poland's 10-year yield to 3.27 percent on Tuesday, but the Hungarian yield has risen by about 30 basis points this month, the biggest rise in the region, due to the international rise in debt yields. \"Why Hungarian markets are getting the biggest beating, it is hard to say,\" one Budapest-based currency dealer said. \"This may be happening because interest rates are low and the National Bank (of Hungary) looks unwilling to change them,\" the dealer added. Despite the noise in global markets, the Hungarian central bank is unlikely to give up its ultra-loose policy, and may even deploy new policy tools to keep long-term interest rates lower, Erste analyst Gergely Urmossy said in a separate note. Poland's central bank is also expected to reiterate after its meeting on Wednesday that it could keep rates on hold for years. The region's equity indices mostly fell, led by a 1.6 percent decline in Budapest and a 2.9 percent fall in OTP Bank's stocks which has been jittery around a key technical level at 11,0000 forints ($414.45) in the past two weeks.
