Revenues also increased for 7UP, Tango and our natural energy brand Purdey’s,” the company said.\nThe UK bottler said profit before tax for the 28 weeks ended April 15 fell to 41.8 million pounds from 50.1 million pounds, as it took a charge of 21.6 million pounds.\nThe results included only one week of trading following the introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, the company said, adding it is too soon to judge the consumer response and give a guidance on its impact.\nBritain’s sugar tax levy, which came into force in April, has two thresholds - one of 18 pence per litre on soft drinks with more than 5 grams of sugar per 100 ml and another of 24 pence per litre on those with more than 8 grams per 100 ml.\nNinety-four percent of Britvic’s owned brands and 72 percent of the company’s overall portfolio are either under or exempt from the sugar tax.\nThe company said it sold 1.2 billion litres of soft drinks this year, a 3.6 percent increase from last year. Average realised price for its beverages rose 0.5 percent to 57.4 pence.\nReporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair and Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:22:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
