(NASDAQ: FLKS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company that is developing innovative and proprietary treatments in Phase 2 randomized, controlled trials for muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) under FDA Fast Track designation, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its clinical development and corporate activities.\n\"The past few months have been particularly rewarding on the clinical front, as we achieved significant milestones with positive data in two serious and distinctly different neurological diseases: MS and ALS. We believe these data demonstrate the clear potential of FLX-787 to reduce painful cramps and spasms in these patient populations,” stated Bill McVicar, Ph.D., President and CEO of Flex Pharma. “Fueled by the consistent efficacy demonstrated by FLX-787 against cramps and spasms, and the potential to impact spasticity, I am excited to be driving towards important readouts for our clinical programs over the next year.”\nBusiness Highlights\nClinical Efforts In March, the Company announced positive topline data for FLX-787 from its exploratory Phase 2 trial in MS patients with frequent muscle cramps/spasms and spasticity. FLX-787 at a dose of 19 mg, taken orally twice daily, in a liquid formulation was evaluated in an exploratory Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 57 MS patients. In the evaluation of FLX-787 for its impact on MS patients’ cramps/spasms and spasticity, pre-specified analyses of the parallel portion of the study showed the following: A statistically significant 27.3% reduction in the frequency of cramps/spasms compared with control (p=0.001) A 1.4 day increase in cramp/spasm-free days per 14 day period compared with control (p=0.046) Clinician-rated improvement in spasticity with FLX-787 treatment was significantly better than control (p=0.010) Treating physicians reported that 7 of 28 (25%) patients on FLX-787 had “Much Improved” or “Very Much Improved” spasticity versus 0 of 26 (0%) on control based upon the Clinical Global Impression of Change in Spasticity FLX-787 was generally well tolerated and resulted in no drug-related serious adverse events. GI-related adverse events (diarrhea and nausea) were infrequently reported with FLX-787. In April, the Company initiated an open-label, single dose study in ALS patients to assess the impact of FLX-787 on bulbar functions, including swallowing. Consumer For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded approximately $179,000 in total revenue for its consumer product, HOTSHOT®. In January 2018, the Company announced that it engaged an investment banking firm to assist with the consideration of strategic alternatives for the HOTSHOT consumer business. That review is in progress and the Company expects to report the results of the review in the near future.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash Position: As of March 31, 2018, Flex Pharma had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $23.9 million, estimated to fund operations to mid-2019. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $9.4 million, which is higher than the estimated spend for future quarters. The timing of clinical trial billings and annual bonus payments related to 2017 impacted the cash used in operations during the first quarter, and spend on the consumer business is expected to be lower. Total Revenue: Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $179,000. Cost of Product Revenue: Cost of product revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $84,000. There were no inventory write-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2018. R&D Expense: Research and development expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $4.7 million. Research and development expense for this period primarily included costs associated with the Company’s clinical studies of FLX-787, personnel costs (including salaries and stock-based compensation costs), FLX-787 production costs, and external consultant costs. SG&A Expense : Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $3.7 million. Selling, general and administrative expense for this period primarily included personnel costs (including salaries and stock-based compensation costs), sales, marketing and fulfillment costs related to HOTSHOT, legal and professional costs, and external consultant costs. Net Loss and Cash Flow: Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was ($8.2) million, or ($0.46) per share and included $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense. As of March 31, 2018, Flex Pharma had 17,980,852 shares of common stock outstanding. The net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by the Company’s operating expenses related to its research and development efforts, costs associated with HOTSHOT, and general and administrative costs.\nFinancial Guidance\nBased on its current operating plans and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position, Flex Pharma expects to have sufficient capital to fund its operations to mid-2019.\nUpcoming Events and Presentations\nJefferies 2018 Global Healthcare Conference, June 5-8, 2018 in New York, NY.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe company will host a conference call and webcast today at 9:00 a.m. ET to provide an update on the company and discuss first quarter 2018 financial results.
