But you are getting much more from me, and maybe I should get a share of that revenue,'\" he said. \"And I'm absolutely convinced that this will be the future.\"\nJason Alden | Bloomberg via Getty Images Levy didn't name any lawmakers opposed to such a move, but some governments would likely be cautious about shaving revenue from big tech firms, with the industry already facing tough scrutiny on tax and regulation.\nCurrently, people who use social media sites like Facebook receive access to a free service in return for the company using their data to target them with ads.\nThat model has been thrown into question since it was revealed that Facebook data on 87 million people may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica , a now-defunct consulting firm that was accused of using \"psychographic\" profiling to influence voters for political clients.\nshow chapters GDPR: Why everyone is freaking out over four letters 10:59 AM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 02:53 \"In my view, from an advertising standpoint, we will see a lot of changes coming in the future,\" Levy told CNBC.\nThe ad guru name-checked new EU data laws that started Friday, called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). It forces companies to be more clear on consent to use and share customer data and allows consumers to request that firms delete all information companies have on them.\nLevy said widespread discussion on GDPR would only heightens people's concerns on data sharing.\n\"The more we are speaking about the use of data, you will have people that say 'hey guys, where is my money, you are using my information, you are using everything which is about myself, but I want a share of your revenues.'
