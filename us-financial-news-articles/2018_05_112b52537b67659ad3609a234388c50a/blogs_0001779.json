So, the iPhone X has been a huge success and it's the first time, since we split the lineup back at iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, that the top model has been the top-selling model. That's unprecedented in that history.\"\nCook also spoke to the strength of Apple's sales in China, shrugging off negative estimates that had emerged ahead of the quarter.\n\"In terms of geographies, Greater China grew 21 percent, which was our best growth rate in Greater China in two and a half years. So we are incredibly proud of that,\" the CEO said.\nAnd, when asked about the impact of potential trade war escalation, Cook seemed surprisingly sanguine about the state of U.S.-China relations.\n\"I am pretty optimistic there,\" Cook told CNBC. \"I think that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where the U.S. can only win if China wins, China can only win if U.S. wins and the world can only win if both win.\"\n\"So if you look at what history tells us — that countries that are the most open and most diverse do the best, and the folks that are closed and least diverse, their citizens do the worst — ... it tells us that again and again and again,\" Cook continued. \"And I think both countries know that.\"\nRead the full transcript of Cook's interview here.\nSo, in a market where analyst sentiment going into the quarter can seem way too grim — or, conversely, way too optimistic — Cramer asked investors to remain cautious and do their own homework.\n\"[Apple's] estimates and any enthusiasm that had once been generated by the largest company in the world had long since diminished,\" he said. \"For the vast majority of stocks, though, it's quite the opposite. I'm saying that Apple is the outlier. Many stocks have kind of just been set up for disappointment because, totally unlike Apple, there's been endless number bumps but, more importantly, endless upgrades.\"\nWATCH: Cramer on how Apple earnings could change the market's mood show chapters Cramer reflects on Apple earnings after speaking with CEO Tim Cook 21 Hours Ago | 12:55 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T01:33:40.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
