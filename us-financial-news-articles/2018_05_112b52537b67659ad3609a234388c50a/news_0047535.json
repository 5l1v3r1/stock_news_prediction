Based on these findings, she is now developing curative therapies for deafness. She has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards for her scientific contributions, such as the ARO Lifetime Achievement Award of Merit (USA), the International Brain Prize from Grete Lundbeck Foundation, The Hughes Knowles Prize (USA), the Louis-Jeantet for Medicine Prize for her outstanding contribution to the understanding of the auditory science (Europe), the l’Oréal-Unesco Award recognizing outstanding Women in Sciences (Europe) and the Grand Prize from the INSERM (France).\nShe is a member of the French and American Sciences Academies and the American Medical Academy.\n“Professor Christine Petit has a profound and multidisciplinary understanding of hearing and has made paradigm-changing discoveries in the field,” said Nawal Ouzren, Chief Executive Officer of Sensorion. “We are humbled and honored to have an established leader and world-renowned scientist of Professor Petit’s caliber joining Sensorion.
