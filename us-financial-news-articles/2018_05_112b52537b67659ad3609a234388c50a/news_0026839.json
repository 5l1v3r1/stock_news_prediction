S&P also stated that ICL will generate positive free operating cash flow in 2018-2019.\nIn affirming its rating, S&P emphasized the resilience of ICL's EBITDA driven by the Company's competitive advantages and its continued shift to production of value-added specialty products which enable the Company to maintain stable profitability despite lower margins in the fertilizer segment. In addition, S&P cited ICL's cost reduction and efficiency measures at its global production sites which, despite resulting in higher CAPEX expenditures in the near term, will allow ICL to reduce production costs and improve its competitive position. Overall, S&P expects ICL will generate EBITDA of about $950 million to $1 billion in 2018. In addition, the rating agency considers an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0x at the top of the business cycle and 4.0x at the bottom of the cycle to be commensurate with the current rating.\nThe Company believes that S&P's affirmation of its rating demonstrates the rating agency's confidence in ICL's responsible capital allocation approach. Cash flow generation will continue to be supported by ICL's two pillar strategy to strengthen its core mineral chains through optimization of its mineral assets, growing its downstream businesses through innovation and a value oriented pricing approach as well as growing its Advanced Crop Nutrition business in order to achieve both top and bottom line growth.\nPlease see the full S&P report below or in the following link:\nhttp://www.icl-group.com/investors/reports/immediate-reports/immediate-reports-2018/\nAbout ICL\nICL is a leading specialty minerals and specialty chemicals Company that operates three minerals chains in a unique integrated business model, serving two key markets: agriculture and industrial.
