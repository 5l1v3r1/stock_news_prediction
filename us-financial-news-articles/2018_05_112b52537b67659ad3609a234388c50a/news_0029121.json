Dinis does not set monetary policy.\n“The goal is to have a rapid, collaborative approach to recovery should a key participant be affected by a serious cyber security event, such as the corruption of critical data that results in a prolonged operational outage,” Dinis said in prepared notes for the speech.\nDinis said the bank helped create the Joint Operational Resilience Management Program with the Finance Department, financial market infrastructure owned by Payments Canada, and large Canadian banks, and last year ran an exercise to test escalation and communication protocols during a systemic crisis.\nThe exercise found shortcomings in the financial sector’s ability to coordinate actions in the event of a major disruption.\n“At such a stressful time, the last thing we want is confusion and ambiguity. We are now developing improved protocols to address this shortcoming,” Dinis said.\n“It is no longer enough for each institution to maintain its own alarm system. While doing so provides a certain level of protection and comfort, we need to invest in system-wide defences,” he added.
