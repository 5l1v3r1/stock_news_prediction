REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Wilkie, 55, has been acting secretary of the department since Trump fired Shulkin in March over concerns about unauthorized travel expenses.\nThe Republican president’s first choice to replace Shulkin, Trump’s physician Ronny Jackson, withdrew from consideration last month after allegations that he had been lax with prescription drugs and drank alcohol on the job.\nJackson denied the allegations but faced questions in the Senate confirmation process over whether he had enough experience for the job.\nWilkie successfully went through the Senate confirmation process last year after Trump nominated him to be undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\nThe veterans agency has long been criticized for the quality of care it provides and the red tape that veterans encounter.\nReporting by Steve Holland and Will Dunham; Editing by Paul Simao and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:27:04.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
