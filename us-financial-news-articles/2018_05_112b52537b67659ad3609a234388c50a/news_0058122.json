It had set a price range of $21 to $23 per share for 34.1 million Class A common shares, and sold 38 million shares.\nThe IPO raised $874 million.\nIn another fintech IPO earlier this week, U.S. payments processor EVO Payments' offering was priced at the upper end of its target range.\nGreenSky, a portal for consumers to access home improvement loans, is considered one of the most attractive fintech names in America.\nWhile many technology-driven online lenders such as LendingClub and OnDeck Capital have struggled, weighed down by concerns over underwriting standards and access to funding with which to lend, GreenSky avoids these perils by being a conduit to banks and other specialty lenders.\nIt also has a captive audience, providing its services at the point of sale, such as hardware stores.\nGoldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are among the main underwriting banks on GreenSky's IPO.
