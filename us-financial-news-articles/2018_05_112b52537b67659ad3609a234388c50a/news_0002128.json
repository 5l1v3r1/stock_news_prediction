California has chosen not to participate, LPL said.\n\"We take our compliance and risk management obligations seriously and will continue to dedicate resources to this important work moving forward,\" LPL said in a statement.\nUnder the settlement, customers who were sold unregistered securities since October 2006 will be offered the full amount they paid plus 3 percent interest.\nLPL also agreed to a full review to assess its compliance with state securities laws, regulators said.
