(OTCQB:TFVR) (the \"Company\"), d/b/a TeraForge, today is providing shareholders with a update on its Bitcoin Mining Operation and expansion strategy.\nRecently, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase bitcoin mining equipment to be installed at Colocation Guard ( www.ColocationGuard.com ) in Brooklyn, NY. Led by Mr. Donald D’Avanzo, Director of Datacenter Operations, approximately 20 Antminer S9 Bitcoin Mining units were installed and have been running for approximately three weeks.\nAfter successful Phase I implementation and operational execution of the initial mining units, the Company has invested in 20 additional S9 antminers plus 82 new L3 Litecoin antminers to improve the project hash rate. 32 new GPU mining rigs consisting of a total of 192 Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 cards will be brought online to diversify the portfolio of cryptocurrency altcoins mined. The new units will allow the Company to mine the top five most profitable GPU altcoins; Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Monero, ZCash, and Ubiq.\nAdditionally Teraforge is working closely with ColocationGuard executive leadership to secure one of only three available anchor tenant slots in a new state-of-the-art dedicated mining facility located within the Northeast, currently referred to internally as ‘Site 4’ for security purposes.\nJonathan Read, Chief Executive Officer of TimefireVR, d/b/a TeraForge, stated, “We are pleased with the successful implementation of our bitcoin mining strategy with Donald and his team at their first class, secure, facility in New York. The seamless integration in a relatively short amount of time has offered us the luxury of exploring further investment and expansion opportunities. This phase is to thoroughly test our integration and predictive systems before we enter into a much larger build out of our capacity. We look forward to getting all of our new mining equipment up and running allowing us to diversify into other cryptocurrencies.”\nThe Company terminated its letter of intent (‘LOI’) to make a strategic investment and acquire a license in Cryptogram, LLC.\nMr. Read continued, “After careful review, in the best interest of the Company’s future and its shareholders, the Company has decided to terminate its LOI with Cryprogram.
