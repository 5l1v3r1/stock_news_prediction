A lot of analysts are expecting strong earnings as oil rebounds, and that hasn’t really played out so much early this year,” said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. At 2:34 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.73 percent at 24,536.98 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.97 percent to 2,698.28.\nThe Nasdaq Composite added 0.97 percent to 7,337.66.\nWorries lingered that rising oil prices would perk up inflation. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to a two-week high and above the key 3 percent level on expectations of higher interest rates.\nIn stock trading, Google-owner Alphabet rose 2.9 percent, providing more lift than any other stock to the S&P 500. It was followed by Facebook, rising 1.93 percent.\nWalmart fell 3 percent after the retailer took a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion.\nWalt Disney dipped 2.13 percent, despite reporting a quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 158 new highs and 49 new lows.
