The remaining three were built in 2015 and 2016.\nRWE, which also operates one of the newer coal-fired plants, said it was displeased by the decisions, as they offer no compensation for the ban on coal and for the 3.2 billion euros ($3.8 billion) RWE said it invested in its newest plant at the request of the government.\n“We expect significant consequences for our activities”, the company said in a statement. “We will contemplate legal action if the law is implemented as currently proposed.”\nVattenfall subsidiary Nuon said it would abide to the law and would shut down its coal-fired plant, known as Hemweg-8, at the end of 2024.\nShutting the coal-fired plants should help the government achieve its goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 49 percent relative to the 1990 level by 2030.\nEmissions were 13 percent lower last year than in 1990.\nReporting by Bart Meijer, editing by Louise Heavens and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:42:24.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
