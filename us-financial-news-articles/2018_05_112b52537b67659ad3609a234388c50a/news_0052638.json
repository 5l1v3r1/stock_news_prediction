Rally concerns\nOPEC may decide to raise oil output as soon as June due to worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday.\nHowever, it is unclear which countries have the capacity to raise output and fill any supply gap other than Gulf oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia, the sources said.\n\"Only a few members have the capability to increase production, so implementation will be complicated,\" one OPEC source said.\nOPECs compliance with the output deal reached unprecedented levels in recent months, meaning it had cut well above target. Falling Venezuelan output due to an economic crisis has helped OPEC deliver a bigger cut than intended. show chapters 9:02 AM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 02:50\nSo far, OPEC had said it saw no need to ease output restrictions despite concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could undermine demand.\nThe rapid decline in oil inventories and worries about supplies after the U.S. decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with Iran, as well as Venezuelas collapsing output, were behind the change in OPEC's thinking.\nConcerns raised by the United States that oil prices were too high also made the exporting group start internal discussions, OPEC sources familiar with the matter have said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, whose country is a major oil producer but is not part of the supply-cutting pact, last month said OPEC had \"artificially\" boosted oil prices.
