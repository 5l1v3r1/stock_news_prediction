The privately-held company in February said it stopped promoting opioids to physicians after widespread criticism of the ways drugmakers market highly addictive painkillers.\nBondi said state attorneys general from New York, California and Massachusetts were preparing similar lawsuits.\nMassachusetts last week sent a letter to Purdue notifying the company of its intention to sue. A spokeswoman for the office did not say when that lawsuit would be filed.\nThe California and New York attorney general offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nStamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, in a statement, denied the accusations, saying its drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and accounted for only 2 percent of all opioid prescriptions.\n\"We are disappointed that after months of good faith negotiations working toward a meaningful resolution to help these states address the opioid crisis, this group of attorneys general have unilaterally decided to pursue a costly and protracted litigation process,\" Purdue said.\nOpioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, the last year for which data was available, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSeparate litigation involving at least 433 lawsuits by U.S. cities and counties were consolidated in a federal court in Cleveland, Ohio. The defendants include Purdue, J&J, Teva, Endo, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson.\nThe suits accused drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and the distributors of ignoring indications that the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses.\nU.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who is overseeing the consolidated litigation, has been pushing for a global settlement. He invited state attorneys general with cases not before him to participate in those talks.\nDespite filing separate lawsuits, the six attorneys general on Tuesday said they would continue to engage in settlement discussions with Purdue and other companies.\n\"You always want to settle and prevent a prolonged litigation,\" said Florida's Bondi. \"But we're sending a message that we're fully prepared to go to war.\" (Reporting by Tina Bellon Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Berkrot)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T10:06:20.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
