I’d rather state the facts. Our job is to state the facts.” Reporting by Prak Chan Thul; Additional reporting and writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Darren Schuettler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:44:53.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
