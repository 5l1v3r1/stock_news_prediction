While doing an inventory check, a university employee discovered that only 13 of 14 small samples of the material could be accounted for. The last documentation of the missing plutonium sample is from 2003 and 2004 when it was set to be disposed. However, it’s unclear if it was disposed.\n“Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,” Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, the university’s vice president of research, told the AP. “The radioactive source in question poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/07/us/university-lost-plutonium-trnd/index.html", "https://apnews.com/63df894fc6c94799b944f6bf00ff056f"], "published": "2018-05-08T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T03:44:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
