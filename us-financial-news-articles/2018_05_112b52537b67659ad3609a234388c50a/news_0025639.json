(NASDAQ:DOVA), a pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for rare diseases where there is a high unmet need, today reported its operating and financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights\nContinued build-out of commercial infrastructure in preparation of the anticipated U.S. launch in June of avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. A New Drug Application (NDA) for avatrombopag was accepted for filing and granted Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2017. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date is May 21, 2018.\nCompleted an underwritten public offering of 2,500,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $32.00 per share. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $74.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.\nEntered into an exclusive distribution agreement granting Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Industrial Development Co., Ltd., (Fosun Pharma Industrial), a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (Fosun Pharma, SHA: 600196 and HKG: 02196), the exclusive development and distribution rights of avatrombopag for CLD patients with thrombocytopenia in mainland China and Hong Kong. Fosun will also support the development of avatrombopag for expanded indications in these markets.\nBegan enrollment in a clinical trial in a broader population of adult patients with thrombocytopenia regardless of disease etiology undergoing surgery.\nPlan to submit a sNDA in the second half of 2018 for the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2018 for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).\nOn April 27 th , filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with CLD. The EMA has granted a Standard Review Assessment for this MAA.\nRepaid, in full, the secured promissory note that was issued to Eisai on March 31, 2016 of $31.1 million. The issuance of the note enabled the Company to finance payments due to Eisai under its transition services agreement for all costs incurred through December 31, 2017.\nRefinanced a portion of the Eisai note by entering into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) for $20.0 million on April 17, 2018. The loan matures on April 17, 2021 unless a specified revenue milestone is achieved in which case the maturity date will be extended to April 17, 2022.\nAppointed Mark W. Hahn as the company’s Chief Financial Officer.\n“The highlight of the first quarter was the continued build-out of our commercial infrastructure as we progress towards a near-term potential U.S. launch of avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD. As we await our PDUFA date of May 21, 2018, we are now focused on preparing for a June launch,” said Alex C. Sapir, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dova. “In addition, Dova strengthened its cash position in the quarter, which further prepares us for launch and allows us to continue our development work in additional thrombocytopenia indications.”\nFirst Quarter and Financial Results\nDova reported a net loss of $13.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $5.4 million for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $4.3 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 Phase 3 clinical trials in January 2017, partially offset by the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate avatrombopag in a broader population of patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing surgery regardless of disease etiology.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to building Dova’s commercial infrastructure to support the potential launch of avatrombopag, increased corporate infrastructure, and additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Dova had $126.9 million in cash compared to $94.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the completion of an underwritten public offering which closed in February 2018, partially offset by the repayment of the Eisai note of $31.1 million and operating expenses.\nCompany to Host Conference Call\nDova will host a conference call today, May 9, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results and recent operational highlights.
