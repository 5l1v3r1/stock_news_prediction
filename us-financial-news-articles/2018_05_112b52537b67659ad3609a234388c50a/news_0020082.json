It tried to do the same using an ICC April ruling in Curacao, but the orders were rejected on that island because of improper wording, sources said.\nConoco’s legal maneuvering temporarily retains assets - from oil inventories, to cargoes and facilities - and could give Conoco the ability to sell them.
