For now, all I can say is that it is important (for Italy) to keep the path of responsible macroeconomic and budgetary responsibility,” Dombrovskis added.\nOn Wednesday, Italy’s president gave little known law professor Giuseppe Conte a mandate to lead the first government made up of anti-establishment parties that have vowed to shake up the European Union.\nThe two groups - the 5-Star-Movement and the League - last week agreed to a government pact, promising to slash taxes, ramp up welfare spending, posing the biggest challenge to the bloc since Britain voted to leave it two years ago.\nThe European Commission warned on Wednesday that Italy’s financial stability was at risk from possible interest rate increases and political worries. The EU executive warned the incoming government it should continue trimming Italy’s heavy public debt.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:10:42.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
