Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside cash on hand to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore, if there is no further cash on hand to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from additional debt. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment, operations and non-operating expenses would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from cash on hand. Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP, such as expenses incurred in connection with property acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss), which is a performance measure under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.\nNOI is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, which is an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. Investors are also cautioned that NOI should only be used to assess our operational performance in periods in which we have not incurred or accrued any acquisition related expenses.\nWe believe that NOI is an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of the properties. We believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.\nTo facilitate understanding of this financial measure, the following is a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n8,425,000\n$\n(7,527,000)\nGeneral and administrative\n6,388,000\n7,863,000\nAcquisition related expenses\n(769,000)\n318,000\nDepreciation and amortization\n23,692,000\n29,822,000\nInterest expense\n15,242,000\n14,259,000\nImpairment of real estate investment\n—\n3,969,000\nLoss from unconsolidated entity\n1,077,000\n962,000\nForeign currency gain\n(1,796,000)\n(513,000)\nOther income, net\n(295,000)\n(33,000)\nIncome tax benefit\n(371,000)\n(213,000)\nNet operating income\n$\n51,593,000\n$\n48,907,000\nGRIFFIN-AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REIT III, INC.\nFFO AND MFFO RECONCILIATION\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, a non-GAAP measure, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of funds from operations is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure, and our management uses FFO to evaluate our performance over time. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on funds from operations approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines funds from operations as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment writedowns, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, which is the case if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. In addition, we believe it is appropriate to exclude impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions, which can change over time. Testing for an impairment of an asset is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis. If certain impairment indications exist in an asset, and if the asset's carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset, an impairment charge would be recognized. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property.\nHistorical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our performance to investors and to our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss).\nHowever, FFO and MFFO as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP that were put into effect and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed as operating expenses under GAAP. We believe these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that publicly registered, non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. We have used the proceeds raised in our initial offering to acquire properties, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, a merger or sale, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or another similar transaction) within five years after the completion of our offering stage, which is generally comparable to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Thus, we do not intend to continuously purchase assets and intend to have a limited life. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental performance measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes expensed acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that we consider more reflective of investing activities, as well as other non-operating items included in FFO, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes expensed acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines modified funds from operations as funds from operations further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to closer to an expected to be received cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect modified funds from operations on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income (loss) in calculating cash flows from operations and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, and we do not rely on another party to manage such risk. In as much as interest rate hedges will not be a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are based on market fluctuations and may not be directly related or attributable to our operations.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses (which include gains or losses on contingent consideration), amortization of above- and below-market leases, amortization of loan and closing costs, change in deferred rent, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and the adjustments of such items related to unconsolidated properties and noncontrolling interests. The other adjustments included in the IPA's Practice Guideline are not applicable to us for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside cash on hand to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. However, we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows, nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there is no further cash on hand to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from additional debt. Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP, such as expenses incurred in connection with property acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss), which is a performance measure under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the future, we may pay acquisition fees or reimburse acquisition expenses due to our advisor and its affiliates, or a portion thereof, with net proceeds from borrowed funds, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds from borrowings available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from cash on hand.\nFurther, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income (loss) in determining cash flows from operations. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence, that the use of such measures may be useful to investors. For example, acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of our initial offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate funds from operations and modified funds from operations the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, which is an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO and MFFO.\nNeither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and MFFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n8,425,000\n$\n(7,527,000)\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization — consolidated properties\n23,692,000\n29,822,000\nDepreciation and amortization — unconsolidated properties\n288,000\n264,000\nImpairment of real estate investment\n—\n3,969,000\nLoss on disposition of real estate investment\n—\n227,000\nNet (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests\n(272,000)\n4,008,000\nLess:\nDepreciation, amortization, impairment and loss on disposition related to redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests\n(3,815,000)\n(7,018,000)\nFFO attributable to controlling interest\n$\n28,318,000\n$\n23,745,000\nAcquisition related expenses(1)\n$\n(769,000)\n$\n318,000\nAmortization of above- and below-market leases(2)\n199,000\n169,000\nAmortization of loan and closing costs(3)\n59,000\n53,000\nChange in deferred rent(4)\n(1,068,000)\n(1,341,000)\nGain in fair value of derivative financial instruments(5)\n(110,000)\n(336,000)\nForeign currency gain(6)\n(1,796,000)\n(513,000)\nAdjustments for unconsolidated properties(7)\n439,000\n478,000\nAdjustments for redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests(7)\n(401,000)\n(110,000)\nMFFO attributable to controlling interest\n$\n24,871,000\n$\n22,463,000\nWeighted average common shares outstanding — basic and diluted\n200,347,084\n196,897,807\nNet income (loss) per common share — basic and diluted\n$\n0.04\n$\n(0.04)\nFFO attributable to controlling interest per common share — basic and diluted\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.12\nMFFO attributable to controlling interest per common share — basic and diluted\n$\n0.12\n$\n0.11", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:59:20.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
