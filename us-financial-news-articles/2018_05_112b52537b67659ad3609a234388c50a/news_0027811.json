So far we’ve had energy.” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.\n“If the kind of gains we saw yesterday holds over, people will move into the market.”\nAt 11:16 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 189.72 points, or 0.77 percent, at 24,732.26.\nThe S&P 500 was up 18.01 points, or 0.67 percent, at 2,715.80 and breached its 100-day moving average, a key technical level. The Nasdaq Composite was up 51.67 points, or 0.70 percent, at 7,391.58.\nThe S&P technology index rose 0.9 percent, led by Apple, Facebook and Alphabet.\nQualcomm rose 2.6 percent after the chipmaker approved a new $10 billion share buyback program.\nNvidia, which is set to report earnings after the closing bell, was up 1.1 percent.\nWells Fargo rose 0.8 percent after the lender said it expects efficiency efforts to cut expenses by $2 billion annually in 2018 and 2019.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.39-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.69-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 30 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 113 new highs and 18 new lows.
