For the whole year, total payouts amounted to 815 cents per share, compared with 830 cents in the previous year.\nMTN Group, Vodacom’s nearest rival, cut its 2018 dividend by about 30 percent in March, but adopted a “progressive” dividend policy, saying it would use this year’s figure as a base to increase payouts by 10 to 20 percent in the next three to five years.
