But for me it’s important to play matches to test myself playing against the top guys.\n“It’s positive to see that the knee was doing okay, but now I need a lot of time to work on my fitness. Today was tough but I’m really happy to see where I am right now.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T22:24:29.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
