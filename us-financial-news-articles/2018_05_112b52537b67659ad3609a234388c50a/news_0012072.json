Still, Amazon said it would investigate the incident and that this driver would no longer make deliveries.\n“This is inexcusable and does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners,” a spokesperson for the company told CNBC in an emailed statement. “We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages for the independent delivery service provider.”\nIt’s incidents like this that lead to concerns over Amazon’s plan to deliver products directly into their customers’ homes with Amazon Key — a service the company’s vice president of delivery technology, Peter Larsen, called “a core part of the Amazon shopping experience from this point forward.”\n“I just want people to know this can happen,” Wilma’s owner Guttfield said. “Our homes are all exposed to these drivers and the vast majority of them are great. But low lives will take advantage.”\nHe stressed that “It’s just a miracle I got Wilma back.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T00:03:30.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
