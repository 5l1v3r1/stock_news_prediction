The Iraqi air force has carried out several air strikes since last year against Islamic State positions in Syrian territory.\nAbadi declared final victory last December over the ultra hardline group who overran a third of Iraq in 2014.\nBut the militants still pose a threat along the border with Syria and have continued to carry out ambushes, killings and bombings across Iraq.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T10:25:46.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
