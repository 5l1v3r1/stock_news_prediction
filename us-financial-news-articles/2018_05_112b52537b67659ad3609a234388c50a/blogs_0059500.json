Nevertheless, it also should be a time of action.\nMay 30, 2018\n\"If you weren't already organized with your finances, being suddenly unemployed is really the time to get organized,\" said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. \"It's reactive, but important.\n\"The emphasis is going to be on finding new employment and you don't want to be distracted.\"\nHere are some tips for those who find themselves unexpectedly without a job.\nLook into unemployment insurance First up is seeing if you are eligible to collect unemployment benefits . While the specifics of each state's program differs, workers who qualify for a weekly unemployment check can generally get help for up to 26 weeks.\nThis can be trickier for gig workers or contractors, due to various requirements imposed by your state.

A law known as COBRA allows qualifying workers to keep their group coverage when they leave the job, assuming the employer is subject to the law (smaller firms and certain other employers are exempt).\nHowever, you'll be responsible for paying the full premium. Under COBRA, you generally can keep the group coverage for up to 18 months.\n\"This is a time to really analyze what expenses are absolutely necessary and then pull back on your discretionary expenses.\" -Douglas Boneparth, President of Bone Fide Wealth in New York Alternatively, you can look for a health plan on the open marketplace that could be cheaper.\nIf you want to keep your group policy, contact your company's human resources department for guidance.\nStay on top of debt Even when you face a drop in income, you're still expected to continue paying your bills, including your debt. If you anticipate trouble staying on top of those payments, contact your creditors to see if there are options for reducing your monthly payments.\nDebt, whether in the form of credit cards or student loans , can spiral out of control if you don't stay on top of it.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nIf you're looking for the next hot job, expect to do this for free\nIn the post-Harvey Weinstein era, here's how to report workplace abuse\nThese mistakes can ruin your dream vacation.

That's on top of paying ordinary income taxes on any money withdrawn.\nWhile many 401(k) plans allow workers to take a loan from their account, that option generally disappears when you leave the company.\nFocus on job huting The goal in between all of this is to find new employment.
