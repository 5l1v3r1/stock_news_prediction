He is a meticulous professional and is prepared to challenge people.\n“Now is a moment in his life where he is prepared to bring that into the team environment.”\nKane, who first captained England in a World Cup qualifier against Scotland last year, said it was a “massive honor”.\n“I’m very excited for the World Cup, can’t wait,” he said. “Leading the lads out is going to be special.”\nEngland face Tunisia, Panama and Belgium at the World Cup in which they will send their third-youngest squad to a major tournament, with an average age of 26.\nHe will have some experience around him, however, such as Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson and Chelsea’s Gary Cahill\n“Harry will need the support of the other good leaders we’ve got around him,” Southgate said.\n“You don’t become a top team by just having a good captain with good values. That has to spread right throughout the group but I think he’s the one ready to take that challenge on.”\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:56:56.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
