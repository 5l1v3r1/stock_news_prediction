Penney store in New York, U.S. Photo: AP\nJ.C. Penney Co. Inc., which blamed unseasonable weather for anemic sales last quarter, aims to reduce inventory, which rose 2.6% on a same-store basis, said Jeffrey Davis, finance chief of the retail chain.\nThe Texas-based company hired Amy Wooden in February to the role of senior vice president of planning and allocation and pricing to aid in that effort.\n“As it relates to the inventory, we do believe that we have an ongoing opportunity to…reduce our inventory levels,” Mr. Davis said in a conference call Thursday. “We have not provided any guidance as to what that amount would be over the course of the year.”\nMr. Davis said inventory at the end of the company’s fiscal first quarter was about $2.9 billion, down 1.4% compared to the same period last year, but up 2.6% on a comparable store basis. The retailer defines comparable store sales as sales, including sales made from services and commissions earned on in-store licensed departments, from all stores that have been open for 12 consecutive full fiscal months and online sales.\n“The increase in comp inventory is primarily related to floor samples associated with additional appliance and mattress showrooms and the expansion of extended sizes in Active’s assortment,” Mr. Davis said.\nSame-store sales for the three-month period ended May 5 rose by just 0.2% compared to the 2.1% analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected.\nMs. Wooden, who will report to Mr. Davis, oversees pricing and markdown strategies, product availability and limiting inventory, according to a company press release. Before joining JCPenney, Ms. Wooden served in a similar role at department-store chain Belk Inc. J.C. Penney declined further comment on her appointment and the quarterly results.\n“They have to make an aggressive move to manage the inventory,” said Michael Unger, a principal in the strategy and operations division of consulting firm The Hackett Group. “There are some things you can’t help, including weather and competing against stores that are liquidating,” he added.\nMr. Unger said that someone in Ms. Wooden’s position likely has information on the inventory of individual stores, let alone regions. The job of managing inventory has become more difficult, he added, as stores have had to carry larger sizes while at the same time facing competition from online outlets like Amazon.com Inc.\n“It’s becoming increasingly more complicated in retail,” he said. “What we are seeing is seasonality is increasing, fashion is becoming more and more fast moving and having a shorter life cycle.”\nFor the quarter, J.C. Penney reported total revenue slipped 4.1% to $2.67 billion. The company posted a net loss of $78 million for the period, compared to a loss of $187 million during the same period last year.\nShare this: EARNINGS INVENTORY MANAGEMENT Previous Covestro Wants To Make A Deal, But Lacks An Obvious Target Next CFO Moves: United, Blue Apron, Ferrari, Dunelm ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T21:58:29.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
