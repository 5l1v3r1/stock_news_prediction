(NYSE: SQNS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nRevenue: Revenue was $11.2 million, flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 9.6% compared to the first quarter of 2017, reflecting a decrease in broadband product revenue partially offset by an increase in other revenue. IoT related revenue was up significantly, both sequentially and compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nGross margin: Gross margin was 41.7% in both the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 47.1% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a shift in product mix toward a lower proportion of chips.\nOperating loss: Operating loss was $7.3 million compared to an operating loss of $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an operating loss of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss: Net loss was $8.7 million, or ($0.10) per diluted share/ADS, compared to a net loss $7.6 million, or ($0.10) per diluted share/ADS, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $5.6 million, or ($0.07) per diluted share/ADS, in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-IFRS Net loss: Excluding the non-cash items of stock-based compensation, the non-cash impact of convertible debt amendments and effective interest adjustments related to the convertible debt and other financings, non-IFRS net loss was $7.5 million, or ($0.08) per diluted share/ADS, compared to a non-IFRS net loss of $5.9 million, or ($0.07) per diluted share/ADS in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a non-IFRS net loss of $4.7 million, or ($0.06) per diluted share/ADS, in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposit at March 31, 2018 totaled $15 million compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nIn millions of US$ except percentages, shares and per share amounts Key Metrics Q1 2018 %* Q4 2017 %* Q1 2017 %* Revenue $11.2 $11.3 $12.4 Gross profit 4.7 41.7 % 4.7 41.7 % 5.9 47.1 % Operating loss (7.3 ) (64.9 )% (5.6 ) (49.7 )% (4.2 ) (34.2 )% Net loss (8.7 ) (77.9 )% (7.6 ) (67.6 )% (5.6 ) (45.1 )% Diluted EPS ($0.10 ) ($0.10 ) ($0.07 ) Weighted average number of diluted shares/ADS 91,465,178 79,844,151 75,043,865 Cash flow from (used in) operations (6.0 ) (9.3 ) (9.9 ) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposit at quarter-end 15.0 3.3 14.5 Additional information on non-cash items: - Stock-based compensation included in operating result 0.5 0.7 0.3 - Non-cash impact of Convertible debt amendments — 0.3 — - Change in the fair value of convertible debt embedded derivative — — — - Non-cash interest on convertible debt and other financing 0.7 0.7 0.6 Non-IFRS diluted EPS (excludes stock-based compensation, impact of convertible debt amendments and effective interest adjustments related to the convertible and other debt and embedded derivative,and the non-cash impact of revaluation of interest-free government loan) ($0.08 ) ($0.07 ) ($0.06 ) * Percentage of revenue\n\"Our IoT business continued to gain momentum during the first quarter, with IoT revenue increasing more than 50% from Q4, driven by strong Cat 1 growth,\" said Georges Karam, Sequans' CEO. \"The strength in IoT mostly offset the expected weakness of broadband business in Q1, and we believe broadband will pick up gradually during the balance of the year. We are continuing to gain traction with our Monarch Cat M1/NB1 solution and derivative products for a growing list of IoT devices and look forward to seeing several of them launch during the second half of the year. This IoT momentum, together with new opportunities in our broadband business, plus our expanding customer relationships in vertical markets, supports our confidence in further acceleration of our long-term growth.\"\nQ2 2018 Outlook\nThe following statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Sequans undertakes no obligation to update these statements.\nSequans expects revenue for the second quarter of 2018 to be in the range of $12.5 to $14.5 million, with non-IFRS gross margin above 40%. Based on this revenue range and expected gross margin, non-IFRS net loss per diluted share/ADS is expected to be between ($0.07) and ($0.08) for the second quarter of 2018, based on approximately 94.5 million weighted average number of diluted shares/ADSs. Non-IFRS EPS guidance excludes the impact of stock based compensation, the non-cash fair-value and effective interest adjustments related to the convertible debt and other financings, and any other relevant non-cash or non-recurring expenses.\nConference Call and Webcast\nSequans plans to conduct a teleconference and live webcast to discuss the financial results for the first quarter of 2018 today, May 2, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. EDT /14:00 CET.

All statements other than present and historical facts and conditions contained in this release, including any statements regarding our future results of operations and financial positions, business strategy, anticipation for IoT and broadband sales, plans and our objectives for future operations and potential strategic partnerships, are (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). These statements are only predictions and reflect our current beliefs and expectations with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risk and uncertainties and subject to change at any time. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these . Actual events or results may those contained in the projections or . Some of the factors that could cause actual results to the contained herein include, without limitation: (i) the contraction or lack of growth of markets in which we compete and in which our products are sold, (ii) unexpected increases in our expenses, including manufacturing expenses, (iii) our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall, (iv) delays or cancellations in spending by our customers, (v) unexpected average selling price reductions, (vi) the significant fluctuation to which our quarterly revenue and operating results are subject due to cyclicality in the wireless communications industry and transitions to new process technologies, (vii) our inability to anticipate the future market demands and future needs of our customers, (viii) our inability to achieve new design wins or for design wins to result in shipments of our products at levels and in the timeframes we currently expect, (ix) our inability to enter into and execute on strategic alliances, (x) the impact of natural disasters on our sourcing operations and supply chain, and (xi) other factors detailed in documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nUse of Non-IFRS/non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, we disclose certain non-IFRS, or non-GAAP, financial measures. These measures exclude non-cash charges relating to stock-based compensation and the non-cash financial income and expense related to the convertible debt and its embedded derivative issued in April 2015 and April 2016. We believe that these measures can be useful to facilitate comparisons among different companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations in that the non-GAAP measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures in the table attached to this press release. We are not able to provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for forward-looking IFRS estimates for gross margin and net loss per diluted share without unreasonable efforts, because certain adjustments are not known until the end of the period. The impact of these adjustments could be significant to our actual IFRS results.\nAbout Sequans Communications\nSequans Communications S.A.
