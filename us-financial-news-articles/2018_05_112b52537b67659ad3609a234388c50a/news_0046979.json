REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo “The government’s position is very clear, it doesn’t want the plant to run,” said Sandeep Nanduri, the top official of the district where the plant is located, after a meeting with senior state government officials.\nOther state officials confirmed the decision.\nEarlier, authorities cut the power to the smelter. The pollution control board of Tamil Nadu said the smelter, which was shut pending renewal of its operating license, was found last week to be preparing to resume production without permission.\nReporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Writing by Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by Martin Howell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:25:45.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
