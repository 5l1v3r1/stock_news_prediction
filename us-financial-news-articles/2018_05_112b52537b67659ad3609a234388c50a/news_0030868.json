It raised its ordinary dividend to at least 250 million pounds ($338.8 million) per annum from 2019, up from at least 150 million pounds earlier.\nTaylor Wimpey also said it would pay a special dividend of 350 million pounds in 2019.\nThe company said its new five-year goals included an increase of return on net operating assets to 35 percent, up from its 2016-2018 target of 30 percent, and maintained its operating profit margin target of 21-22 percent.\nShares of Taylor Wimpey were up 2.6 percent at 200 pence by 0807 GMT.
