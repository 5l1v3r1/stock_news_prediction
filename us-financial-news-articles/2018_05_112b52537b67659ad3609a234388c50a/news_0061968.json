Victoria Jones/Pool via REUTERS “It’s not our direct responsibility,” Carney said when asked about tariffs on Thursday during a panel discussion at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the G7 group of rich nations in Whistler, Canada.\n“But the bigger context we would put this in is to say that this focus on goods trade, bilateral goods is not the right focus in a hyperconnected world where most of the economic activity, most people work, most small businesses, most women, work in the service sector,” he said.\nBritain’s government criticised the new U.S. tariffs earlier on Thursday.\nReporting by David Milliken; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-06-01T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:01:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
