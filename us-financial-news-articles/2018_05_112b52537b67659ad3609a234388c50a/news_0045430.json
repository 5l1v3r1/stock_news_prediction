FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Watford - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - March 17, 2018 Liverpool's Emre Can with Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp as he goes off injured REUTERS/Phil Noble\nCan trained with the Liverpool squad on Monday and his return to fitness is a boost for Klopp whose midfield options have been restricted by injury to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\nBut Klopp cautioned about Can’s potential involvement in the game in Kiev.\n“It depends always on the reaction. But let me put it this way, 10 days ago I didn’t think it is possible he could do what he did today. It looked good. It was really positive but we have to wait,” he told reporters.\n“The door is open - he is really desperate to be a part. We shall see,” Klopp added.\nJames Milner, who missed the final Premier League game of the season against Brighton & Hove Albion with a muscle problem, also took part in the training session.
