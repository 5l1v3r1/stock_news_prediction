And philanthropist Melinda Gates says there is a simple and subtle way you can get the credit and authority you deserve: Keep your supporters close.\nSurrounding yourself with people who validate and encourage you can help co-workers, managers and outsiders take you more seriously, says Gates, who recently started investing in female-led and minority-focused venture capital firms.\nAnyone who wants to be taken seriously \"needs to surround herself with people who have her back, who know she is the leader â€” man or woman,\" Gates tells Fortune in an interview published Wednesday. Then, when a person who has your back is asked a question that should have been directed at you, they can redirect by saying, \"'Jane actually knows the answer to that.
