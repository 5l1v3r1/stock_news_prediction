Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday, “I’d love to own 100 percent of it.”\n“Buffet took such an outsized position in Apple, which was reassuring to a lot of people,” said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. “Psychologically, people went into last week a little skeptical, but I think we saw a thawing of that late last week and over the weekend.”\nThe S&P energy index surged 1.5 percent, the strongest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors, as crude prices rose due to troubles for Venezuelan oil company PDVSA and a looming decision on whether the United States will re-impose sanctions on Iran.\nWorries over inflation and interest rates, along with tariff and geopolitical tensions, have overshadowed a solid earnings season, which is on track to record its best quarter in seven years.\nNearly 80 percent of the 417 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is well above the long-term average of 64 percent and the average of 75 percent over the past four quarters.\nThree quarters of companies have reported revenue above expectations, compared to 60 percent in a typical quarter. That suggests that companies are growing their businesses, and not solely benefiting from deep corporate tax cuts introduced this year.\nAt 2:42 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.69 percent at 24,429.52, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.67 percent to 2,681.17.\nThe Nasdaq Composite added 1.04 percent to 7,284.93.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the technology index rising 1.13 percent.\nAthenaHealth jumped 15 percent after hedge fund Elliott Management proposed an all-cash offer that would value the healthcare IT company at about $6.5 billion.\nUtilities, consumer staples and telecoms were all down.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.32-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 117 new highs and 18 new lows.
