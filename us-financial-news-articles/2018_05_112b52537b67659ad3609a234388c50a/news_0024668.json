Demonstrators march in a public sector workers protest, organised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), as part of its ‘A New Deal for Working People’ campaign, in central London, Britain May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nThe Trades Union Congress used the march to call for a higher minimum wage, improved job security and investment in public services as it released research saying that wages were still worth less in real terms than before the financial crisis.\n“This demonstration today is about workers rights, it is about collective endeavour but above all, it’s a declaration that we’re around to campaign as long as it takes, to bring about that social justice and that decency in society,” Corbyn told the rally.\nThe TUC said real wages were not forecast to return to their pre-financial crash levels until 2025. It said that would mark the worst period of wage stagnation for two centuries.
