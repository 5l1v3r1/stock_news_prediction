And so you give it everything on an out-lap and you still don’t have your tyres in the (performance) window.\n“This year they’re just too hard. That’s why everyone struggles. I don’t understand why they worked in Australia and haven’t worked ever since and today we have them working.” (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-13T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:11:03.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
