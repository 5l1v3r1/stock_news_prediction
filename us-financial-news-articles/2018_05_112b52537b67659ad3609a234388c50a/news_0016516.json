Residents of a second area, Lanipuna Gardens, were barred from returning home on Monday due to deadly volcanic gases.\nLeilani Estates, some 12 miles from the volcano, was evacuated due to the risk of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be life-threatening at high levels.\n\"Please, the residents of Leilani need our help. This is not the time for sightseeing. You can help tremendously by staying out of the area,\" the agency said.\nKilauea, which began exploding on Thursday with fountains and rivers of lava flowing into neighborhoods, has opened 10 volcanic vents since then, officials said.

So far, no deaths or major injuries have been reported, but the civil defense agency said at least 35 structures had been destroyed, many of them homes.\nThe southeast corner of the island was rocked by a powerful magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the volcano's south flank on Friday, the strongest tremor since 1975, and more earthquakes and eruptions have been forecast, perhaps for months to come.\nKilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes and one of five on the island, has been in constant eruption for 35 years. It predominantly blows off basaltic lava in effusive eruptions that flow into the ocean but occasionally experiences more explosive events.\n\"It's been a bit of a chaotic week, a very stressful situation. It's one of those hopeless, helpless outlooks. It's hard to explain but the lava is right behind my house and it's pretty surreal,\" Leilani Estates homeowner Jared McManus told Reuters.\nThe Hawaii Star-Advertiser newspaper reported that a Hawaii-based utility, Puna Geothermal Venture, had 60,000 gallons (227,124 liters) of flammable pentane gas stored in the area that could not be removed until containers were delivered.\nSome area residents returned for pets, medications and to check property on Sunday and Monday.
