Wallace will face vulnerable Republican incumbent Representative Brian Fitzpatrick.\nDemocrats are also expected to win three contests in districts in suburban Philadelphia that have been redrawn to favor them.\nMadeleine Dean, a state representative, Air Force veteran Chrissy Houlahan and lawyer Mary Gay Scanlon won the nomination in their respective districts. Currently, there are no women representing Pennsylvania in the House.\nPennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil this year when the state Supreme Court found that its congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans. The redrawn map has made some districts more competitive.\nIn addition, six incumbent House Republicans are not running for re-election, further scrambling the races and requiring voters to become familiar with a raft of first-time candidates.\nAs for the Senate, U.S. Representative Lou Barletta won the Republican nomination to battle incumbent Democrat Bob Casey in the fall. Barletta was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential bid and has fervently embraced the president’s policies.\nDemocrats must hold Casey’s Senate seat and those of other incumbents and pick up two currently held by Republicans to seize control of that chamber.\nBeyond Pennsylvania, Democratic hopes of taking a Nebraska House seat might have been dealt a blow after progressive Kara Eastman won a primary race against former congressman Brad Ashford, who was backed by the national party.\nEastman, who centered her campaign around establishing a national single-payer health-care system, will face incumbent Republican Don Bacon this fall to represent an Omaha-area district that is viewed as perhaps too moderate for a candidate such as her.
