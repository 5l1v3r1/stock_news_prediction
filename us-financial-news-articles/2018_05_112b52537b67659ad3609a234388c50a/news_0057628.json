On top of helping customers from all sectors navigate and optimise their cloud-powered transition, ICG will focus on providing its cloud adoption advisory services and various solutions especially security to the FSI as well as to HKBN's over 55,000 existing corporate customers.\"\nICG CEO Eric Leung added, \"We are honored to become Co-Owners of HKBN.
