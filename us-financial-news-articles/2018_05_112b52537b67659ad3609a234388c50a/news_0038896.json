Noe’s team told him to expect his toughest press reaction yet.\n“My publicist announced me it was going to be much harder with this movie than with ‘Love’ or ‘Enter the Void’,” Noe told Reuters on the beach at Cannes.\n“We had 75 percent bad press on ‘Enter the Void’ and 85 percent bad press on ‘Love’. I (said I) hope we get 90-95 percent (on ‘Climax’), but the wind turned the other way, most of the press is extremely good.”\nThe movie’s premise is simple. A troupe of young dancers are enjoying a post-rehearsal party which starts to get nasty when they realise someone has spiked the punch with LSD. 71st Cannes Film Festival - Screening of the film \"BlacKkKlansman\" in competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France May 14, 2018.

Variety’s Owen Gleiberman said it was “like watching ‘Fame’ directed by the Marquis de Sade with a Steadicam”.\nRating the film A-, IndieWire critic Eric Cohn said: “Noe’s remarkable psychedelic ride is his most focused achievement, a concise package of sizzling dance sequences and jolting developments that play like a slick mashup of the ‘Step Up’ franchise and ‘Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom’”. 71st Cannes Film Festival - Screening of the film \"BlacKkKlansman\" in competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France May 14, 2018.

The festival runs to May 19.
