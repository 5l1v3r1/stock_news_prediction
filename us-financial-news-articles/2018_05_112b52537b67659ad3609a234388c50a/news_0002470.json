We originated $320 million in gross investments at an average cap rate of 7.8%. We also profitably divested $45 million of real estate, resulting in net acquisition activity for the quarter of $275 million, and our investment yields continued to be highly accretive. Importantly, we completed our inaugural public unsecured note offering, which was rated BBB/BBB/Baa2 by Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s, respectively. Our dividend continues to be well-protected, with an AFFO payout ratio of 70%. Together, our reinvested free cash flows and average annual rent increases of 1.8% combine to deliver internal growth that will drive most of our anticipated total growth for 2018. With strong and stable portfolio performance, we are affirming our guidance for the year.”\nFinancial Results\nTotal Revenues\nTotal revenues were $125.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 16.6% from $108.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was driven primarily by the growth in the size of STORE Capital’s real estate investment portfolio, which grew from $5.5 billion in gross investment amount representing 1,750 property locations and 369 customers at March 31, 2017 to $6.5 billion in gross investment amount representing 2,000 property locations and 404 customers at March 31, 2018.\nNet Income\nNet income was $50.0 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, an increase from $31.4 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 includes an aggregate net gain on dispositions of real estate of $9.6 million as compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2017.\nNet income includes such items as gain or loss on dispositions of real estate and provisions for impairment. These items can vary from quarter to quarter and impact net income and period-to-period comparisons.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)\nAFFO increased 22.8% to $85.9 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to AFFO of $70.0 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in AFFO between years was primarily driven by additional rental revenues and interest income generated by the growth in the Company’s real estate investment portfolio.\nDividend Information\nAs previously announced, STORE Capital declared a regular quarterly cash dividend per common share of $0.31 for the first 2018. This dividend, totaling $61.4 million, was paid on April 16, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 30, 2018.\nReal Estate Portfolio Highlights\nInvestment Activity\nThe Company originated $320.4 million of gross investments representing 103 property locations during the first quarter of 2018, adding seven new customers. These investments had a weighted average initial cap rate of 7.8%. The Company defines “initial cap rate” for property acquisitions as the initial annual cash rent divided by the purchase price of the property.\nDisposition Activity\nDuring the 2018, the Company sold 22 properties and recognized an aggregate net gain on the dispositions of real estate of $9.6 million. For the 2018, proceeds from the dispositions of real estate aggregated $49.8 million as compared to an aggregate original investment amount of $45.5 million for the properties sold.\nPortfolio\nAt March 31, 2018, STORE Capital’s real estate portfolio totaled $6.5 billion representing 2,000 property locations. Approximately 95% of the portfolio represents commercial real estate properties subject to long-term leases, 4% represents mortgage loans and direct financing receivables primarily on commercial real estate buildings (located on land the Company owns and leases to its customers) and a nominal amount represents loans receivable secured by the tenants’ other assets. As of March 31, 2018, the portfolio’s annualized base rent and interest (based on rates in effect on March 31, 2018 for all lease and loan contracts) totaled $520.2 million as compared to $447.6 million as of March 31, 2017. The weighted average non-cancelable remaining term of the leases at March 31, 2018 was approximately 14 years.\nThe Company's portfolio of real estate investments is highly diversified across customers, brand names or business concepts, industries and geography. The following table presents a summary of the Company’s portfolio.\nPortfolio At A Glance - As of March 31, 2018 Investment property locations 2,000 States 49 Customers 404 Industries in which customers operate 104 Proportion of portfolio from direct origination ~80% Contracts with STORE-preferred terms * (1) 93% Weighted average annual lease escalation (2) 1.8% Weighted average remaining lease contract term ~14 years Occupancy (3) 99.6% Properties not operating but subject to a lease (4) 20 Investment locations subject to a ground lease 20 Investment portfolio subject to NNN leases * 98% Investment portfolio subject to Master Leases * (5) 87% Average investment amount/replacement cost (new) (6) 82% Locations subject to unit-level financial reporting 97% Median unit fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR)/4-Wall coverage ratio (7) 2.1x/2.6x Contracts rated investment grade (8) ~75% * Based on annualized base rent and interest.\n(1) Represents the percentage of our lease contracts that were created by STORE or contain preferred contract terms such as unit-level financial reporting, triple-net lease provisions and, when applicable, master lease provisions. (2) Represents the weighted average annual escalation rate of the entire portfolio as if all escalations occurred annually. For escalations based on a formula including CPI, assumes the stated fixed percentage in the contract or assumes 1.5% if no fixed percentage is in the contract. For contracts with no escalations remaining in the current lease term, assumes the escalation in the extension term. Calculation excludes contracts representing less than 0.2% of annualized base rent and interest where there are no further escalations remaining in the current lease term and there are no extension options. (3) The Company defines occupancy as a property being subject to a lease or loan contract. As of March 31, 2018, seven of the Company’s properties were vacant and not subject to a contract. (4) Represents the number of the Company’s investment locations that have been closed by the tenant but remain subject to a lease. (5) Percentage of investment portfolio in multiple properties with a single customer subject to master leases. Approximately 83% of the investment portfolio involves multiple properties with a single customer, whether or not subject to a master lease. (6) Represents the ratio of purchase price to replacement cost (new) at acquisition. (7) STORE Capital calculates a unit’s FCCR generally as the ratio of (i) the unit’s EBITDAR, less a standardized corporate overhead expense based on estimated industry standards, to (ii) the unit’s total fixed charges, which are its lease expense, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on indebtedness. The 4-Wall coverage ratio refers to a unit’s FCCR before taking into account standardized corporate overhead expense. (8) Represents the percentage of the Company’s contracts that have a STORE Score that is investment grade. The Company measures the credit quality of its portfolio on a contract-by-contract basis using the STORE Score, which is a proprietary risk measure reflective of both the credit risk of the Company’s tenants and the profitability of the operations at the properties. As of March 31, 2018, STORE Capital’s tenants had a median tenant credit profile of approximately ‘Ba2’ as measured by Moody's Analytics RiskCalc rating scale. Considering the profitability of the operations at each of its properties and STORE’s assessment of the likelihood that each of the tenants will choose to continue to operate at the properties in the event of their insolvency, the credit quality of its contracts, or STORE Score, is enhanced to a median of ‘Baa2’. Capital Transactions\nIn February 2018, the Company expanded its unsecured revolving credit facility from $500 million to $600 million and the accordion feature from $300 million to $800 million for a total maximum borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion. The amended credit facility matures in February 2022 and includes two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions.\nIn February 2018, the Company established a new $500 million “at the market” equity distribution program, or ATM program, and terminated its previous $400 million ATM Program established in September 2016. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold an aggregate of approximately 4.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $24.51 and raised approximately $99.0 million in net proceeds after the payment of sales agents’ commissions and offering expenses.\nIn March 2018, the Company completed its first public debt offering, issuing $350 million in aggregate principal amount of its unsecured, investment-grade rated 4.50% Senior Notes, due March 2028. The net proceeds from the issuance were primarily used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Company’s credit facility.\n2018 Guidance\nAffirming its 2018 guidance initially presented in November 2017, the Company currently expects 2018 AFFO per share to be within a range of $1.78 to $1.84, based on projected 2018 annual real estate acquisition volume, net of projected property sales, of approximately $900 million. This AFFO per share guidance equates to anticipated net income, excluding gains or losses on sales of property, of $0.83 to $0.87 per share, plus $0.88 to $0.90 per share of expected real estate depreciation and amortization, plus approximately $0.07 per share related to such items as straight-line rent and the amortization of stock-based compensation and deferred financing costs. AFFO per share is sensitive to the timing and amount of real estate acquisitions, property dispositions and capital markets activities during the year, as well as to the spread achieved between the lease rates on new acquisitions and the interest rates on borrowings used to finance those acquisitions. The midpoint of our AFFO guidance is based on a weighted average cap rate on new acquisitions of 7.75% and target leverage in the range of 5½ to 6 times run-rate net debt to EBITDA.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held later today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time / 9:00 a.m. Scottsdale, Arizona Time, to discuss first 2018 operating results and answer questions.\nLive conference call: 855-656-0920 (domestic) or 412-542-4168 (international) Conference call replay available through May 17, 2018: 877-344-7529 (domestic) or 412-317-0088 (international) Replay access code: 10118694 Live and archived webcast: http://ir.storecapital.com/webcasts\nAbout STORE Capital\nSTORE Capital Corporation is an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is the leader in the acquisition, investment and management of Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, which is its target market and the inspiration for its name. STORE Capital is one of the largest and fastest growing net-lease REITs and owns a large, well-diversified portfolio that consists of investments in 2,000 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers, in 49 states. Additional information about STORE Capital can be found on its website at www.storecapital.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts contain within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” “approximate” or “plan,” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to those expressed in the . For more information on risk factors for STORE Capital’s business, please refer to the periodic reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. These herein speak only as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events. STORE Capital expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any contained herein, to reflect any change in STORE Capital’s expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFFO and AFFO\nSTORE Capital’s reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The Company also discloses Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes these two non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations as reported on a statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income, excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciable property, real estate impairment losses, and depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nTo derive AFFO, the Company modifies the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash revenues and expenses that have no impact on the Company’s long-term operating performance, such as straight-line rents, amortization of deferred financing costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, in deriving AFFO, the Company excludes certain other costs not related to its ongoing operations, such as the amortization of lease-related intangibles.\nFFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among the Company’s peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. Management believes that AFFO provides more useful information to investors and analysts because it modifies FFO to exclude certain additional non-cash revenues and expenses such as straight-line rents and the amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation and lease-related intangibles as such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on long-term operating performance. The Company believes that these costs are not an ongoing cost of the portfolio in place at the end of each reporting period and, for these reasons, the portion expensed is added back when computing AFFO. As a result, the Company believes AFFO to be a more meaningful measurement of ongoing performance that allows for greater performance comparability. Therefore, the Company discloses both FFO and AFFO and reconciles them to the most appropriate GAAP performance metric, which is net income. STORE Capital’s FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nSTORE Capital Corporation\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018 2017 (unaudited) Revenues: Rental revenues $ 119,900 $ 101,905 Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables 5,521 5,780 Other income 421 286 Total revenues 125,842 107,971 Expenses: Interest 29,339 29,640 Property costs 1,341 806 General and administrative 10,851 10,243 Depreciation and amortization 42,310 35,215 Provisions for impairment 1,570 4,270 Total expenses 85,411 80,174 Income from operations before income taxes 40,431 27,797 Income tax expense 49 106 Income before gain on dispositions of real estate 40,382 27,691 Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of tax 9,578 3,699 Net income\n$ 49,960 $ 31,390 Net income per share of common stock - basic and diluted: $ 0.26 $ 0.19 Weighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n194,686,790 160,810,455 Diluted\n194,876,748 160,810,455 Dividends declared per common share $ 0.31 $ 0.29 STORE Capital Corporation\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\n(unaudited) (audited) Assets Investments: Real estate investments: Land and improvements $ 1,952,205 $ 1,898,342 Buildings and improvements 4,144,511 3,958,003 Intangible lease assets 88,712 87,402 Total real estate investments 6,185,428 5,943,747 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (463,071 ) (426,931 ) 5,722,357 5,516,816 Real estate investments held for sale, net 6,867 16,741 Loans and direct financing receivables 299,098 271,453 Net investments 6,028,322 5,805,010 Cash and cash equivalents 35,116 42,937 Other assets, net 65,410 51,830 Total assets $ 6,128,848 $ 5,899,777 Liabilities and stockholders' equity Liabilities: Credit facility $ 97,000 $ 290,000 Unsecured notes and term loans payable, net 915,711 570,595 Non-recourse debt obligations of consolidated special purpose entities, net 1,711,914 1,736,306 Dividends payable 61,394 60,068 Accrued expenses, deferred revenue and other liabilities 80,159 71,866 Total liabilities 2,866,178 2,728,835 Stockholders' equity: Common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 375,000,000 shares authorized, 198,044,148 and 193,766,854 shares issued and outstanding, respectively 1,980 1,938 Capital in excess of par value 3,479,460 3,381,090 Distributions in excess of retained earnings (227,074 ) (214,845 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 8,304 2,759 Total stockholders' equity 3,262,670 3,170,942 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 6,128,848 $ 5,899,777 STORE Capital Corporation\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 (unaudited) Net income $ 49,960 $ 31,390 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 42,068 35,074 Provision for impairment of real estate – 4,270 Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of tax (9,578 ) (3,699 ) Funds from Operations 82,450 67,035 Adjustments: Straight-line rental revenue, net (1,112 ) (1,155 ) Amortization of: Equity-based compensation 1,466 1,874 Deferred financing costs and other noncash interest expense 2,103 2,009 Lease-related intangibles and costs 243 195 Provision for loan losses 1,570 – Gain on extinguishment of debt (814 ) – Adjusted Funds from Operations $ 85,906 $ 69,958 Dividends declared to common stockholders $ 61,394 $ 49,700 Net income per share of common stock: (1)\nBasic and Diluted $ 0.26 $ 0.19 FFO per share of common stock: (1) Basic and Diluted $ 0.42 $ 0.42 AFFO per share of common stock: (1) Basic and Diluted $ 0.44 $ 0.43 (1) Under the two-class method, earnings attributable to unvested restricted stock are deducted from earnings\nin the computation of per share amounts where applicable.\nSTORE Capital Corporation\nInvestment Portfolio\nMarch 31, 2018\nReal Estate Portfolio Information\nAs of March 31, 2018, STORE Capital’s total investment in real estate and loans approximated $6.5 billion, representing investments in 2,000 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers for its customers.
