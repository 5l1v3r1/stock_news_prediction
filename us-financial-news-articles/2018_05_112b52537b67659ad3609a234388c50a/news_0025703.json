The notes were first marketed in the low 8 percent area yield and low 9 percent mark.\nTotal books passed $5.5 billion, evenly split between the two tranches, lead advisers said.\n“It’s a marked success for Accra because they got a low yield and a bigger size,” a sovereign debt market watcher told Reuters. “The pricing revision may have aided the deal and left investors unhappy.”\nIt was Ghana’s sixth sale since a 2007 debut.\nLead advisers for the sale were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered. Ghana is rated B3/B-/B\nThe government plans to use some of the proceeds to refinance debt and up to $750 million as revenue for its 2018 budget.\nGhana, which exports cocoa, gold and oil, is in its final year of a $918 million IMF credit deal to narrow fiscal deficit, inflation and public debt which hit 69 percent of gross domestic product in December.\nThe Thursday sale by Ghana followed similar big transactions by continental peers Angola, Kenya and Nigeria.
