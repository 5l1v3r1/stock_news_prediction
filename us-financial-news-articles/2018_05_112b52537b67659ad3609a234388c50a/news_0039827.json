In all of 2017, there were 18 defaults involving 39.3 billion yuan.\nThe wave of defaults has been accompanied by an increase in the premium investors demand for holding riskier debt.\nThe spread between 5-year Chinese government bonds and AA-rated 5-year corporate bonds was at 211 basis points on Friday, an increase of nearly 48 basis points over the previous six months.
