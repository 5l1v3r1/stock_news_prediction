It was a defining moment and he could have said to the world, not the United States, that we were better than that.”\nTwo days after the event, Trump said the KKK and similar groups were “repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans”.\n71st Cannes Film Festival - Photocall for the film \"BlacKkKlansman\" in competition - Cannes, France, May 15, 2018.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard That was too late for Lee: “This film to me is a wake-up call,” he said.\n“Because we’ve gone for the “okey doke”, walking around in a daze, and stuff is happening and it’s topsy turvy and fake has been trumpeted as truth.\n“That’s what this film is about and I know in my heart, I don’t care what the critics say or anybody else, we are on the right side of history with this film.”\nAt the “BlacKkKlansman” premiere, the audience laughed and applauded scenes in which KKK members use distinctly Trumpian rhetoric, saying, for example, that purging the country of ethnic minorities would “make America great again”.\nIndieWire critic David Ehrlich said: “Far more frightening than it is funny (especially after Lee connects the dots from Colorado Springs to Charlottesville), “BlacKkKlansman” packages such weighty and ultra-relevant subjects into the form of a wildly uneven but consistently entertaining night at the movies.”\nSlideshow (4 Images) The film marks a return to Cannes for Lee almost 30 years after “Do the Right Thing” missed out on the Palme d’Or.\n“BlacKkKlansman” is in the running for this year’s prize, set to be awarded on May 19.\nReporting by Robin Pomeroy; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:49:57.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
