Analysts on average were expecting profit of $2.12 per share on revenue of $12.76 billion.\nDriving the raised forecast was organic growth as well as the company's March acquisition of software maker MuleSoft, said Mark Hawkins, Salesforce chief financial officer.\nYou can see the implied growth rate is very, very strong,\" Hawkins told Reuters on a call. \"That's growth at scale that is hard to find.\"\nSalesforce has been a key beneficiary of so-called digital transformations - a growing trend in which companies move their operations onto lower cost cloud-based services that offer more scalability.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 74 cents per share, beating analysts average estimate of 46 cents per share.\nRevenue from the company's flagship product, Sales Cloud, rose 16.3 percent to $965 million.\nThe company's unearned revenue - a key metric used to measure future business for subscription-based software vendors - rose 25 percent to $6.20 billion.\nAnalysts on average expected $6.27 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.\n\"We see strong demand for digital transformation in areas including customer support and marketing, so its unsurprising Salesforce is seeing high growth,\" said Blair Hanley Frank, principal analyst at research and advisory firm ISG.\nSalesforce accounted for about 20 percent of the 2017 global customer relationship management software market, up from 18.1 percent in 2016, according to research firm IDC.\nOracle Corp is the company's closest rival with 7.1 percent of the market. However, Microsoft Corp's Dynamics enterprise software is emerging as a major competitor after nearly tripling its market share to 4 percent in 2017.\n\"What we need to do is stay confident in our ability to deliver success for our customers,\" said Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Keith Block when asked about Microsoft's growing market share.\nSalesforce reported net income of $344 million, or 46 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30, compared with $1 million, or breakeven per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 25.4 percent to $3.01 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
