But it has lost momentum as Treasury yields have pulled back from four-year peaks.\nThe Australian dollar traded flat after dropping to $0.7525 on Monday, its lowest since Dec. 12.\nThe currency showed little response to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s well anticipated decision on Tuesday to leave its cash rate unchanged at 1.50 percent.\nCurrencies such as the Australian and the New Zealand dollar, which previously enjoyed the support of relatively high interest rates, have declined as their yield advantages have been eroded, particularly against the dollar.\nThe New Zealand dollar extended its decline to touch $0.7029 , its lowest since Dec. 27. The kiwi fell nearly 3 percent in April.
