Total U.S. revenue was $29.5 million, a 3.2% increase compared to the same period of the prior year.\nOrthobiologics revenue totaled $18.0 million, a 5.2% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017, and was led by growth in our DBM franchise. Spinal Implants revenue totaled $15.2 million, a 2.6% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017, and was driven by growth in the Shoreline and Mariner systems.\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 63.3%, compared to 58.7% for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by lower raw material and manufacturing costs for orthobiologics products manufactured at the Company's Irvine, California facility.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $28.0 million, compared to $27.8 million for the same period of the prior year. The $0.2 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower R&D and general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.1 million, compared to a net loss of $9.1 million for the same period of the prior year.\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 totaled $12.5 million and the Company had no outstanding borrowings against its $30 million credit facility.
