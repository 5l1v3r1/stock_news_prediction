Consequently, the need for investment remains high,” CEO Schaeppi said.\n“At the same time, prices are falling and promotions are intensifying the competition.”\nSwisscom has reduced its staff by 4.4 percent in the last year and reduced spending on property, facilities and equipment.\nIn February it increased its cost-cutting target to fight competition from more agile rivals.\nIt aims to keep capital expenditure below 2.4 billion this year and reduce costs in Switzerland by 100 million francs a year through 2020, in part by eliminating 700 jobs.\nThe company kept it guidance for 2018 EBITDA of around 4.2 billion on revenue of around 11.6 billion.\nIt proposed an unchanged dividend of 22 francs per share, the level it also targets for next year should it hit its goals.\n$1 = 0.9955 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill and Michael Shields; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:30:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
