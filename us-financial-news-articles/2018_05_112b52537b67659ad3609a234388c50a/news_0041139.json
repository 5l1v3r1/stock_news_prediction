The fact that Justify is the heavy favorite and Good Magic is the second choice makes plenty of sense,” Amoss told reporters.

In the last two years, the Derby runner-up finished ahead of the Derby winner in the Preakness.\nRidden by Mike Smith, Justify won the Derby as the favorite and all eyes will be on whether the Bob Baffert-trained chestnut son of Scat Daddy can create some intrigue going into the June 9 Belmont Stakes, the final stop for the Crown.

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\nHis biggest threat is considered to be the Chad Brown-trained Good Magic, who finished 2-1/2 lengths behind Justify over the soggy track at Churchill Downs two weeks ago and won last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile.\nBrown is well aware of the challenge awaiting Good Magic and jockey Jose Ortiz in taking down Justify, who is undefeated in four starts.\n“I love what I see,” Brown said after Good Magic jogged over the wet track. “The horse’s weight continues to hold very well.\n“He’s had three good gallops over an off track here at Pimlico ... He’s very fit. As you can see, he’s full of himself. His energy level is where we want it to be.”\nA repeat of the soggy track that greeted the 20 horses at the Kentucky Derby is likely on Saturday with more rain expected in Baltimore.\nHall of Fame trainer Baffert is not looking for Justify to make a big step forward in the Preakness.\n“He just has to stay the way he is,” said Baffert, who has won the Preakness Stakes six times, including with all four of his previous Derby winners. “He ran hard early and fast (in the Derby).\n“It’s muddy. The break still is so important. The main thing is that you have a good horse.” Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T21:35:45.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
