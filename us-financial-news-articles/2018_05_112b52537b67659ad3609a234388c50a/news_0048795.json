He cited the overlap of hacking code with malware used in previous cyber attacks that the U.S. government have attributed to Moscow. Related Coverage Ukraine warns of massive cyber attack before Champions League final\nCisco, which uncovered the campaign several months ago, alerted authorities in Ukraine and the United States before going public with its findings about the malware it dubbed VPNFilter.\nIt also shared technical details with rivals who sell security software, hardware and services so they could issue alerts to their customers and protect against the threat.\nCisco described the mechanisms that the malware uses to hide communications with hackers and a module that targets industrial networks like ones that operate electric grids, said Michael Daniel, chief executive officer of Cyber Threat Alliance, a nonprofit group.

Victims included Beiersdorf AG ( BEIG.DE ), FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ), Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ), Mondelez International Inc ( MDLZ.O ) and Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc ( RB.L ).\nCisco said it does not know what the hackers have planned. The malware could be used for espionage, to interfere with internet communications or launch a destructive attack like NotPetya, according to Williams.\nThe Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia has denied assertions by nations including Ukraine and Western cyber-security firms that it is behind a massive global hacking program that has included attempts to harm Ukraine’s economy and interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nVPNFilter has infected devices in at least 54 countries, but by far the largest number is in Ukraine, according to Cisco.\nNetgear representative Nathan Papadopulos said the company was looking into the matter. He advised customers to make sure their routers are patched with the latest version of its firmware, disable remote management and make sure they have changed default passwords shipped with the device.\nA Linksys spokeswoman had no immediate comment. MikroTik, TP-Link and QNAP could not be reached.
