Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk\nPeople place bets in the sports book area of the South Point Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas this month. Associated Press/John Locher Good morning. The U.S. Supreme Court decision last week to permit legalized sports gambling in whatever state wants it renews concerns about preserving the integrity of the sporting events and the preventing of widespread money laundering and tax evasion.\nTo detect money laundering and other financial crimes, regulators and sports-betting operations must establish “early-warning systems” to detect irregular betting patterns or attempts to fix games, said Emanuel Macedo de Medeiros, chief executive of the Sports Integrity Global Alliance, a coalition of sports bodies, governments, anticorruption NGOs, inter-governmental organizations and commercial partners.\nThat means making significant investment in intelligence and establishing close working relationships with law enforcement, he said. “The purpose of regulating sports betting clearly is to stop those threats, and that implies a large-scale, concerted effort,” he said.\nThe threat of players, referees, medical staff or team owners making bets or fixing results needs to be countered with effective regulation and law enforcement. That means establishing who can take bets, who can make bets, what types of bets will be permitted, and setting a cap on how much can be bet, said Mr. de Medeiros.\nThat best could be done by a federal law governing betting in all states, said Mr. de Medeiros, who thinks the more-likely scenario will involve each state establishing its own rules. “My concern is this may lead to a fragmentation of the rules,” he said.\nThe court’s decision gives concerned parties “one bite of the apple” to put in place a program that has the proper compliance and anti-money laundering controls, said John Arvanitis, associate managing director in Kroll Inc.’s compliance practice.\nFor betting houses, this means identifying who your customers are and conducting due diligence to make sure you know where the money being wagered is coming from, said Mr. Arvanitis.\nCompanies taking bets will have to invest in more technology and hire more people to be able to conduct due diligence on their customers and to make sure they can meet the increase in wagering that is expected as more people will be able to bet legally, said Mr. Arvanitis.\nCompanies looking to be licensed to take bets need to “take a step back before they leap” and think about how to meet their regulatory obligations, said Mr. Arvanitis. Every entity that takes bets must “be positioned to protect the financial and economic infrastructure of this country because corrupted money can make its way in through multiple venues,” he said.\nCOMPLIANCE\nA divided Supreme Court on Monday gave businesses the power to block employees from joining together to file claims for wage theft and other work-related violations, upholding employer-written rules requiring that each case be limited to a single employee, the WSJ reports.\nThe Supreme Court said companies can block workers from banding together when filing workplace claims.

SCOTT APPLEWHITE/ASSOCIATED PRESS The U.S. and China have agreed on the broad outline of a deal that would save imperiled Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. , according to people with knowledge of the matter in both countries, as the two sides move closer to resolving their trade dispute, the WSJ reports.\nChina will reduce its tariff on imported autos to 15% from 25% starting July 1, the government said.

That would likely make the fund’s proxy ballots invalid, HomeStreet said, the WSJ reports.\nREPUTATION\nStarbucks revealed more details of its policy on nonpaying guests .
