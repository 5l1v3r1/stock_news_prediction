With a new normal for short-term rates of around 2.5 percent, interest rates are likely to remain low relative to historical experience,” he said.\nSome consensus around the neutral rate is central to the Fed’s policymaking in the coming year, and will shape when the Fed signals to the public that the era of loose policy is over.\nWilliams has been among the most active of Fed policymakers in researching and developing methods to estimate the neutral rate.\nAs New York Fed president with a permanent vote on policy, his influence on the issue may well increase. Incoming vice chair Richard Clarida is also considered an expert on the topic.\n“Some economists and central bankers have pointed to signs that the fortunes of r-star are set to rise,” Williams said. “I wish I could join in this optimism, but I don’t yet see convincing evidence.” (Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
