(NYSE: QES) (“QES” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue grew 8% to $141.3 million, up from $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 net loss was $16.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $15.5 million, compared to a net income of $2.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, revenue was $85.4 million, net loss was $11.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $4.0 million. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this release for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nRogers Herndon, QES’ President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “As expected, our first quarter results were impacted by some transient events that negatively impacted our utilization levels and compressed margins. Still, we achieved commendable revenue gains and exited the first quarter at a strong activity level. We believe that the macroeconomic outlook continues to exhibit momentum building around anticipated drilling and completion activities, which is a reliable indicator of the overall demand for our services. We enter the second quarter looking to increase profitability through strong project execution and higher activity levels.”\nBusiness Segment Results\nThe following business segments comprise the Company’s primary services: Directional Drilling; Pressure Pumping; Pressure Control; and Wireline.\nDirectional Drilling\nThe Directional Drilling segment provides the highly-technical and essential services of guiding horizontal and directional drilling operations for exploration and production (“E&P”) companies. Revenue was $37.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, down approximately 2% compared to revenue of $38.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 but up 21% from the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The sequential reduction in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to supply chain issues compressing margins and a decline in lost-in-hole revenue for the quarter. Specifically, we experienced elevated motor rental and repair expenses driven by delays in third-party repair turnarounds. In the first quarter of 2017, revenue was $31.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 million.\nPressure Pumping\nThe Pressure Pumping segment primarily provides hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies. Revenue for the segment grew 8% to $53.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $49.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $9.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $10.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, revenue was $26.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 million.\nPressure Control\nThe Pressure Control segment consists of coiled tubing, rig-assisted snubbing, nitrogen, and well control services. Revenue for the segment grew approximately 6% to $28.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $26.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, revenue was $18.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.3 million.\nWireline\nThe Wireline segment primarily provides cased-hole wireline services to E&P companies. Revenue for the segment grew 34% to $22.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to strong activity levels coupled with improved pricing in the segment. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, revenue was $9.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1.4 million.\nOther Financial Information\nGeneral and administrative expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $29.9 million, compared to $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $17.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The sequential increase in G&A expenses was primarily related to a non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nCapital expenditures including deposits totalled $12.4 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to capital expenditures of $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter interest expense was $10.2 million, up from $3.0 million in the fourth quarter and up from $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to $5.3 million of unamortized term loan discount expense, accelerated deferred financing costs expensed of $3 million, and a prepayment fee of $1.3 million as a result of extinguishing the Former Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) and Former Term Loan (defined below) during the first quarter of 2018. The increase was offset by a $1.0 million reduction in interest expense due to having less debt outstanding in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nWith the closing of the IPO subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Company’s debt structure has improved meaningfully. QES ended the first quarter of 2018 with a total debt balance of $13.0 million, $16.6 million of cash on hand, and $61.4 million of net availability under its new $100 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility.\nConference Call Information\nQES has scheduled a conference call for 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Thursday, May 10, 2018, to review reported results.

(2) Rigs on revenue represents the number of rigs earning revenues during a given time period, including days that standby revenues are earned. (3) Includes unconventional stages and conventional jobs, the latter are counted as a single stage. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or (loss) plus income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, net (gain) or loss on disposition of assets, stock based compensation, transaction expenses, rebranding expenses, settlement expenses, severance expenses and equipment standup expense.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated:\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(In thousands of dollars)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nAdjustments to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income Net (loss) income $ (16,356 ) $ 2,068 $ (11,673 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 51 22 (6 ) Interest expense, net 10,192 2,961 2,601 Other income — 58 — Depreciation and amortization expense 11,078 11,423 11,594 Gain on disposition of assets, net (106 ) (339 ) (1,657 ) Non-cash stock based compensation 9,886 — — Transaction expense (1) — 822 — Rebranding expense (2) — — 1 Settlement expense (3) 223 339 1,439 Severance expense (4) — 41 182 Equipment standup expense (5) 515 1,387 1,491 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15,483 $ 18,782 $ 3,972 (1) For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 we did not incur transaction related expenses.
