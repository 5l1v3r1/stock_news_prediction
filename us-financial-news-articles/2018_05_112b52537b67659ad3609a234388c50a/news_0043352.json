REUTERS/Hannah McKay/Pool The experience has changed with the passage of time. When she first went as a spectator to Prince Charles and Diana’s wedding in 1981, she was with a group of friends. Now it has become a family tradition and her husband comes along.\nThe Boothbys were among thousands of well-wishers who boarded trains out of London on the way to Windsor to watch the wedding of Prince Harry and U.S. actress Megan Markle.\nWearing a Union Jack dress, Boothby said she had come down from Boston in central England the night before and got up at 4 a.m. to get an early train to Windsor to watch the celebrations.\n“It is a magical occasion and being here will create memories that will last forever,” she said.\nRoyal fans gather outside Windsor Castle ahead of wedding of Britain's Prince Harry to Meghan Markle in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018.
