REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\nThe world’s third largest economy shrank by 0.6 percent on an annualised basis, a much more severe contraction than the median estimate for an annualised 0.2 percent decline.\nThe contraction, which was driven by declines in investment and consumption and weaker export growth, comes as Japan Inc frets over the possible effects of U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies on exports.\nIt also highlights the central bank’s vulnerability to an economic or financial shock after five years of heavy monetary stimulus has left it with little ammunition to defend growth.\nEconomy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said there was no change to the government’s view that the economy was recovering moderately, predicting a resumption in growth to be driven mainly by private consumption and capital expenditure.\n“But we need to be mindful of the impact of overseas economic uncertainty and market volatility,” he added. Related Coverage Japan's economy minister Motegi: Economy recovering moderately\nExternal demand - or exports minus imports - added just 0.1 percentage point to first-quarter GDP as imports slowed more than exports.\nHowever, a breakdown of the data shows export growth is losing momentum, expanding just 0.6 percent in the first quarter after growth of 2.2 percent October-December last year.\nSlower export growth reflected a decline in shipments of mobile phone parts and factory equipment in the quarter, a government official said.\nThis is a concern for Japanese manufacturers because many of these machines and electronic components are sent to China, where they are used to produce goods for export, but this trade is at risk if the Trump administration’s threatened tariffs on Chinese exports go ahead.

The median estimate was for a 0.4 percent increase. A woman in a Kimono makes her way at a shopping district in Tokyo, Japan March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\nThe capital spending figures may presage data due on Thursday that is forecast to show core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, fell in March for the first time in three months.\nConsumer spending fell marginally, registering a decline of less than one percentage point in the first quarter. The median estimate was for consumer spending to remain unchanged.\n“The economy is unlikely to continue to contract further. The global economy is performing well and the yen is trading beyond 110 yen against the dollar, so once exports start to grow again, the economy will return to a moderate growth path,” said\nMaruyama of SMBC Nikko Securities.\nThe first-quarter contraction could make Japanese politicians more reluctant to implement a hike in sales tax to 10 percent from the current 8 percent scheduled for next year.\nA sales tax hike to 5 percent from 3 percent in 2014 caused a large fall in consumer spending and tipped the economy into recession.\n“The revised GDP data 2017 showed the economy had already started to slow down from the beginning of last year. And the economic contraction for January-March may support some ruling officials’ call for a delay in a planned sales tax hike,” said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Credit Agricole Securities.
