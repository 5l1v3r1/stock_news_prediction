From now on, the limousine will replace the fleet of imported vehicles Putin uses, state television reported.\nCelestino Arce | NurPhoto via Getty Images Demonstration against Putin in Pushkin square, Moscow, Russia, on 5 May 2018. With Putin sworn in, immediate attention will turn to whom Putin will nominate as his prime minister. If he asks the current holder of the post, his loyal lieutenant Dmitry Medvedev, to stay on, that will signal continuity.\nIf he chooses someone new, that could presage a fresh approach on policy and will also trigger speculation that Putin is grooming a successor. Once this term ends in 2024, the constitution bars him from running again.\nStandoff Foreign diplomats see little prospect that Russia's standoffs with the West that have dominated the past four years will ease during Putin's new term.\nClashes in the past few weeks over U.S. sanctions on Russia, the conflict in Syria, and the poisoning in England of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal have left some diplomats worried that the confrontation could spiral out of control.\nOpinion polls show Putin has high levels of support among Russian citizens, and Navalny has not been able to inspire a nationwide upsurge of protests.\nBut the Russian economy is a potential weakness for Putin.\nBuffeted by lower oil prices, falls in the rouble, inflation and the impact of sanctions, average monthly wages have fallen from the equivalent of $867 in 2013 to $553 last year.\nRussia's economy, the world's eleventh largest, returned to growth of 1.5 percent last year, helped by a recovery in oil prices. But that fell short of the government's 2 percent target and was far from the 8.5 percent growth achieved in 2007, the highest level achieved during Putin's rule.\nSasha Mordovets | Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (L) attend a meeting in Moscow in May 2015. Officials and analysts say bold policies with the best chance of reviving growth have been mired in disagreements among Putin's policy-makers.\nThere is little clarity too about what happens after 2024. By then Putin will be 71. He will soon have ruled longer than Soviet Communist leader Leonid Brezhnev, whose 18-year rule from 1964 to 1982 is primarily associated with stagnation.\nLikely options include Putin leaving the Kremlin but continuing to run the country from another post, or bowing out of public life and handing over to an anointed successor.\nKremlin insiders say Putin has not selected any heir apparent, and that any names being circulated are the product of speculation, not knowledge of Putin's thinking.\nThe names include Igor Sechin, head of state oil firm Rosneft; Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu; Alexei Dyumin, a former Putin bodyguard who became a regional governor, and Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin.\nAnointing a successor entails dangers for Putin as doing so too soon would risk him becoming a lame duck, allegiances shifting from him to the heir apparent and new turf wars being set off in the ruling elite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T13:33:02.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
