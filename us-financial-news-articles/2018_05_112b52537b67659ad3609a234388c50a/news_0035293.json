(\"ImmunoCellular\") (NYSE American: IMUC) today announced financial results for the first quarter\nAnthony J. Gringeri, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer commented: \"In the first quarter, we continued to make progress in advancing our Stem-to-T-Cell program. In April we announced that we had been able to verify successful transfer of the selected T cell receptor genetic material into human hematopoietic stem cells. This milestone represents the next important step in validating the Stem-to-T-Cell approach, and is a key component of the proof-of-concept work for this technology which lays the groundwork for undertaking planning for preclinical testing. From a corporate perspective, we are continuing to work with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. as our strategic financial advisor to assist in the review of our business and assets and the exploration of strategic opportunities for enhancing stockholder value, including the potential sale or merger of the Company.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, ImmunoCellular incurred a net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.9 million or $1.67 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the net loss is primarily due to the suspension of the ICT-107 phase 3 trial in June of 2017 and reductions in the Company's other research and development programs along with reductions in general and administrative expenses.\nImmunoCellular also reported $1.6 million of cash used in operations during the most recent quarter compared to $6.1 million in the same period in 2017. The Company continues to seek favorable payment terms with its creditors and reduced its current liabilities by almost $900,000 during the quarter. No warrants were exercised in the most recent quarter; accordingly, there were no financing proceeds. There are approximately $930,000 of warrants that remain outstanding from the July 2017 financing. These warrants currently have an exercise price of $0.35 and expire in July 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $5 million of cash and 41.9 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nIn light of previous recent updates on its research program, ImmunoCellular is not holding a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results at this time. The Company plans to provide relevant updates at an appropriate time in the future.\nAbout ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd.\nImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., based in Los Angeles, is developing immune-based therapies for the treatment of cancer.
