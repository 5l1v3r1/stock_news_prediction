Lawrence was fantastic.”\nThomas’s first save denied O’Donovan from close range in the 17th minute but the second on the half hour mark was even better, the goalkeeper getting down to stop a Riley McGree drive and doing just enough to prevent Jason Hoffman netting the rebound.\nThe Jets, reflecting the spirit of their phlegmatic Scottish coach Ernie Merrick, stuck patiently to their game plan but were unable to make the breakthrough.\nThe visitors worked their way back into the match after halftime, though, and O’Donovan put his body on the line to stop them from doubling the lead in a goalmouth scramble.\nVictory boss Kevin Muscat has been part of all four of the club’s titles - a record tally for one club in the short history of the A-League - two as captain under Merrick and two as coach.\nSaturday’s was probably the toughest to win, achieved from fourth place in the league after a rollercoaster ride of season during which Muscat was booed by the club’s fans at times.\n“We’ve had a lot of challenges this season but we’ve faced them all down,” Muscat said.\n“It got to the point that it seemed like the whole country wanted us to fall over at the final hurdle but the boys dug deep and in the end it was just an almighty battle.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T17:34:47.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
