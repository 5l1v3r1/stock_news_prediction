Insurance by Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp on an additional 2035 maturity produced a lower yield of 4.05 percent.\nSpreads over MMD’s scale ranged from 193 basis points to 224 basis points for uninsured bonds and were as high as 135 basis points for insured bonds.\nEscalating pension payments have led to junk credit ratings, drained reserves and debt dependency for CPS, the country’s third-largest public school system.\nThe district still has an “extremely weak cash position,” according to S&P Global Markets, which last week rated the bonds at ‘B’ with a positive outlook.\nThe sale came a day after the Illinois State Board of Education placed the district’s special education services under supervision after finding some CPS policies and practices violated a federal law protecting disabled children’s’ right to a free and appropriate public education.
