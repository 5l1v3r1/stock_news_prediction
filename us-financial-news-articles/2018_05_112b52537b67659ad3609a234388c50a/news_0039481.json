The location has direct access to a river providing unlimited water and the energy costs are wholesale value and are eligible for \"Transmission Rate\" with the local power authority ($.05 CDN / KwH) with 38 MG Watt service at the property line.

(\"Acreage Pharms\"), a licensed producer under the ACMPR located in West-Central Alberta on 150 acres, has approximately 40,000 square feet of cannabis ready production with its recently completed Phase 2 expansion.

During the first quarter of 2018 AB Labs submitted a secondary license to Health Canada for a nearby property on 100 acres under the name AB Ventures Inc. (\"AB Ventures\"). Once AB Ventures receives its ACMPR license, the entire property will have the potential for cannabis cultivation.

OptionCo will give us a significant footprint in British Columbia already adding to our large footprint in Alberta and Ontario.
