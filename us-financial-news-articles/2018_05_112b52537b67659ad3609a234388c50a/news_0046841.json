It has also spoken of fears that she and her father are being held against their will.\nAfter her televised statement, Peskov said many unanswered questions remained.\n“We still don’t know what condition Yulia Skripal is in,” said Peskov.\n“We don’t know if she made these statements of her own free will or if she was pressured, we don’t where she is ... and what is being done to her and by whom, to what extent her rights are being upheld, and how legally competent she is,” said Peskov.\nYulia Skripal said on Wednesday she was grateful for the Russian embassy’s offers of help, but did not want to avail herself of them.\nSpeaking to Reuters at a secret location in London, she spoke in Russian and supplied a statement that she said she had written herself in both Russian and English.\nShe signed both documents after making her statement, but declined to answer questions after speaking to camera.\nRussian media were suspicious.\n“Yulia seemed determined, but lost,” Komsomolskaya Pravda, a pro-Kremlin tabloid quoted a psychologist as saying. “She was called to the blackboard like a schoolgirl who had learned a poem off by heart and had to recite it without stumbling.”\nViktoria Skripal, Yulia’s cousin, told Reuters she was happy to see her cousin was safe.\n“I will now be asking the international community to abide by Yulia’s will. If she wants to come back to Russia then let her.” Yulia Skripal, who was poisoned in Salisbury along with her father, Russian spy Sergei Skripal, speaks to Reuters in London, Britain, May 23, 2018.
