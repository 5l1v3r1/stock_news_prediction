Futon Taxi Corp. A lawyer for Cohen declined to comment.\nCohen, a former Trump Organization executive, has been President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer and has claimed to be a loyal “fixer” for his longtime boss. He claims he drew on a home-equity loan to pay $130,000 to Stormy Daniels , a porn actress who said she had sex with Trump in 2006, to buy her silence in the run-up to the 2016 election.\nBefore he started working for Trump, Cohen built his wealth in the taxi business in New York and Chicago.\nCohen claims the taxes are owed not by him but by Evgeny “Gene” Friedman, known in New York as “The Taxi King.” Friedman, who operated more than 800 cabs in the city, including Cohen’s, goes on trial in June on charges he pocketed more than $5 million in 50-cent fare surcharges that were supposed to benefit New York mass transit. Friedman’s lawyer says he’s innocent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T13:53:44.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
