And the jury that will award the Palme d’Or is this year headed by a woman, Australian actress Cate Blanchett, and is majority-female.\nBut Blanchett said the increased awareness of women’s issues would have “no direct impact” on who wins.\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that of the 21 films in the main competition, there were only three directed by women, Blanchett told a news conference:\n“A few years ago there were only two!”\n“Is (MeToo) going to have a direct impact upon the films in competition this year, six, nine months on? Not specifically. There are several women in competition but they are not there because of their gender, they are there for the quality of their work.”\nShe added: “Would I like to see more women in competition? Absolutely. Do I expect and hope that’s going to happen in the future? I hope so.” 71st Cannes Film Festival - Opening ceremony and screening of the film \"Everybody Knows\" (Todos lo saben) in competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France, May 8, 2018 - cast members Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem arrive. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\nBut, as if to show how women must not be overlooked in cinema, she had a barbed response to a reporter who asked the “filmmakers” - meaning the directors, rather than actors - on the jury to answer “why are movies still important?”\n“Actresses: don’t answer that because you have no idea how to answer that question!” Blanchett said with a raised eyebrow to fellow jury members Lea Seydoux and Kristen Stewart (an actress who has recently moved into directing).\nThe news conference was the last time the five-women, four-men jury will speak to the media until the end of the fortnight.\nAfter Farhadi, another Iranian director, Jafar Panahi, will screen a movie in competition, but will be unable to attend the festival as he is officially banned from film-making by his government. Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov will also be absent as he is under house arrest in Russia on charges that his supporters say are politically motivated.\nBlanchett, who called their plight “a terrible situation” was asked it that would alter the way their films are judged.\n“It’s not a political film festival,” she replied, insisting that all films will be judged solely on their artistic merits.\n“This is not the Nobel Peace Prize, it’s the Palme d’Or.” Slideshow (3 Images)\nThe festival runs from May 8 to May 19.
