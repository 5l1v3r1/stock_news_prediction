However, Dan Nathan, co-founder and editor of RiskReversal.com, warns the options market could be predicting that the Chinese tech-heavy ETF could be in jeopardy.\nTencent , Samsung, Alibaba and Taiwan Semiconductor make up roughly 16 percent of the EEM. While the stocks have been hot over the last year, they are all down sharply from their recent highs.\nTuesday on CNBC's \" Fast Money,\" Nathan noted that there was an abundance of bearish activity this week.\nSpecifically, Nathan pointed out a trader's purchase of 21,000 June 42/45 put spreads, paying 55 cents per contract. This is a bearish bet that the emerging markets ETF will fall below $44.45 by June, or down nearly 5 percent from its current levels.\n\"Pretty interesting breakdown level in $42, [it] may be some decent support surrounding a 'toppy' sort of feel\" he said. \"So maybe this is a little protection against a long position in the EEM.\"\nShares of the emerging markets ETF have fallen 1 percent so far this year and were down Wednesday afternoon at around $46.60.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T22:34:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
