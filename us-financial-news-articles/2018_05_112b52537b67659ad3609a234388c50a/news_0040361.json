The company’s patented and proprietary technology platform, called SPIRIT, creates novel therapies that target neoantigens or altered self-antigens – which are antigens encoded by tumor-specific mutated genes – and are designed to overcome self-tolerance by eliciting a potent cellular and humoral immune response to eliminate cancer cells. Sensei’s precision medicine approach in immuno-oncology includes novel therapies along with companion diagnostics. The company’s lead drug candidate, SNS-301, is a first-in-class cancer vaccine that targets a novel embryonic self-antigen and has successfully completed a Phase 1 clinical study. Sensei Biotherapeutics is located in Gaithersburg, MD.
