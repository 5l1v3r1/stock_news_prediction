(AP) â€” Billionaire Warren Buffett is preparing to auction off another private lunch to raise money for a homeless charity in San Francisco.\nOver the past 18 years, Berkshire Hathaway's chairman and CEO has raised more than $26 million for the Glide Foundation through the annual auctions.\nLast year's winner got a relative bargain by paying $2,679,001for the lunch. The record price for the auction is $3,456,789 that winners paid in 2016 and 2012.\nThis year's eBay auction starts on May 27 and runs through 9:30 p.m. Central on June 1.\nBuffett became involved with the Glide Foundation after his first wife, Susie, volunteered at the charity. She died in 2004, but the connection between Buffett and the group endured.\nThe winner can invite up to seven friends to join the lunch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:49:05.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
