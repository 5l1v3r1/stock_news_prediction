The bigger threats could come later.\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled his blueprint to lower drug prices, called \"American Patients First,\" in a highly anticipated speech on Friday. However, his actions weren't as biting as his words suggested.\nThe proposal included few immediate actions the administration would take but none that would bring any massive reforms.
