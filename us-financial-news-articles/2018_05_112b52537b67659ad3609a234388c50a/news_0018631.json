I feel like it was a very good match, the hardest here. She has improved a lot since last year, we played together here, and she was a different player.”\nHalep will next face Krystyna’s twin sister Karolina Pliskova, who raced past American Sloane Stephens 6-2 6-3.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T17:46:11.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
