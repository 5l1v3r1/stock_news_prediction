This has reinforced our financial foundation exponentially as we aim for further growth in the future.\nAs a result, sales for the current consolidated fiscal year were 11,927 million yen (14,143 million yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year), operating loss was 1,354 million yen (43 million yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year), ordinary loss was 909 million yen (ordinary profit of 516 million yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year), and net profit attributable to owners of the parent was 1,720 million yen (488 million yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year).\nIn this regard, in the Consolidated Cumulative 2nd Quarter, in connection with PJF becoming a subsidiary, we recorded profit on negative goodwill of 2,420 million yen in extraordinary profit.\nLink to full earnings report: http://www.prospectjapan.co.jp/release/index.html\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prospect-co-ltd-closing-announcement-of-fiscal-year-ended-march-31-2018-japanese-standards-consolidated-300648689.html\nSOURCE Prospect Co., Ltd", "external_links": ["http://www.prospectjapan.co.jp/release/index.html", "https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prospectjapan.co.jp%2Frelease%2Findex.html&data=02%7C01%7CAshish.Jethwa%40cision.com%7Cf188a7fc09ca4cfbe63e08d5ba5c0b51%7C887bf9ee3c824b88bcb280d5e169b99b%7C1%7C1%7C636619826894906427&sdata=GXp2Zxgt1e2etGf7l8XD6tm9rLno4%2FZCgEKEQ7QKroQ%3D&reserved=0", "http://www.prospectjapan.co.jp/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prospect-co-ltd-closing-announcement-of-fiscal-year-ended-march-31-2018-japanese-standards-consolidated-300648689.html"], "published": "2018-05-15T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:19:29.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
