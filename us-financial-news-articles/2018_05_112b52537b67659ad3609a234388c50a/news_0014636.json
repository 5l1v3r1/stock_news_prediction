(NYSE: MYE) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Highlights\nGAAP net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.25, compared to $0.11 in the first quarter of 2017 Adjusted net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.24, compared to $0.14 in the first quarter of 2017 Generated cash from continuing operations of $12.8 million and free cash flow of $11.6 million Net sales increased 11.7% (or 11.4% excluding currency fluctuation) compared to the first quarter of 2017 Gross profit margin of 30.9% compared to 30.6% in the first quarter of 2017\nThe Company reported net sales of $152.6 million, compared to $136.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, with the increase primarily driven by greater demand within the Company’s food and beverage end market. Gross profit margin increased 30 basis points to 30.9% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the higher sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million to $35.5 million, in the first quarter of 2018, with the increase in expenses primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Dave Banyard commented, “We are pleased with our performance to start the year, which demonstrated strong year-over-year improvement in both sales and earnings. We saw sequential improvements in key operating metrics each month, and overall improvement in gross margin and operating profit from the fourth quarter of last year.”\nBanyard continued, “Our focus on niche market strategies resulted in a third consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in our food and beverage end market. Increased demand coupled with the positive impact of last year’s manufacturing footprint realignment and restructuring initiatives produced significant operating income growth and strong free cash flow generation. We look forward to the continuation of this trend in our cash flow performance in 2018 and expect it to enable further investments in both organic and acquisitive growth.”\nQuarter Ended March 31, % Inc (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2018 2017 (Dec) Net sales $ 152,568 $ 136,572 11.7 % Gross profit $ 47,115 $ 41,761 12.8 % Gross profit margin 30.9 % 30.6 % Operating income $ 12,022 $ 8,116 48.1 % Income from continuing operations: Income (loss) $ 7,755 $ 3,458 124.3 % Income (loss) per diluted share $ 0.25 $ 0.11 127.3 % Operating income as adjusted (1) $ 11,499 $ 8,862 29.8 % Income from continuing operations as adjusted (1) : Income (loss) $ 7,395 $ 4,308 71.6 % Income (loss) per diluted share $ 0.24 $ 0.14 71.4 % EBITDA as adjusted $ 18,048 $ 16,816 7.3 % (1) Details regarding the adjusted charges are provided on the Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures included in this release.\nSegment Results\nNet sales in the Material Handling Segment increased 18.6% (or 18.2% excluding currency fluctuation) compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased volume in the Company’s food and beverage end market. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA was $23.0 million compared to $20.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of higher sales volume and the benefit from the restructuring actions taken in 2017.\nNet sales in the Distribution Segment declined 7.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net sales was partially the result of the Company’s planned exit from a low-margin custom product in the Patch Rubber business. The organization continues to work to improve sales force effectiveness in its Myers Tire Supply business. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 million compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nFor the fiscal year 2018, the Company continues to anticipate that total revenue will be up low-to-mid single-digits on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year based on strong backlog, tempered by the non-recurrence of some large, one-time orders delivered in the second half of 2017. The Company also expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $10 to $12 million, net interest expense to be between $7 and $8 million, and depreciation and amortization to be between $26 and $28 million. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will benefit the Company through a decrease in its effective tax rate, which is expected to be approximately 25%, compared to approximately 36% previously.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call and webcast for investors and analysts on Monday, May 7, at 10:00 a.m. EDT.
