Die, or join terrorist groups, or migrate,” he said.\nVarious conflicts in the region, home to a number of Islamist militant groups, have exacerbated the situation and will make it difficult to provide aid, he added.\nCollectively, WFP, UNICEF and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said they need $676 million to respond.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
