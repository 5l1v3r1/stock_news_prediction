Of course there’s uncertainty, which is what we want to combat,” Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told the Televisa network Friday.\nMr. Guajardo said he thinks there is a 40% chance an agreement can be reached before Mexico’s presidential election on July 1, and an 80% chance of getting a deal done before the U.S. midterm elections in November.\nNafta negotiations have recently been bogged down over rules of origin in the auto sector and U.S. demands such as a so-called sunset clause that would allow the pact to expire after five years unless explicitly renewed and the elimination of certain mechanisms for settling disputes.\nVehicles and auto parts, which account for a third of Mexico’s manufacturing exports, are at the center of the Nafta negotiations where the U.S. is demanding greater regional and U.S. content.\nEnergy trade is less controversial for the U.S., as Mexico imports most of its gasoline and natural gas from its northern neighbor. Mexico ran up a $6.5 billion petroleum trade deficit in the January-April period, partly offset by a $4.4 billion surplus in non petroleum trade.\nWrite to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:18:15.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
