Brad Peacock entered in relief of Harris and immediately surrendered the game-tying hit to Torres before Hicks scored on a fielder’s choice grounder by Aaron Judge.\nYankees closer Aroldis Chapman struck out Jose Altuve on three 100-plus mph fastballs with the tying run on second base to earn his seventh save.\nMarwin Gonzalez and Brian McCann recorded back-to-back, run-scoring singles as the Astros fashioned a four-run rally in the seventh. Trailing 3-0, the Astros loaded the bases with no outs against Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka, with Yuli Gurriel and Josh Reddick recording singles ahead of Alex Bregman, who was hit by the 83rd and final pitch from Tanaka.\nChad Green entered in relief and surrendered the hits to Gonzalez and McCann before Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez aided the comeback with a passed ball that enabled Bregman to score the tying run and advanced Gonzalez to third. Gonzalez later scored on RBI groundout by George Springer.\nShortstop Carlos Correa belted a solo home run to left field, his fifth, off Green in the eighth. It marked the first extra-base hit of the game for the Astros and just the third in three games. Before they mounted their rally, the Astros had gone scoreless over 28 consecutive innings.\nTanaka had allowed just three singles before things came undone in the seventh. He outpitched his counterpart, Astros right-hander Lance McCullers, although McCullers steadied himself and completed seven solid innings after wobbling through the second and third.\nThe Yankees loaded the bases with no outs against McCullers in the second before Ronald Torreyes delivered a run-scoring infield single and Torres lifted a sacrifice fly to right, scoring Sanchez (walk) and Walker (hit by pitch), respectively. Walker added an RBI single in the third that scored Didi Gregorius for a 3-0 Yankees lead that seemed insurmountable given the Astros’ scoring woes.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:26:20.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
