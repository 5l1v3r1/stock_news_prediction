Cambridge Analytica denied any wrongdoing and has since gone out of business.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg eventually went on an apology tour, and Zuckerberg testified about the matter on Capitol Hill.\nDespite the public uproar and slew of bad headlines, Facebook reported first-quarter profit and sales late last month that beat Wall Street's expectations.\nIt wasn't the first time Cook took aim at Facebook over its data leak scandal. Cook criticized the social media company during an interview in March with Recode's Kara Swisher and MSNBC's Chris Hayes, saying he \"wouldn't be\" in the situation Zuckerberg found himself in.\nAt the time, Cramer said Cook's comments showed that the \"long knives\" had been drawn for Facebook.\n\"Facebook, Alphabet â€“ they're trying to get the smartest people,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street \" on Monday. \"Apple wants the smartest people. IBM wants the smartest people. If you can say listen, 'We do not take your data.' They are going to be people that say, 'You know I feel much more comfortable going to Apple than I do Facebook.'\"\nFacebook did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
