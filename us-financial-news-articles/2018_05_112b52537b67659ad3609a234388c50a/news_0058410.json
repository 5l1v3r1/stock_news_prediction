Before this game, he hadn’t allowed more than two earned runs in a game this year and had double-figures in strikeouts in each of his past three contests.\nFortunately for the Nationals, their offense came through with two-run homers by Michael A. Taylor and Matt Adams. Bryce Harper hit a two-run double in Washington’s game-winning seventh-inning rally.\nThe Marlins were led by Derek Dietrich, who hit a two-run homer, and Miguel Rojas, who added a two-run single.\nMiami third baseman Martin Prado, who started the season on the disabled list due to a knee injury, went 3-for-4 but came out of the game after reaching on an infield error on a grounder in the sixth inning. Miami announced that Prado injured his left hamstring and is day to day.\nMarlins starter Jose Urena earned a no-decision but continued his misery. After going 14-7 in a breakout 2017 season, Urena (0-7) leads the majors in losses, and the Marlins are 0-11 when he starts.\nAgainst Washington, he allowed five hits, one walk and four runs in six innings, striking out seven.\nUrena got in trouble in the second. After he hit Pedro Severino with a pitch, Taylor followed with his fourth homer of the season. He hit a 2-1 fastball that registered at 96 mph.\nMiami tied the score 2-2 in the fourth. Starlin Castro singled and advanced to second when Brian Anderson was hit by a pitch. Both runners scored when Rojas sliced a single that was short-hopped in center field by a diving Taylor.\nWashington went back on top in the sixth, taking a 4-2 lead on Adams’ 12th homer of the season — his ninth this month. After a double by Anthony Rendon, Adams hit a 96-mph fastball that landed just inches over the center-field wall, 407 feet away.\nMiami tied the score 4-4 in the bottom of the sixth when Dietrich pulled his two-run homer to the upper deck in right. Anderson led off by drawing an eight-pitch walk. Dietrich, swinging at an 87-mph cutter, followed with his fifth homer of the year.\nThe Nationals won the game in the seventh off reliever Nick Wittgren (2-1), who loaded the bases with no outs by walking two batters after allowing a leadoff double to Taylor. Trea Turner drove in one run with an infield single, preceding Harper’s two-run double.\nMiami cut its deficit to 7-5 in the bottom of the seventh on Anderson’s RBI double.\nWashington added two unearned runs in the eighth, taking advantage of a throwing error by Lewis Brinson in center field and a fielding miscue by Rojas at shortstop.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:29:55.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
