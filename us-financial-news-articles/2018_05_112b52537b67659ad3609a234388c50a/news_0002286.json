The data comes ahead of the more comprehensive U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday.\nAmong decliners was Snap, whose shares plunged more than 21.4 percent after the Snapchat owner fell short of Wall Street forecasts for revenue and regular users.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded five new 52-week highs and 13 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 18 new lows.
