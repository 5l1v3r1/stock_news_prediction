However, the plan is available once again.\nMoviePass’s $9.95 a month offer to watch a single movie each day is available on its website again along with a $7.95 plan that let’s you see three movies in a month and throws in a three-month free trial of iHeartRadio All-Access.\nLast month, MoviePass only offered a three-month plan for $30 that let users see three movies a month and included the iHeartRadio trial. The change seemed like the end of the unlimited option forever, which many already felt was likely too good to be true , especially after MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe told The Hollywood Reporter he didn’t know if the movie-per-day plan would ever return just last month.", "external_links": ["https://moviepass.com/"], "published": "2018-05-03T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T20:27:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
