Consolidated gross margin was 55.5% in Q1 2018, as compared to 57.4% in Q1 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from customers acquired during the first half of 2017 which carried a lower gross margin.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders from continuing operations in Q1 2018 was $4.2 million, or $0.20 per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to a net loss in Q1 2017 of $4.4 million, or $0.32 per share on a basic and diluted basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 2% in Q1 2018 to $3.7 million, compared to $3.6 million in Q1 2017 (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below). Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 million in Q1 2018, or 3.4% of total revenue.\nTotal cash and equivalents at March 31, 2018 was $31.0 million, compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2017. On February 5, 2018, Fusion completed a follow-on offering of 8,625,000 shares of its common stock for net proceeds before offering expenses of $38.7 million. Additionally during the first quarter, Fusion made $6.6 million of debt pay downs of its then-outstanding senior secured term loan.\nFurther details about the Company’s financial results are available in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be available in the investor relations section of the Company’s website at ir.fusionconnect.com .\nConference Call Information\nFusion Chairman and CEO Matthew Rosen and CFO Kevin Dotts will host a conference call today to discuss the Company’s financial results, followed by a question and answer period.

Adjusted EBITDA provides an adjusted view of EBITDA that takes into account certain significant non-recurring transactions, if any, such as impairment losses and expenses associated with pending acquisitions, which vary significantly between periods and are not recurring in nature, as well as certain recurring non-cash charges such as changes in fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities and stock-based compensation. The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a measure of the Company’s operational and financial progress that corresponds with the measurements used by management as a basis for allocating resources and making other operating decisions. Although the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as one of several financial measures to assess its operating performance, its use is limited as it excludes certain significant operating expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor have they been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the non-GAAP measurements in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measurement, which can be viewed under the heading “Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA,” immediately following the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this press release.\nFUSION CONNECT, INC.
