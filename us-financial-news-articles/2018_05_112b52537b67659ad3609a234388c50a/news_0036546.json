The #BRRRT was meant to suggest the sound of Gatling gun fire.\nThe tweet sought to link, however awkwardly, the war to a blithe Internet debate over an audio file circulating online that listeners alternatively think sounds like the words “Laurel” or “Yanny.”\nWired magazine has reported that the audio file was posted by high school students on May 11.\nAfter questions at a Pentagon briefing about whether the tweet was appropriate, the Air Force deleted it and expressed regrets for the poor attempt at humor.\n“We apologize for the earlier tweet regarding the A-10. It was made in poor taste and we are addressing it internally. It has since been removed,” it said.
