Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n—Two-man wedge blocks have been eliminated, along with “jump-set/attack” blocks.\n—There is no requirement for the kickoff returner to down the ball in the end zone. Instead, it will be an automatic touchback.\nThe NFL owners also expanded reviewable plays to include disqualification of players and approved ejection standards to go along with the “use of the helmet” rule. According to the new rule, ejection is possible if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent, provided the contact is clearly avoidable.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T06:11:24.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
