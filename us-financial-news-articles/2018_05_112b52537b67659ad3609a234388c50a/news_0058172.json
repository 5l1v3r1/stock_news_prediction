REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\nThe leaders of the two anti-establishment parties trying to field a government, the far-right League and the 5-Star Movement, accused President Sergio Mattarella of betraying the constitution and demanded a new vote as soon as possible.\nPrime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte gave up on efforts to form a government after the head of state refused to endorse 81-year-old economist Paolo Savona, a vocal critic of the euro and the European Union, to the pivotal economy post.\n“I have agreed and accepted all the nominations, except that of the minister of economy,” Mattarella said in a sombre, televised speech.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\n“In a democracy, if we are still in democracy, there’s only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say,” Salvini said in a fiery speech to supporters in central Italy.\n“I was informed of the request by the political parties to hold an early election. I will evaluate that request in the coming hours, and I will take an initiative,” Mattarella said.\nAfter speaking, Mattarella summoned former International Monetary Fund senior official Carlo Cottarelli for a Monday morning meeting — an indication he may be considering asking him to head a government of unelected technocrats.\nHe would be a calming choice for the financial markets, who were spooked by Savona’s criticism of the euro and German economic policy.

But his critical stance on the euro has been the focus of concern.\nIn Sunday’s statement Savona did not mention his opinions on the euro, but more than 70 slides outlining a “plan B” for Italy’s exit from the euro, co-authored by Savona in 2015 with a dozen others, circulated on social media.
