(NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $3.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This result compares with $23.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\n“We are well-positioned for a solid year as our service territory continues to experience a steady improvement in economic conditions and solid customer growth,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt , citing 1.7 percent customer growth and metropolitan Phoenix being on pace for the most home sales in any first-quarter period since the great recession officially started in December 2007.\n“Clearly, Arizona and the Phoenix metropolitan area continue to be attractive places to live and do business. Arizona’s population surpassed 7 million in 2017, and Maricopa County – home to 70 percent of our customers – has been ranked as the fastest growing county in the nation for the past two years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.”\nThe 2018 first-quarter results were negatively impacted by the following factors compared to the same period in 2017:\nThe effects of federal corporate tax cuts, including passing subsequent savings directly back to customers, reduced earnings by $0.20 per share, driven by the timing difference between customer refunds and income tax expense. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.18 per share compared with the prior-year period. The increased costs were primarily due to higher planned outage costs, including at the Four Corners Power Plant to install added emission controls. Other operating expenses, including higher depreciation and amortization and increased taxes other than income taxes, reduced results by $0.19 per share compared with the prior-year period, largely related to changes in rates and increased plant in service. The effects of weather variations negatively impacted earnings by $0.09 per share compared to the year-ago period. First-quarter 2018 residential heating degree-days (a measure of the effects of weather) were 26 percent lower than in the 2017 first quarter and 30 percent below 10-year historical averages. Commercial cooling degree-days were 52 percent lower in the quarter versus the year-ago period and 23 percent lower than normal.\nThese factors were offset in part by the following positive items:\nThe Company’s 2017 regulatory settlement, which included APS’s first retail base rate increase in five years, improved earnings by $0.20 per share. The settlement became effective Aug. 19, 2017. Retail electricity sales increased results $0.08 per share due in part to higher retail revenue from customer growth, as well as higher average effective prices due to customer usage patterns and related pricing. Transmission revenues, excluding tax refund effects, improved earnings $0.09 per share. Adoption of new accounting guidance and strong market returns for pension and other post-retirement benefits positively impacted results by $0.05 per share. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, contributed $0.02 per share. The net effect of miscellaneous items increased earnings $0.04 per share.\nFinancial Outlook\nFor 2018, the Company continues to expect its consolidated earnings guidance will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per diluted share, and expects to achieve a consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5 percent.\nKey factors and assumptions underlying the 2018 outlook can be found in the first-quarter 2018 earnings presentation slides on the Company’s website at pinnaclewest.com/investors .\nConference Call and Webcast\nPinnacle West invites interested parties to listen to the live webcast of management’s conference call to discuss the Company’s 2018 first-quarter results, as well as recent developments, at noon ET (9 a.m. Arizona time) today, May 2.
