The Australian was classified seventh.\nHome hero Fernando Alonso started the weekend a morale-boosting sixth, behind Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen, with his McLaren displaying a heavily-revised three-pronged nose.\nWilliams had another trying session as Polish reserve Robert Kubica took part in a race weekend for the first time since 2010, three months before he suffered serious injuries in a rally crash.\nThe former race winner was 19th, in 1:21.510, but faster than teenage Canadian team mate Lance Stroll in last place on the timesheets with a best of 1:22.756 after an off into the gravel.\n“Unbelievable how bad the balance is,” Stroll complained over the radio.\nKubica was replacing Russian rookie Sergey Sirotkin, who returns for second practice and the race but has a three-place grid penalty.
