If there are any concerns, it's that humans should be worried about beings \"that are similar to yourself\" and share goals. Cooperation could result, or it could go to an \"extreme form of competition\", which would be war, he said.\nIn 1997, Schmidhuber was involved in publishing a study on Long Short Term Memory, a technique which ultimately laid the groundwork for the memory functions of AI today.\nAIs of the future will mostly be interested in other AIs, however, Schmidhuber predicted. \"We already have AIs in our labs that invent their own goals and don't just slavishly imitate what humans tell them,\" he said.\nAccording to Schmidhuber, about 95 percent of all AI research is about enhancing the human life by making humans live longer, healthier and happier. While he acknowledged that the remaining five percent is used on military research, there is still no reason to worry.\n\"In principle, you shouldn't worry about that because the profits are in selling to you an AI that is good for you,\" the scientist said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T08:40:22.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
