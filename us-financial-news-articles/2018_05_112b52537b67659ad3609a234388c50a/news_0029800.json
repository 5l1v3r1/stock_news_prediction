Now in a new location on the Duke Raleigh Hospital campus, Hey Clinic is the only orthopedic clinic in North Carolina offering the EOS ® technology.\nAccording to CEO Lloyd Hey, MD, MS, “Hey Clinic is a full service orthopedic clinic dedicated to compassionate, conservative and lifelong care for scoliosis and spine patients at every age and stage. Providing innovative and safe technology such as the EOS ® imaging System is part of our core commitment to offer each patient the highest level of precision medicine possible.”\nDeveloped based on Nobel Prize-winning research, the EOS ® system is a unique combination of low-dose X-ray imaging technology, software and services used throughout treatment for skeletal conditions, particularly those affecting the spine, hip and knee. Patients receive a radiation dose that is two to three times less than a general X-ray and 20 times less than basic CT scans. Reducing radiation exposure reduces the risk of future cancers, particularly in children with deformities that require frequent imaging.\nIn addition to low-dose radiation, EOS ® technology provides highly accurate images that are consistent in scale, with no magnification or distortion. In less than 20 seconds, an EOS ® exam simultaneously captures two full body, weight-bearing images of the skeletal system that can be processed with the system’s SterEOS ® software to produce a 2D or 3D model of the patient’s spine or lower limbs. These models provide precise anatomical detail to better assist doctors in diagnosing, treating and monitoring patients with spine disorders.\nThe models also help educate patients and families so they can make informed treatment choices. Dealing with spine deformities and disorders can be challenging, especially for parents making decisions for their children. Hey Clinic offers personalized attention for every patient, including various conservative treatment options, and considers education an essential element of its approach to compassionate, lifelong care. The EOS ® system complements this approach by allowing low-dose scanning and 3D images to review patient progress and determine next steps.\n“Each life is precious and deserves access to safe, state-of-the-art medical care,” said Dr. Hey. “The Hey Clinic team is extremely excited to offer the cutting-edge EOS ® technology to patients in our community and throughout the region.”\nAbout Dr. Hey\nDr. Hey is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon with more than 20 years’ experience treating adult and pediatric spinal disorders and deformities. Aspiring to be a surgeon following his own traumatic leg injury as a teenager, he graduated from Harvard Medical School and completed a Pediatric Orthopaedic Fellowship with Boston Children’s Hospital. He also has a degree in mechanical engineering from MIT. Offering a variety of conservative treatment options for scoliosis and kyphosis patients, Dr. Hey has performed more than 6,000 spine surgeries.\nAbout Hey Clinic\nOpening in 2005, Hey Clinic is a full service orthopedic clinic offering unmatched experience, safety and compassionate care for scoliosis and spine conditions in one convenient location. The clinic serves patients of all ages with an array of treatments ranging from conservative care with custom 3D-fitted bracing and physical therapy, to surgery when necessary. One of the highest-rated orthopedic clinics in the Raleigh area, Hey Clinic maintains a strong focus on quality improvement and patient safety, utilizing in-house-created checklist software in the operating room and clinical settings to support its commitment to precision medical care.
