(Nasdaq:VTSI) (the “Company”), a global provider of simulators for the law enforcement, military, educational and commercial markets, today announced its financial results for the first quarter The financial statements are available on VirTra’s website and here .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights: Q1 2018 Q1 2017 % Δ Revenues $3.2M $4.2M (22.9)% Gross Profit $2.2M $2.4M (8.7)% Gross Margin 68.4 % 57.7 % +1,063 bps Net Income (Loss) $(0.1)M $0.4M (121.3)% Diluted EPS $(0.01) $0.05 (120.0)% Business and Financial Highlights:\nGenerated a record $8.6 million in bookings in the first quarter of 2018. Received a new $1.25 million contract early in the second quarter for training simulators from the United States Department of State. Gross profit margin of 68.4% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 57.7% in the year ago period. VirTra’s backlog as of March 31, 2018, was approximately $8.3 million.\n“VirTra generated a record level of bookings in the first quarter, demonstrating strong execution by our expanded and improved sales organization and the growing demand from law enforcement professionals around the world for our products,” commented Bob Ferris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VirTra. “However, a large portion of these orders were booked too late in the quarter to convert to revenue, and instead have created a meaningful backlog to be filled during 2018. The $8.3 million backlog, combined with the $3.2 million in recognized revenue and a $1.25 million order secured early in the second quarter, represents a strong start to 2018 and provides confidence that this will be another year of growth. In the aggregate, this represents more than $12.5 million in revenue and potential revenue, approaching the $16.5 million in recognized revenue for all of 2017.”\n“I am encouraged by our sales pipeline and the strong performance in closing bookings during the first quarter,” continued Mr. Ferris. “Our margin for the quarter was boosted based on deliveries of higher margin products to customers and some improvements in production methods. However, our operating expenses for the first quarter absorbed many one-time costs, totaling $132,000, which were directly related to our qualification and completion of our Regulation A+ offering, completion of SEC registration, and Nasdaq listing.”\n“The market for simulators to help train the police, military personnel and civilians is robust. With growing demand, accelerating adoption of simulation training as a way to improve skills and reduce costs, we are positioned for an outstanding 2018,” concluded Mr. Ferris. “The Board of Directors, management and the entire VirTra team are committed to serving our worldwide customers and creating sustainable value for our shareholders, and I am increasingly optimistic about the future of VirTra.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nTotal revenues were $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 22.9%. The year-over-year decrease was due to the receipt of contracts late in the quarter, resulting in lower deliveries of simulators and accessories and consequentially not being able to recognize revenue in the current period, partially offset by increased sales of scenarios and warranties.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s backlog was approximately $8.3 million. The Company’s backlog consists of orders (all products and services, including extended warranties) for which a signed purchase order is in place but delivery is scheduled for a future date or has not yet been scheduled. Management expects the majority of the backlog received in the first quarter to be converted to revenue during 2018 with the exception of the extended warranties which will convert to revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the warranty period ranging between 1-5 years.\nGross profit was $2.2 million, or 68.4% gross profit margin, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to gross profit of $2.4 million, or 57.7% gross profit margin, for the first quarter of 2017, a gross profit decrease of 8.7% but a gross margin improvement of 1,063 basis points. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to a reduction in the cost of the Company’s machine shop manufacturing system and product components and increases in the sales mix of higher margin products, combined with a reduction in material costs due to favorable pricing of raw materials and systems components in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nOperating expense was $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.0 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of $419,559. SG&A increases resulted from expanding staffing levels and increases in payroll and benefit costs, professional services increases in annual audit, accounting and legal fees, public company expense and other fees, licenses, subscriptions and professional services. The year-over-year increase in professional services included approximately $132,000 of non-recurring legal and public company expense directly related to the Company’s qualification and conclusion of its Regulation A+ offering, completion of SEC registration, and Nasdaq listing.\nInclusive of the $132,000 in non-recurring legal and public company costs, VirTra’s loss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $158,000 compared to income from operations of $474,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Income tax benefit was $29,194 compared to income tax expense of $78,000 for the same period in 2017, an increase of 137%. In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company made updates to provisional estimates for the deferred taxes of the Company based on new information obtained during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and re-measured the updated provision estimates using the new effective tax rate under the Tax Act.\nInclusive of the $132,000 in non-recurring legal and public company costs, Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $85,787, or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $402,000, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, for the prior year’s first quarter.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nStockholders’ equity decreased to $10.3 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.4 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2017. The Company had essentially no outstanding bank debt at March 31, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a first quarter 2018 results and business update investor conference call and webcast on Monday, May 14, 2018.
