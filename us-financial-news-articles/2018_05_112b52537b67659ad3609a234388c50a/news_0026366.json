The property was a build-to-suit for Pinnacle Orthopaedics (“Pinnacle”), who anchors the building. The facility contains Pinnacle’s 10,000 square-foot accredited ambulatory surgery center (ASC) with two operating rooms which allows patients to have routine, outpatient, and pain management procedures done to avoid being admitted to a hospital. In addition to the surgery center, there is an MRI suite, and a fully staffed clinic with Physicians and Physical Therapists.\n“When our building partnership decided to sell, our practice, Pinnacle Orthopaedics, was attracted to Montecito because of its experience in acquiring, investing and managing orthopaedic specialty practices around the country. We look forward in being a part of this successful team.” – Pinnacle Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine\nOther tenants of the building include Vascular Surgical Associates and Advanced Dental Restorations, consuming approximately 20% of the square footage.\n“This is the second asset we’ve acquired in the Atlanta market in the last two months,” said Chip Conk, CEO of Montecito Medical. “Pinnacle is a fantastic addition to our growing portfolio and we look forward to growing our presence in the surrounding area.”\nPinnacle Orthopaedics has been a dominant provider of orthopaedic services in North Atlanta for over 50 years. The group is very involved in the community and acts as the team physician for local high schools, colleges and athletic clubs.\nThe practice consists of 16 physicians, 10 physician assistants, 17 physical and occupational therapists, and a host of administrative staff, and has five locations throughout North Atlanta with many of the providers on staff at WellStar health system hospitals, most notably WellStar Kennestone hospital 11-miles to the south. The 16 specialists cover the entire spectrum of musculoskeletal care both operative and non-operative including hand, foot and ankle, trauma and fractures, joint replacements and reconstruction, limb lengthening and deformity repair, spine, pain management and sports medicine.\nThe Vascular Surgical Associates consists of 11 board certified vascular surgeons, who treat a wide range of vascular disorders.
