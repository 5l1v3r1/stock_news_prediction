Wall Street ended higher on Friday on the back of healthcare stocks after U.S. President Donald Trump blasted high drug prices but avoided taking aggressive measures to cut them. The local share price index futures rose 0.07 pct or 4 points to 6,100, a 16.2-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark fell 0.04 percent on Friday.
