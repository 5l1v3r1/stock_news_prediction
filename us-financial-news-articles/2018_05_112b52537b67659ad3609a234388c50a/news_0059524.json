The fifth annual D CEO Mergers and Acquisitions Awards recognizes companies and dealmakers within its metropolitan area that were involved in some of the most outstanding business transactions.\nThis year's M&A Deal of the Year award was presented to dealmaker Derek Woodworth , Managing Director at Allegiance Capital, for the sale of Healthy Natural, Inc. to Rosewood Private Investments .\n\"I was honored to have been named a Finalist in a category filled with impressive dealmakers and peer investment banks in the region,\" said Woodworth. The transaction was a divestiture from RiceBran Technologies , which utilized the proceeds for growth capital while securing Healthy Natural jobs in the Dallas market. \"The transaction was challenging due to an 80% customer concentration,\" Woodworth continued. \"But, through our process , we were able to source the right strategic partner, Rosewood Investment Partners, a Dallas-based family office with a platform investment in the category.\"\nConnie Mahmood , Co-Founder of Allegiance Capital added, \"I am very proud that Allegiance Capital and Derek Woodworth are being recognized for attaining the highest levels of achievement within the M&A community.
