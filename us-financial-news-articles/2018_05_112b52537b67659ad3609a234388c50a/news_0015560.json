condensed consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures by financial statement line items that exclude the effects of stock-based compensation, depreciation, restructuring costs and other expenses that we believe do not reflect our core operating performance. Our key non-GAAP liquidity and performance measures include adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss), see definitions of such below. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) as key measures to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operating plans. We believe excluding those expenses inherent in calculating adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as it does for our management and board of directors. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, depreciation, restructuring costs, other income (expense), net, interest expense and income tax expense. Restructuring costs relate to an effort in the first quarter of 2018 to reduce headcount and sublease office space to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) (historical methodology)\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) historically consisted of net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, depreciation, restructuring costs not anticipated to be paid in cash during the period (for more information about restructuring costs, please refer to description in adjusted EBITDA above), amortization of debt issuance costs and non-cash income tax expense. We exclude the non-cash portion of income taxes because of our ability to offset a substantial portion of future income tax liabilities by utilizing our deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal research and experimentation credit carryforwards.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) (new methodology)\nWe have redefined non-GAAP net income (loss) to consist of net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, depreciation, restructuring costs (for more information about restructuring costs, please refer to description in adjusted EBITDA above), amortization of debt issuance costs and non-cash income tax expense. We exclude the non-cash portion of income taxes because of our ability to offset a substantial portion of future income tax liabilities by utilizing our deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal research and experimentation credit carryforwards. We have added back all of the net restructuring costs, whether or not cash was paid during the period, because of the non-recurring nature of restructuring costs. By better reflecting our future operating performance we believe this presentation will enhance comparability of our operating results.\nIMPINJ, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(in thousands, except percentages, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Gross profit $ 11,762 $ 16,768 Adjustments: Depreciation 500 385 Stock-based compensation 83 46 Non-GAAP Gross profit $ 12,345 $ 17,199 GAAP Gross margin 46.9 % 52.9 % Adjustments: Depreciation 2.0 % 1.2 % Stock-based compensation 0.3 % 0.1 % Non-GAAP Gross margin 49.2 % 54.2 % GAAP Research and development expense $ 8,003 $ 7,343 Adjustments: Depreciation (385 ) (306 ) Stock-based compensation (759 ) (483 ) Non-GAAP Research and development expense $ 6,859 $ 6,554 GAAP Sales and marketing expense $ 8,859 $ 7,336 Adjustments: Depreciation (129 ) (119 ) Stock-based compensation (757 ) (607 ) Non-GAAP Sales and marketing expense $ 7,973 $ 6,610 GAAP General and administrative expense $ 5,225 $ 4,087 Adjustments: Depreciation (106 ) (64 ) Stock-based compensation (466 ) (234 ) Non-GAAP General and administrative expense $ 4,653 $ 3,789 GAAP Total operating expense $ 26,014 $ 18,766 Adjustments: Depreciation (620 ) (489 ) Stock-based compensation (1,982 ) (1,324 ) Restructuring costs (3,927 ) — Non-GAAP Total operating expense $ 19,485 $ 16,953\nIMPINJ, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(in thousands, except per share data, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Net loss $ (14,442 ) $ (2,160 ) Adjustments: Depreciation 1,120 874 Stock-based compensation 2,065 1,370 Other (income) expense, net (90 ) (269 ) Interest expense 229 374 Income tax expense 51 57 Restructuring costs 3,927 — Adjusted EBITDA $ (7,140 ) $ 246 Reconciliation based on historical methodology GAAP Net loss $ (14,442 ) $ (2,160 ) Adjustments: Depreciation 1,120 874 Stock-based compensation 2,065 1,370 Amortization of debt issuance costs 21 23 Non-cash income tax expense 16 22 Restructuring costs not paid in cash in period presented 3,184 — Non-GAAP Net income (loss) $ (8,036 ) $ 129 Non-GAAP Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ (0.38 ) $ 0.01 Diluted $ (0.38 ) $ 0.01 Reconciliation based on new methodology GAAP Net loss $ (14,442 ) $ (2,160 ) Adjustments: Depreciation 1,120 874 Stock-based compensation 2,065 1,370 Amortization of debt issuance costs 21 23 Non-cash income tax expense 16 22 Restructuring costs 3,927 — Non-GAAP Net income (loss) $ (7,293 ) $ 129 Non-GAAP Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ (0.35 ) $ 0.01 Diluted $ (0.35 ) $ 0.01\nIMPINJ, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(in thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP and non-GAAP Weighted-average shares — basic 21,125 20,344 GAAP Weighted-average shares — diluted 21,125 20,344 Adjustments: Effects of dilutive securities Unvested shares of common stock subject to repurchase — 100 Stock awards — 1,244 Non-GAAP Weighted-average shares — diluted 21,125 21,688\nIMPINJ, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP FINANCIAL OUTLOOK TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL OUTLOOK\n(in thousands, except per share data, unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 GAAP Net loss $ (11,350 ) Adjustments: Forecasted Depreciation 1,550 Forecasted Stock-based compensation 2,500 Forecasted Other (income) expense, net (90 ) Forecasted Interest expense 340 Forecasted Income tax expense 50 Adjusted EBITDA $ (7,000 ) GAAP Net loss $ (11,350 ) Adjustments: Forecasted Depreciation 1,550 Forecasted Stock-based compensation 2,500 Forecasted Amortization of debt issuance costs 25 Forecasted Non-cash income tax expense 25 Non-GAAP Net loss $ (7,250 ) Non-GAAP Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (0.34 ) Weighted-average shares — basic and diluted 21,450\nSource:Impinj, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://investor.impinj.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=246148&p=irol-irhome", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4f56342b-7f7a-4699-83ff-483fa06ae2d6"], "published": "2018-05-08T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T23:31:59.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
