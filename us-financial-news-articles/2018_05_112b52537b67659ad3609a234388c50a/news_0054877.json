Italy and Greece, which abstained, said the deal on capital rules should be matched by an agreement on sharing banking risk by June.\nItaly’s position, although in line with past statements, was partly dictated by the fact that it has yet to form a government after inconclusive elections in March.\nFAVOURABLE TREATMENT Under the deal, the euro zone’s agency for troubled banks, the Single Resolution Board, will be given a clearer mandate to set the level of capital buffers that banks should hold against the risk of failure.\nThe so-called Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), which introduces into EU legislation the global standard known as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC), will be set at 8 percent of large banks’ total liabilities and own funds.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The SRB will, however, be able to require higher buffers for banks it deems insufficiently safe, or a lower buffer for better capitalised institutions.\nMinisters agreed on a more favourable capital treatment for large banks in countries that belong to the bloc’s banking union, such as France’s BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), Netherlands’ ING ( INGA.AS ) and Italy’s Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ), as their exposure to other countries in the bloc will be treated as a safer domestic exposure.\nThe agreement “will allow our banks to better finance households and firms in France and in Europe,” the French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.\nHowever, Britain’s finance minister Philip Hammond and ministers from smaller EU states said that departure from global standards could heighten risk.\nThe new rules would also require large foreign banks to set up intermediate parent undertakings (IPUs) that would bring their EU operations under a single holding company. The move effectively mirrors U.S. rules and is seen as crucial to protecting the bloc’s financial stability against risks posed by major banks.\nSHARING RISKS In a minor concession to reluctant states, ministers reiterated their intent to reach an agreement on a state-funded backstop for the euro zone’s bank-funded Single Resolution Fund.\nThe fund is currently equipped with 17 billion euros ($19.9 billion), but that is not considered enough to cope with a larger banking crisis.\nThe backstop is expected to be provided by the euro zone’s state-backed bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.\nAnother measure of risk sharing, a common insurance of covered bank deposits, is still far from being agreed, despite being a pillar of the banking union, the EU’s flagship project to strengthen its banking sector after years of crisis.\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:01:32.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
