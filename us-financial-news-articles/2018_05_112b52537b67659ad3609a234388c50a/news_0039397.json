He's become the face of Uber's turnaround in the months since, promising to deliver better rides for users and better working conditions for drivers.\n\"Moving forward, it's time to move in a new direction. And I want you to know just how excited I am to write Uber's next chapter,\" Khosrowshahi says in the longer, 60-second commercial.\nKhosrowshahi's had to battle back from the days of the #DeleteUber movement, that Lyft executives have said contributed to one of the rival ride-hailing service's biggest growth weeks in company history.\nLyft earlier this week said it now claims more than a third of the U.S. ride-hailing market .\nKhosrowshahi has prioritized ride safety, worker rights and better public relations since taking over.
