(NYSE: GPS) today reported first quarter fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share of $0.42 compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.36 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The company also affirmed its full-year diluted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.70.\n“We are pleased to have delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp growth, despite the expected challenges at Gap brand,” said Art Peck, president and chief executive officer, Gap Inc. “Our balanced growth strategy provides the right foundation to differentiate our portfolio of brands in this retail environment, with strategic investments in value, active and digital fueled by productivity opportunities unique to our scaled operating platform.”\n“Despite the pressures we faced in the first quarter, we are affirming our full-year guidance, reflecting our confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the business as well as the benefits of executing against our balanced growth strategy,” said Teri List-Stoll, executive vice president and chief financial officer, Gap Inc.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Comparable Sales Results\nDue to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017, comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 are compared with the 13-week period ended May 6, 2017. On this basis, the company’s first quarter comparable sales increased 1% compared with a 2% increase last year. Comparable sales by global brand for the first quarter were as follows:\nOld Navy Global: positive 3% versus positive 8% last year Gap Global: negative 4% versus negative 4% last year Banana Republic Global: positive 3% versus negative 4% last year\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement – Revenue Recognition\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606. The adoption of this standard has a significant impact on the presentations of certain line items of the Consolidated Statements of Income, but does not have a material impact to net income. The most significant changes are the reclassifications from operating expenses to net sales of income from revenue sharing associated with the company’s credit card programs, as well as reclassifications from cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses to net sales of reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with the company’s credit card programs.\nThe company has adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption resulted in an increase of $141 million to net sales, an increase of $50 million to cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses, and an increase of $92 million to operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. There is not a material impact from the company’s adoption on operating income, net income or earnings per share.\nIn accordance with the company’s adoption of the standard on a modified retrospective basis, financial information prior to fiscal 2018 will not be recast. The summary below provides financial measures with and without the impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.\nFor the first quarter ended May 5, 2018:\nNet sales were $3.8 billion, an increase of 10% compared with last year. Excluding the impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, net sales increased 6% compared with last year. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars positively impacted the company’s net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 by about $40 million. First quarter net sales details appear in the tables at the end of this press release. Gross profit was $1.43 billion, an increase of 10% compared with last year. Excluding the impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, gross profit increased about 3% compared with last year. Gross margin was 37.7%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared with last year. Excluding the impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, gross margin was 36.7%, a decrease of 120 basis points compared with last year, largely due to the Gap Brand. Operating margin was 6.1%, a decrease of 130 basis points compared with last year. Excluding the impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, operating margin was 6.3%, a decrease of 110 basis points compared with last year. The effective tax rate was 25.1% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $0.42 compared to $0.36 last year. The company noted diluted earnings per share includes a positive impact from the calendar shift created by the 53rd week in fiscal year 2017. The company noted that foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The company repurchased 3.2 million shares for $100 million and ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with 387 million shares outstanding. The company paid a dividend of $0.2425 per share during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, an increase of over 5% compared to last year. In addition, on May 23, 2018, the company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a second quarter dividend of $0.2425 per share.\nThe company ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Year-to-date free cash flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was negative $204 million, which reflects a higher bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from the GAAP financial measure in the tables at the end of this press release.\nFirst quarter fiscal year 2018 capital expenditures were $138 million.\nThe company ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with 3,617 store locations in 45 countries, of which 3,171 were company-operated.\n2018 Outlook\nEarnings per Share\nThe company affirmed its full-year diluted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.70.\nComparable Sales\nThe company continues to expect comparable sales for fiscal year 2018 to be flat to up slightly.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe company continues to expect its fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate to be about 26%.\nShare Repurchases\nThe company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $100 million per quarter through the end of fiscal year 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe company continues to expect capital spending to be approximately $800 million for fiscal year 2018, with a continued focus on transformative infrastructure investments to support its omni-channel and digital strategies, such as information technology and supply chain.\nReal Estate\nThe company continues to expect to open about 25 company-operated stores, net of closures and repositions in fiscal year 2018.

The Gap, Inc. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UNAUDITED FREE CASH FLOW Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results. 13 Weeks Ended ($ in millions) May 5,\n2018\nApril 29,\n2017\nNet cash (used for) provided by operating activities $ (66 ) $ 91 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (138 ) (110 ) Add: Insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment (a) - 14 Free cash flow $ (204 ) $ (5 ) (a) Represents insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment primarily from the fire that occurred on the company-owned distribution center campus in Fishkill, New York on August 29, 2016.
