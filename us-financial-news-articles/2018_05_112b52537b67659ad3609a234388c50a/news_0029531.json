The FDA’s Pre-Submission Program is designed to organize and give guidance and feedback on clinical data and what regulatory pathway should be followed to get market clearance. The focus of the May 9 pre-submission meeting was in discussing the FDA’s feedback on the clinical outcomes and statistical techniques used in reporting the back-pain study.\nUpon reviewing pre-submission information on the ActiPatch® back-pain study ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03240146 ), the FDA provided positive feedback on the clinical results, and guidance on a 510(k) submission to obtain expanded market clearance for over-the-counter (OTC) treatment of musculoskeletal pain. This would make ActiPatch available as a drug-free, safe, pain relief option for the 126 million Americans (one in two adults) who are suffering with some form of musculoskeletal pain. While ActiPatch is already FDA cleared for treatment of pain from knee osteoarthritis (25 million) and plantar fasciitis (1 million annually), expanded market clearance would allow additional products for the back (42 million), neck (19 million), hip (9 million), shoulder (11 million), carpal tunnel (12 million) and many other musculoskeletal complaints.\nThe company was represented by their clinical R&D team comprising: Sree Koneru, Ph.D., VP Product Development, Ian Rawe, Director Clinical Research of BioElectronics, Kenneth McLeod, Ph.D. Director of Clinical Science and Engineering Research, State University of New York at Binghamton and Richard Staelin, Ph.D. Professor Duke University. Dr. Koneru, who led the discussion, expressed confidence in the FDA’s constructive feedback. “We are pleased that the FDA viewed our data and statistical methods favorably. They have provided guidance on how to combine the back-pain study results, along with our previously cleared 510(k), into a single 510(k) submission for obtaining expedited expanded market clearance.”, he said.\nAn additional pre-submission meeting is scheduled with the FDA on May 29 th , 2018 to seek expanded indications in a separate application for OTC treatment of pain and edema following surgical procedures for its RecoveryRx ® medical device.\nAbout BioElectronics Corporation\nBioElectronics Corporation is a leader in non-invasive electroceuticals and the maker of an industry leading family of disposable, drug-free, pain therapy devices: ActiPatch® Therapy, over-the-counter treatment for back pain and other musculoskeletal complaints; RecoveryRx® Devices for chronic and post-operative wound care; Allay® Menstrual Pain Therapy.
