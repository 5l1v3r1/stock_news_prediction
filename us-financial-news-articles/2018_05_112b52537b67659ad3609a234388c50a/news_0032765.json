The mode allows up to 100 online players to battle each other to the death until only one player survives.\nTake-Two had delayed the launch of its highly anticipated Western action-adventure “Red Dead Redemption 2” to Oct. 26, this year.\nThe company forecast first-quarter adjusted revenue of $215 million to $265 million.\nOther game publishers Electronic Arts ( EA.O ) and Activision’s ( ATVI.O ) current-quarter forecast had also come in below Wall Street expectations.\nTake-Two forecast adjusted revenue between $2.67 billion and $2.77 billion for the year ending March 31, 2019.\nU.S. videogame producers are known to typically give outlook below market expectations but almost always beat them.\nTake-Two’s net income fell to $90.9 million, or 77 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended March 31, from $99.3 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.
