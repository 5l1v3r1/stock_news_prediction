The 63-year-old survived a no-confidence vote last June.\n\"We are deeply sorry that there were people who used the PP for self-enrichment,\" party spokesman Pablo Casado told a news conference on Monday, adding that the no-confidence vote was irresponsible and put Spain's economic stability at risk.\nSpanish borrowing costs relative to Germany's rocketed to their widest differential since the start of the year, though they were also hit by concerns over political uncertainty in Italy.\nPressure from opposition Ciudadanos (Citizens), a liberal party ahead in opinion surveys and the most likely to win a snap election, urged Rajoy on Monday to call an early poll, saying his government was weak and tainted by corruption.\nThe Socialists have proposed their leader Pedro Sanchez as a replacement for Rajoy. The party, with just 84 seats in parliament, must get at least 176 votes to carry its proposal.\nLeftist party Podemos, with 67 seats, has said it will support the motion, but that would not be sufficient. The Socialists would also have to seek backing from small regional parties who would attach politically difficult conditions in return for their support such as the freedom of Catalan politicians from custody.\nCiudadanos said on Saturday it would be willing to work with the Socialists to support a neutral candidate to oust Rajoy, whose minority government has been damaged by a crisis sparked by Catalonia's independence vote.\nHowever, Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera said on Monday he was not prepared to seek pacts with \"regional nationalists and populists\" to oust Rajoy and that elections in the autumn would be preferable.\nshow chapters Spain's economic growth providing lot of confidence: Economy minister 12:13 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 01:20", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T09:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T09:33:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
