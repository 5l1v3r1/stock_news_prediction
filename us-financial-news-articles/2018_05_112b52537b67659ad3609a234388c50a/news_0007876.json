In his new role, he will help extend the company’s product vision and lead the growing engineering team to deliver modern data services solutions that eliminate barriers imposed by traditional storage and enable IT organizations to easily and fully leverage their data. Valiveti will report to Datera CEO and Founder Marc Fleischmann.\n“Datera is enabling enterprises to adopt a modern, data-centric approach to orchestrating data and scaling application performance across enterprises and clouds without the limits imposed by storage silos and the constant management they require,” said Fleischmann. “Valiveti’s track record with applications, software and systems that drive today’s enterprises and his proven ability to scale development teams will further extend our leadership in making storage infrastructure effortless and delivering our vision of data without borders.”\nValiveti’s pedigree includes more than two decades of experience delivering industry-leading software products and solutions to power and automate data center operations. He joins Datera from Dell EMC, where he led engineering for the firm’s billion-dollar data protection business, and Symantec, where he served in senior technical and engineering leadership roles in the firm’s storage and availability business. A technical visionary, Valiveti holds multiple patents in the areas of storage virtualization and management software and systems.\n“I am thrilled to be joining Datera at this exciting point in the industry’s evolution and company’s growth,” said Valiveti. “As data centers are reimagined for cloud, I’ve heard time and time again from enterprise customers that there’s a universal need for a data services platform that can orchestrate data at scale. Datera can lead this transformation with highly automated and flexible solutions that will allow IT to operate at the speed of today’s business.”\nSince exiting stealth mode in 2016, Datera has been on a rapid growth trajectory and has received industry recognition for its pioneering approach to application-driven data services. Datera supports a robust set of applications and computing environments including VMware, Kubernetes, OpenStack, CloudStack, Couchbase, Docker, Hortonworks Data Platform, Rancher and MongoDB.\nAbout Datera\nDatera is taking storage into the data era.
