That would appear to include almost every flight United operates domestically, with the exception of transcon service between the two coasts.\nFood isn't the only part of the premium cabin experience affected by the changes. Notable adjustments in the onboard beverage offerings are also being rolled out.\nMore from Chicago Business Journal:\nAmerican Airlines ending unprofitable Chicago-Beijing nonstop service\nUnited Airlines plucks new top PR exec from Obama administration\nUnited Airlines introduces new pet policies after dog died on flight\nAll the changes may fatten United's bottom line and please investors. But the changes also could start to irk high-margin first- and business-class customers and cause defections to competitors on lucrative longer routes.\nThe reduction in food being offered in many instances in first-class and business-class cabins is not insignificant. Hot breakfasts are being replaced on some routes with only fruit plates and muffins, and more substantial lunches are being switched out for wraps and chocolate slabs.\nUnited flight attendant sources also reacted to the changes in the onboard beverage menu.\nGone is Sprite Zero, which sources said is not a great loss, as it was not very popular.\nBut tomato juice, also a goner onboard, is another matter, according to flight attendant sources. The removal of tomato juice — replaced with an extra can of Mr. And Mrs. T Bloody Mary mix — has caused a ruckus among flight attendants.\nNoted one source: \"We are once again in full apology mode now onboard our flights, although the issue (of the disappearing tomato juice) is a more minor one compared to the forced removal of customers or suffocating dogs.\"\nOn the liquor and spirits front, Jim Beam won't be offered. Nor will Courvoisier or Amaretto.\nOne flight attendant noted at least one positive development — the addition of Ghirardelli-branded ice cream toppings on transcon United flights. But even that has a downside, as the quality toppings serve primarily to mask the poor flavor profile of the lower-quality ice cream that was first used by Continental Airlines on flights prior to the merger with United.\nHigh-margin customers who will be most affected by these changes no doubt will not hesitate to voice concerns to management about the changes.\nUnited today indicated the carrier will be carefully monitoring feedback.\nNoted a United spokesman: \"With all of our food offerings, we monitor customer feedback and what they would prefer and adjust accordingly.\"\nUnited Airlines is a unit of United Continental Holdings.", "external_links": ["https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2018/05/03/united-airlines-hires-josh-earnest-as-top-pr-exec.html", "https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2018/05/02/american-airlines-ending-unprofitable-chicago.html", "https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2018/05/01/united-airlines-introduces-new-pet-policies.html"], "published": "2018-05-08T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T20:08:46.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
