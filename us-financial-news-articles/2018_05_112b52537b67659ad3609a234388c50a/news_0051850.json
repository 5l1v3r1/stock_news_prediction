Together they hold a combined 48.2 percent of Gassled.\n“The state has one sidedly reduced tariffs in the middle of the concession period ... by 90 percent,” Thomas K. Svensen, representing the Gassled owners, told the Supreme Court.\n“How much protection does the law give owners?” he asked the five-strong panel.\nThe four investment companies were originally owned by Allianz, UBS, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and France’s Caisse des Depots.\nIn October 2017, UBS and Caisse des Depots said they were selling their stakes to Cape Omega, but they will still be in line for any potential proceeds from a decision in favour of the Gassled partners. They will also help pay legal costs.\nSome of the companies involved have said Norway’s unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt the image of Norway as an investment destination.\nThe government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil , Total, Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell for a total of 32 billion crowns.\nLawyers representing the aggrieved Gassled owners will continue presenting their arguments this week. The Norwegian state will present its arguments next week.\nThe hearing is expected to last eight days.\n$1 = 8.0815 Norwegian crowns Editing by Jason Neely and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:22:41.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
