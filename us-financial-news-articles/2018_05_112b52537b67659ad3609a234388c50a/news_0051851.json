That was far below an average estimate of 38.40 billion rupees from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\nWhile income from operations for the quarter rose 15.9 percent to 912.79 billion rupees, total expenses rose about 19 percent to 876.95 billion rupees.\nTata Motors also suffered a one-off loss of 16.41 billion rupees for undisclosed product development programmes that was part of its work-in-progress capital.\nRetail sales of its Jaguar saloons and Land Rover sport utility vehicles (SUVs) fell 3.8 percent over the period, coming off record sales in 2017, amid tough conditions in Britain due to Brexit uncertainty and a planned diesel tax rise on new cars.\nAbout 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover’s sales in Britain are diesel models, compared with around 45 percent globally.\n$1 = 68.3850 Indian rupees Reporting by Krishna V Kurup in Bengaluru; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/20a877b9-97cc-46ba-af15-ee57a51ec94b.pdf"], "published": "2018-05-23T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:21:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
