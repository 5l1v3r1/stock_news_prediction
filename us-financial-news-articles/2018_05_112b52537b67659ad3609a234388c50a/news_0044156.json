Higher U.S. yields were seen as boosting investment returns for Japanese insurers.\nInvestors locked in gains in the sector, one of the best performers since March as trade war worries had engulfed exporters and others vulnerable to tariff threats.\nBanks shed 0.7 percent, with MUFG falling 1.1 percent.\nDefensive shares also succumbed to profit-taking, with food companies and retailers both falling 0.5 percent.\nMost sectors were down among Topix 33 sector indexes , with only two with strong relations to resources - oil companies and wholesale companies - making substantial gains, thanks to firm energy prices.
