While about one in four of those questioned were fairly interested in news about the upcoming ceremony, 67 percent were not.\nThe royals were most popular in Romania, Saudi Arabia, India and the United States and viewed most negatively in Spain and Argentina.\nThe poll found Harry, 33, and the 92-year-old queen were the most liked of the Windsors, with the prince the favorite among Britons.\nThey were followed by the prince’s elder brother William and his wife Kate, who was the most liked in the United States, while Harry’s father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, had the lowest favourability score.\nThe survey found 29 percent felt favorably about Markle, compared with 10 percent who did not, although more than 60 percent had no opinion or did not know.\n“The royal family’s international reputation is bolstered by the popularity of both the queen and members of the younger generation, which gives it a solid foundation for the future, and reflects the growing profile they have around the world,” said Gideon Skinner from Ipsos MORI.\nThe pollster said it has questioned 20,793 people aged under 65 across 28 countries for the survey.\nReporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
