REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo\nNpower’s first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 43 million euros (38 million pounds), compared with 34 million in the same period last year. It lost 115,000 customers in the period, presentation slides showed, a decline of 2.4 percent.\nAiming to challenge champion British Gas ( CNA.L ), Innogy and SSE in November unveiled plans to merge their UK power and gas retail operations, creating a supply group with 11 billion pounds in combined sales.\nThe deal would rid Innogy of its most problematic unit, which has bled customers over the past few years due to billing issues and ever growing competition in the already tight British energy retail market.\nA week ago, British regulators launched an in-depth investigation into the proposed tie-up, saying it may reduce competition and increase prices for some households. Innogy would hold 34.4 percent in the entity, with SSE owning the rest.\nInnogy, which is subject to break-up plans by parent RWE ( RWEG.DE ) and rival E.ON ( EONGn.DE ), also kept its outlook for the current year, still expecting adjusted EBIT of about 2.7 billion euros and adjusted net profit of more than 1.1 billion.
