I am deeply saddened,” Tabasco state Governor Arturo Nunez told reporters.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Nunez said roads leaving the capital had been closed as part of attempts to catch the perpetrators.\nSo far this year, at least four journalists from states marred by worsening violence and the presence of criminal gangs have been killed in Mexico. Last year, 12 reporters were killed, according to free-speech advocacy group Article 19.\nArticle 19 has said Mexico is the most dangerous country in Latin America for journalists, with the number of killings similar to war zones like Syria.\nA proliferation of violent criminal gangs drove the number of all murders in 2017 to more than 28,000, the highest in records going back to 1997.\nThe spike in violence has battered the popularity of President Enrique Pena Nieto and contributed to support of leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who leads public opinion polls ahead of elections in July.\nReporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Writing by Michael O'Boyle; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T23:18:18.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
