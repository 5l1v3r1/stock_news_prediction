Investments in mining exploration, helped by rising mineral prices, rose to $300 million last year, up from $148 million in 2016, according to official data.\nBut a lack of clarity on environmental rules, overlapping federal and local taxes, and regulations that vary from province to province continue to loom over proposed mines.\nMeilan, Argentina’s top mining official, acknowledged more must be done to rebuild investor trust in an industry where it can take decades to recover an investment.\nHe said the industry might bounce back if Congress approves an agreement Macri’s government signed with the country’s main mining provinces to unify industry regulations — a feat that would remove a key source of confusion for miners.\nBut the agreement, which was forged late last year, has not yet been debated by lawmakers and could run into opposition in the lower house, where the governing coalition lacks a majority.\n“Argentina as a whole has not yet shown a clear direction regarding mining,” an industry source who asked not to be identified said.\nA law aimed at preserving glaciers in the Andes, home to a large part of Argentina’s mineral wealth, has also helped keep some large projects on ice.\nPassed in 2010, rules on how the law will work still have not been written, raising questions over how it might impact projects in the highlands such as Glencore’s El Pachon, McEwen Mining Inc’s Los Azules and Yamana Gold’s Agua Rica.\nLast week the environment minister presented a survey it completed on the country’s glaciers and surrounding areas, and Congress must now define how it will be used.\n“There are a lot of projects already considered feasible — gold, copper, silver — that will be affected by the (glacier) law,” Marcelo Alvarez, the head of Argentina’s mining chamber said.
