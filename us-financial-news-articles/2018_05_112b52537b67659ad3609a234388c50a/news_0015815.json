All the deals are dependent on U.S. licences because of the heavy use of U.S. parts in commercial planes.\n“We’re carefully analysing the announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with sanctions and export control regulations,” Airbus communications chief Rainer Ohler said.\n“This will take some time,” he added.
