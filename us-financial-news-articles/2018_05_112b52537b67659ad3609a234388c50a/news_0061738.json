Freddy Galvis had a two-run home run, and A.J. Ellis hit a solo shot.\nCraig Stammen (2-0) got the win with 1 2/3 scoreless innings of relief. Daniel Hudson (1-1) was stuck with the loss after Matt Szczur singled against him and scored the go-ahead run on a Jose Pirela single off Scott Alexander in the seventh.\nThe resurgent Dodgers entered the game on a modest three-game winning streak, but had won seven of their last eight before the Padres beat them for the third time in eight tries this season.\nThe Dodgers got things going early on Chris Taylor’s home run to lead off the game against Padres starter Jordan Lyles. It was Taylor’s seventh home run of the season and third of the leadoff variety.\nThe Padres started the back-and-forth affair when Galvis hit his two-run home run off Dodgers starter Alex Wood, his second of the year.\nThe Dodgers moved back on top 4-2 with three runs in the fourth inning, the first coming on Justin Turner’s first home run. The Dodgers also scored in the inning on an RBI single from Logan Forsythe and a run-scoring groundout from Joc Pederson.\nThe Padres pulled to within a run in the fifth on a home run by the former Dodger Ellis, his first, but the Dodgers got the run back in the bottom of the inning after a bases-loaded walk to Cody Bellinger. Ellis has 12 of his 44 career home runs at Dodger Stadium.\nVillanueva knocked Wood from the game in the sixth inning after his two-run home run tied the score. His eighth-inning home run came against Josh Fields.\nWood gave up five runs on six hits over 5 1/3 innings, the most runs he has given up in a game since April 11 when the Oakland A’s rocked him for seven. Lyles gave up five runs on seven hits over 4 2/3 innings in the shortest of his four starts since moving over from the bullpen.\nThe Padres bullpen held the Dodgers scoreless over the final 4 1/3 innings, with Brad Hand pitching the ninth inning for his 16th save.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-27T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:30:30.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
