The latter no longer has gold assets but historically was a bullion producer.\nThe companies said it was the first class-action settlement in South Africa involving so many companies and claimants.\n“The settlement is the product of commercial negotiation and compromise, but we believe this is a beneficial settlement,” said Carina du Toit, a lawyer with the Legal Resources Centre, one of the law groups representing the workers.\nAbrahams Kiewitz Inc and Richard Spoor Attorneys also represented the mine workers.\n“This is an historic settlement, resulting from three years of extensive negotiations,” a statement by the working group on Occupational Lung Disease (OLD), a group put together by the six companies involved, said.\nThe parties said the compromise settlement was preferable for all concerned rather than a lengthy and expensive litigation process, and would enable the claimants to receive compensation and relief for their conditions more quickly.\nThe settlement still needs approval by the Johannesburg High Court before being implemented.
