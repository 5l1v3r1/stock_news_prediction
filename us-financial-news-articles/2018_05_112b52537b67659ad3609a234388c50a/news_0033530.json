Oil Search did not immediately reply to an email requesting comment.\nThe resumption of Kutubu Light crude oil could weigh on premiums of ultra-light crude oil cargoes as there is ample supply in the region, said one Singapore-based trader, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak with media.
