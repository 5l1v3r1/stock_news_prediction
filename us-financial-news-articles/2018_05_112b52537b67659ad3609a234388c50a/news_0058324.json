Two of the sources said that Enel wants 25 billion roubles ($402 million) for the plant, although it was unclear how much Melnichenko has offered.\nBoth Enel Russia, which is selling the asset, and a spokeswoman for Melnichenko declined to comment.\nBerezkin, asked about the Reftinskaya plant on Friday, told reporters that he was interested in a deal.\n“They (Enel) are now in talks with the contender as he offered the best price of the three, but this is not us. But we did not drop out of the process,” Berezkin said without naming the other two companies.\n$1 = 62.1680 roubles Writing by Katya Golubkova, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:32:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
