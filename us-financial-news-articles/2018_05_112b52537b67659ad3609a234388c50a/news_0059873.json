Kyaw Win and the government have also not commented on media reports that he was under investigation by Myanmar’s Anti-Corruption Commission.\nSoe Win joined a Myanmar state-owned bank in the early 1960s before a stint as a trainee at National Westminster Bank and the Bank of England in mid-1970s, according to a biography on the website of the Renaissance Institute.\nSoe Win is a board member of Renaissance, a think-tank that advises the government on economic policy. Myanmar Vigour Co. Ltd., a business advisory agency he founded in 2003, became a member firm of Deloitte in 2015, according to the biography.\nNearly five decades of army rule has left Myanmar mired in poverty and plagued by corruption.\nEconomic growth, while still relatively strong, has slowed along with foreign direct investment since Suu Kyi came to power in 2016.\nApart from criticism over sluggish economic reforms, Suu Kyi has also faced international condemnation for a military operation that has sent nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to neighbouring Bangladesh, according to the United Nations and human rights groups.
