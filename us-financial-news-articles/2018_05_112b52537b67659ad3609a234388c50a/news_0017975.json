Overall the group saw rate increases of around 2 percent in the first quarter of 2018,” it said.\n“During the quarter claims related to natural catastrophes have been only slightly above historical first quarter levels,” it added.\nAfter a record year in 2017 for insurance losses from natural disasters, rates have not risen as much as some insurers had anticipated. Bad weather has continued to hit firms such as U.S. insurer AIG in the first quarter.\nZurich’s life insurance premium sales rose 13 percent like-for-like to $1.25 billion on an annual premium equivalent basis, which takes account of policies with large single payments as well as those with regular annual payments.\nThe new business margin for life insurance was 25.2 percent and the new business value was stable at $273 million, it said.
