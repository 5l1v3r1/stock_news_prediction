For the week, the peso weakened 6.30 percent, and for the first 11 days of May it weakened 12.03 percent.\nOn Thursday, IMF Director Christine Lagarde said she instructed her team to continue discussions toward a fund-supported program for Argentina.\nThe Argentine government has hiked the benchmark interest rate some 1,275 basis points in recent weeks and announced it would seek a so-called \"high access stand-by\" agreement from the IMF to stabilize the country's economy.\nInvestors \"are continuing to unwind their positions (in peso-denominated assets) to dollarize (their portfolios),\" said a Buenos Aires-based trader. \"The central bank had to sell dollars once again, but they were absorbed by the market immediately and the exchange rate didn't fall.\"\nAcross Latin America, some other major markets also saw their currencies weaken.\nIn Brazil, the real currency was trading down 1.53 percent against the dollar. Traders said they were adopting defensive positions ahead of a new presidential election opinion poll.\n\"Markets are hoping for a candidate with a reformist vision rising in the polls, which hasn't happened yet,\" wrote brokerage Advanced Corretora in a report.\nIn Mexico, the peso fell 1.07 percent after Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the nation would not be rushed into a poor North American Free Trade Agreement deal and that plenty of issues with the negotiations were outstanding.
