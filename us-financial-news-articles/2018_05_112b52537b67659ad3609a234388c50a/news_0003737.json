The timing and amounts related to employee equity award settlements are difficult to project and may vary from this estimate. 2018 guidance reflects the sale of the Company’s Oklahoma facilities which closed February 1, 2018. These facilities had annual revenues of approximately $1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $180 million in 2017. 2018 guidance includes an estimated impact of $1.25 earnings per diluted share related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 2018 guidance excludes any acquisitions that have not been completed as of March 31, 2018. 2018 guidance excludes any hurricane insurance recoveries the Company may receive. 2018 guidance excludes any changes in our estimates of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. 2018 guidance excludes the impact of items such as, but not limited to, gains or losses on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs and impairments of long-lived assets.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s views only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAll references to “Company” and “HCA” as used throughout this release refer to HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its affiliates.\nHCA Healthcare, Inc.

We believe net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA are important measures that supplement discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measures to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams. Management and investors review both the overall performance (including net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and GAAP net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc.) and operating performance (Adjusted EBITDA) of our health care facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management and investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year and to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry. It is reasonable to expect that gains on sales of facilities will occur in future periods, but the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our health care facilities and complicate period comparisons of our results of operations and operations comparisons with other health care companies. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. as a measure of operating performance or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Because net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. HCA Healthcare, Inc. Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures 2018 Operating Results Forecast (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) For the Year Ending December 31, 2018 Low High Revenues $ 45,000 $ 46,000 Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc.

(a) The Company does not forecast the impact of items such as, but not limited to, losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs (benefits) and impairments of long-lived assets because the Company does not believe that it can forecast these items with sufficient accuracy. (b) Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that supplements discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams.
