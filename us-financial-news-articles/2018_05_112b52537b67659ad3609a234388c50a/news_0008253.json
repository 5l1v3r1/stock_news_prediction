For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.”\nAmid a social media outcry, West later said on Twitter, “Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will. My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved.”\nThe civil rights group NAACP said in a Twitter response addressed to West, “There is a lot of misinformation out there and we are happy to provide insight. Black people have fought against slavery since we first landed on this continent.” FILE PHOTO: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and musician Kanye West pose for media at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 13, 2016.

I was addicted to opioids.”\nHe said he was given painkillers after undergoing previously unreported liposuction surgery, adding, “I got liposuction, because I didn’t want y’all to call me fat.”\nIn separate video released on Tuesday to match his new single “Ye vs. the People,” West discussed the support he voiced for Trump last week, which caused controversy among many of his fans.\nAsked what he admired about Trump, West told fellow rapper T.I., “the ability to do what no one said you can do, to do the impossible.”\nIn the single, West raps lines like “Make America Great Again had a negative perception/I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant in Los Angeles; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Lisa Shumaker", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T07:08:09.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
