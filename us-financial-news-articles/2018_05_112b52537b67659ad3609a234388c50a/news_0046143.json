One in four staff at the chain is homeless, and customers can pay for meals that homeless people can claim later.\nIt distributed nearly 100,000 items of food last year and engages with more than 300 homeless people per week.\nSocial Bite is one of a growing number of social enterprises in Scotland - businesses that aim to help society as well as making money.\nThe country had 5,600 social enterprises last year, up from 5,199 in 2015, according to campaign group Social Enterprise Scotland.\nThe government has a a 10-year strategy to support social enterprise, including making funding available and expanding education about the sector in schools.\nThe village will be operated in conjunction with Scottish homeless charity Cyrenians, which is assessing applications for residents.\n“The mark of any society is how you look after those who are most excluded. This village says an extraordinary thing about how we all want the world to be,” said Cyrenians chief executive Euan Aitken in a speech marking the opening of the village.\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing by Claire Cozens.
