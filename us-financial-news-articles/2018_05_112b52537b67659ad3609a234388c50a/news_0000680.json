(NASDAQ:FELE) reported first quarter 2018 GAAP fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.45, versus a GAAP fully diluted EPS in the first quarter 2017 of $0.33. First quarter 2018 sales were $295.6 million, compared to 2017 first quarter sales of $220.3 million. First quarter 2018 organic sales increased about 10 percent when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.\nGregg Sengstack, Franklin Electric’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n“We had a strong start to 2018 from both a growth and earnings perspective. Our Water Systems business grew organically by 11 percent on strength in the U.S. and Canada markets and our Fueling Systems business grew organically by 9 percent on broad based strength internationally and in North America. In our Distribution segment, first quarter proforma revenue was down less than 3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017 and ahead of our expectations. Our first quarter operating income grew by 23 percent and our earnings per share grew by 36 percent compared to the first quarter 2017.”\nKey Performance Indicators:\nFor the First Quarter Earnings Before and After Restructuring 2018 2017 Change (in millions) Net Income attributable to FE Co., Inc.

Water Systems sales increased about 3 percent in the quarter due to foreign currency translation.\nWater Systems sales in the U.S. and Canada increased by about 29 percent compared to the first quarter 2017. The impact of foreign currency translation increased sales by about 1 percent. Sales of Pioneer branded dewatering equipment more than doubled in the first quarter when compared to the prior year due to strength in North American oil and gas markets and continued diversification of product sales channels and geographies. Sales of groundwater pumping equipment increased by about 30 percent on stronger residential and agricultural system sales primarily to the Headwater companies, versus the first quarter 2017. Sales of other surface pumping equipment increased by about 10 percent primarily in wastewater products.\nWater Systems sales in markets outside the U.S. and Canada increased by about 3 percent overall. The impact of foreign currency translation increased sales by about 5 percent. International Water Systems sales improved in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, but were offset by lower sales in Brazil and Asia when compared to the first quarter 2017.\nWater Systems operating income was $25.2 million in the first quarter 2018, up $3.8 million versus the first quarter 2017. The increase in operating income is primarily related to higher sales.\nFueling Systems\nFueling Systems sales were $59.4 million in the first quarter 2018, versus the first quarter 2017 sales of $52.7 million. Fueling System sales increased by about 4 percent due to foreign currency translation.\nFueling Systems sales in the U.S. and Canada increased by about 11 percent compared to the first quarter 2017. The increase was broad based and included numerous product categories including fuel management, pumping, piping and containment systems. Outside the U.S. and Canada, Fueling Systems revenues grew by about 16 percent, led by stronger sales in China and Europe, partially offset by lower sales in India.\nFueling Systems operating income was $13.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $11.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating income is primarily related to higher sales.\nDistribution\nDistribution sales were $56.2 million in the first quarter 2018. The Company estimates that compared to the 2017 first quarter, proforma revenue in the distribution segment declined by just under three percent. The Distribution segment recorded an operating loss of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nOverall\nThe Company’s consolidated gross profit was $99.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase from the first quarter of 2017 gross profit of $75.8 million. The gross profit as a percent of net sales was 33.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 versus 34.4 percent during the first quarter 2017. The gross profit increase was primarily due to higher sales. The decline in gross profit margin percentage is primarily due to product and geographic sales mix shifts, as realized sales price offset material cost inflation in the quarter.\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $76.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $57.0 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in SG&A expenses from acquired businesses was $17.7 million. Excluding the acquired entities, the Company’s SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $58.6 million, an increase of about 3 percent from the first quarter 2017.\nThe Company recognized discrete income tax benefits related to certain deferred tax positions in the first quarter of about $5 million which lowered the first quarter effective tax rate to a 9 percent benefit. Consistent with our previous guidance, the Company believes the full year 2018 effective tax rate will be about 15 percent expense on pre-tax earnings.\nCommenting on the outlook, Mr. Sengstack said:\n“Given our strong start to the year in both the Water and Fueling Systems segments, and our better than expected sequential growth in Distribution, we are raising our revenue guidance for 2018. We now believe our organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, will more likely be in the 6 to 8 percent range. This is an increase from the 4 to 5 percent range for Water and Distribution and from the 5 to 7 percent range for Fueling, provided in our previous guidance.\nBased on these higher growth assumptions and resultant earnings, we are raising our full year 2018 estimate for earnings per share to a range of $2.27 to $2.37, an increase from the $2.16 to $2.28 provided in our previous guidance. The discrete tax benefits we realized in the first quarter were planned and included in our previous earnings guidance.”\nA conference call to review earnings and other developments in the business will commence at 9:00 am EDT.
