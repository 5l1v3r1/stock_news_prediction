The board on April 19 approved a fiscal turnaround plan that included pension cuts and labor reforms, which Rossello has said he will refuse to implement.\nThe plan forecasts about $6.7 billion in debt payment ability for Puerto Rico through fiscal year 2023. But Rossello’s proposed budget does not allocate for debt service, while including other expenses that are not in the plan. Among them were $100 million in municipal spending and a reserve fund that is $130 million higher than the one in the plan, according to the board’s letter.\nIf Rossello refuses to implement parts of the plan, the board could sue for enforcement, putting yet another piece of the embattled island’s financial future in the hands of a judge.\nThe board took issue with earlier comments from Puerto Rican officials accusing it of failing to consult with the government on a timeline for budget development.\n“From December 2017 to April 2018, the oversight board shared more than seven letters on the topic with various government officials” and “met in person dozens of times with” officials, the board claimed.\nA government spokesman said Rossello’s administration planned to respond to the letter.\nReporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:31:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
