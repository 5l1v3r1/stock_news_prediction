REUTERS/Hannah Mckay/File Photo Marcio Gomes was the first of the family and friends of people who died in the blaze to pay tribute to a lost loved one - his baby son Logan who was stillborn in hospital hours after his heavily pregnant wife Andreia escaped from the fire.\nOnly a charred, gutted ruin remains of Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey social housing block in a deprived pocket of the rich west London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, since it was engulfed by flames in the middle of the night of June 14, 2017.\nThe Grenfell Tower fire shocked Britain and led to an outpouring of angst over whether poor quality social housing and neglect by the authorities of a deprived, ethnically diverse community had played a part in the tragedy.\nSeparately from the public inquiry, the police are conducting a criminal investigation which could result in charges against organizations or individuals involved in the construction, maintenance or refurbishment of the tower.\nThe inquiry faces the daunting task of establishing the root causes of the fire from eye-witness accounts, videos and photos, expert evidence and the paper trail of the tower’s history since it was built in 1974.\nBut before it delves into the details of what happened, the inquiry wants to give those bereaved by the disaster an opportunity to pay tribute to those they lost by talking about them publicly, or by showing photos or videos if they wish.\nYvette Williams, representing Justice 4 Grenfell, and Clarrie Mendy-Solomon, who lost two family members in the disaster, speak outside a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London, Britain May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls TEARS FOR BABY LOGAN Marcio Gomes, who lived with his wife and two daughters on the 21st floor of the tower, went first with a highly emotional tribute to baby Logan.\nSitting alongside his wife Andreia, Gomes talked about the family’s happiness about the baby they were expecting and recounted how hard he had worked to prepare a nursery for Logan.\nHe spoke briefly about the family’s terrifying escape down the burning tower in the middle of the night, and about the moment in hospital hours later when he was told the baby had been stillborn.\nAt that moment, Andreia was in an induced coma being treated for cyanide poisoning and their two daughters were unconscious.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “I held my son in my arms, hoping it was all a bad dream, wishing, praying for a miracle, that he would open his eyes, move, make a sound,” Gomes said, weeping as he spoke.\nFamily photographs from before and after the tragedy flashed up on a screen, including an ultrasound scan image of unborn Logan in his mother’s womb, and images of him just after his birth, as well as photographs from his funeral.\nOther Grenfell relatives and friends, lawyers and journalists in the hearing room wept as they watched and listened. Logan Gomes had been due to be born on Aug. 21, 2017.\nThe commemoration hearings are expected to last nine days, although the schedule is uncertain as the inquiry has set no time limit for the tributes. They are expected to last between two minutes and over an hour.\nThe oral hearings into the circumstances of the fire will start later, on June 4.\n“In terms of loss of life, the fire was the single greatest tragedy to befall this city since the end of the Second World War,” said the chairman of the inquiry, retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, at the start of Monday’s hearing.\nWhile the official death toll from the fire is 71, the inquiry will commemorate 72 people as it is including Maria del Pilar Burton, a resident of the tower who died in January, having never left hospital since she escaped from the fire.\nAt the start of Monday’s hearing, the bereaved and survivors gathered in the inquiry hearing room, at a conference center in a hotel in Kensington, and stood in silence for 72 seconds to honor each victim.\nEditing by Guy Faulconbridge and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T12:03:32.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
