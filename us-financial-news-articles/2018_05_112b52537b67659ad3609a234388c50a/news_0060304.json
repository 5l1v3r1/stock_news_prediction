The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation that took effect last week left unclear exactly how companies should handle tips that come in from whistleblower hotlines. The stakes are high, Risk & Compliance Journal’s Henry Cutter reports .\nData submitted to whistleblower hotlines may contain sensitive allegations about corporate staff or management, but GDPR left gray areas about how the rules will work in different countries, the scale of penalties for a given violation, and even how to balance individuals’ rights against corporations’ needs, said privacy and compliance experts.\n“It’s a much steeper set of penalties associated with getting it wrong,” said Hilary Wandall, a former chief data-privacy officer at Merck & Co., who is now the head of data governance at TrustArc, a privacy-technology company. Fines can reach 4% of a firm’s annual revenue for certain violations.\nTwenty-eight national agencies will be in charge of enforcement. The regulation allows each country to spell out how the rules will work within its borders on a variety of fronts.\nThe national systems are expected to be similar but differences are likely, leaving it unclear what companies can expect, said John Wilson, chief executive officer at Expolink, a U.K.-based hotline-services company.\nWhat penalties companies should expect for what types of noncompliance—and what areas national authorities will focus on—is another area of uncertainty, said Shon Ramey, general counsel at Navex Global Inc., a compliance-software company that operates whistleblower hotlines for companies.\nFirms will be watching the first enforcement actions to see how seriously each national regulator takes different cases of noncompliance, he said.\nCOMPLIANCE\nThe U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to Bayer AG ’s acquisition of Monsanto Co. after requiring the German company to sell about $9 billion in assets to preserve competition.

Yet risks and challenges continue to multiply and evolve, and management must continually revise strategies in pursuit of organizational goals. Learn how boards are enhancing their risk oversight practices by clarifying and formally approving the organization’s risk appetite — the aggregate level of risk that management is willing to take in pursuit of its strategy.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
