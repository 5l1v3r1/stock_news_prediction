The rise accelerated last year as investors priced in faster rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve, in turn encouraging foreign investors into euro zone bond markets.\nAnalysts say this development, in particular, has boosted demand for peripheral government bonds - coinciding with ratings upgrades and brighter growth prospects.\nSpain’s 10-year bond yield gap over Germany is at 75 basis points, compared with 115 bps at the end of last year .\n“Increased appetite for Spanish bonds shows there’s now a de-correlation of peripheral government bonds from risk assets,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rabobank in London. “Investors are loving the carry story.”\nAnother strategist, who asked not be named, said he suspected that ratings upgrades for Spain may also have encouraged Japanese buying of Spanish bonds.\nS&P Global in March raised Spain’s credit rating to A- from BBB+, citing a positive outlook for the economy and budgetary consolidation, marking the second ratings upgrade of the year .\nFrench bonds, historically a favourite among Japanese investors, are offering a limited yield pick-up, so a diversification into peripheral bonds by foreign investors can be expected, analysts added.\nJapanese investors sold French bonds in March, the data showed.
