This Business Acquisition Report was required to be filed on or before March 7, 2018. The Company had initially considered the transaction to be a reverse takeover for accounting purposes, in which case a report would not be required. On subsequent re-analysis, it was determined that the transaction was not a reverse takeover for accounting purposes and therefore this report is required to be filed. As part of the current filing, the Company has included the audited financial statements of GAFC for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, which were previously filed with the Management Information Circular dated September 1, 2017. Due to a collation error, the auditor’s report filed was not the report for the correct fiscal year. This error has been corrected with the current filing.\nAbout Global Atomic\nGlobal Atomic is a TSX Venture listed company that provides a unique combination of high grade uranium development and cash flowing zinc concentrate production.\nGlobal Atomics’ Uranium Division includes six exploration permits in the Republic of Niger covering an area of approximately 750 km 2 .
