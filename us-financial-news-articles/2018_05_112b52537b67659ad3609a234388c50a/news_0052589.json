The secretion is extracted and bottled.\nOnce collected, the slime is sold to Aden International Co., a Thailand-based business that turns most of it into a powder, which it sells to cosmetics companies in South Korea and the United States, its Chief Executive Voranun Puttarathuvanun said.\nAden International also makes its own face serum using the mucus, which it says is popular in China.\nThe company declined to name its customers.\nVoranun said the best part of the snail slime business was its minimal cost.\n“You don’t even need to buy the snails as they can be collected, especially in the rainy season”, she said of the land snails from the Achatina genus.\nTawatchai said his snails earn him an average monthly income of $940, almost five times the country’s $193 minimum monthly wage.\nCosmetic brands popular in Thailand that use snail mucus include products by Do Day Dream, which uses slime extracted in South Korea in its skin-whitening cream, and Beauty Buffet’s Lansley Magic Snail White Cream.\nOther countries including Chile, Italy and France also breed snails for their mucus.\nThere are about 85 snail farms in Nakhon Nayok province where farmers say they extract the mucus no more than once a month to maintain the animals’ health.\nThe snails even get a break from having their slime extracted for four months each year - to keep them healthy and “happy”.
