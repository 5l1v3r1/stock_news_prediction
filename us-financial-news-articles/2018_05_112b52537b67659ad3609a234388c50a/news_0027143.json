(NASDAQ:PTX), a specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nFirst quarter 2018 net revenues were $28.1 million, a 5% decrease from the $29.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 selling, general and administrative expense decreased by 15% to $17.3 million, as compared to the prior year period. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $18.6 million, as compared to $29.5 million for the prior year period. First quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA improved to $2.5 million, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $(0.3) million in the prior year period.\nBusiness Update\nA special purpose corporation to be jointly owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pernix and an investor group entered into a “stalking horse” asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets of Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., including worldwide rights to Contrave® (naltrexone HCl / bupropion HCl), a prescription-only weight loss medication, for $75 million in cash. Since its launch in 2014, Contrave has become the most prescribed branded weight loss pill in the United States. Known as Mysimba™ in certain markets outside the U.S., it is also marketed in 25 additional countries where it is distributed by a network of partners. An auction for Contrave’s assets is currently scheduled for June 26, 2018. The sale is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, completion of the transaction remains subject to higher or better offers at such auction, and customary closing conditions. Resumed distribution of the 20 mg. dosage strength of Zohydro® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate) with BeadTek® on March 28, 2018. Zohydro ER TRx decreased 3% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2018; growth rate was impacted by the 20 mg backorder that extended through late March 2018. However, sales volume, which represents our sales to customers, was favorably impacted by the relaunch of the 20 mg strength of Zohdyro ER during the last week of the quarter. Silenor® (doxepin) TRx increased 4% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2018. Treximet® (sumatriptan/naproxen sodium) brand TRx decreased 38% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2018; results were impacted by the launch of two generic versions, including Pernix’s own authorized generic. Pernix amended its $40 million asset-based revolving credit facility (ABL Facility) to modify the borrowing base formula which determines Pernix’s capacity to draw on the ABL Facility, which could increase such capacity.\n“We are extremely excited about our participation in the ‘stalking horse’ agreement to acquire the worldwide rights to Contrave and its potential impact on our business,” said John Sedor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pernix Therapeutics. “Importantly, this proposed transaction is reflective of a core element of our growth strategy – to acquire new, compelling assets that leverage our existing infrastructure.”\n“In regard to our existing business, we are pleased with the growth in net revenues for both Zohydro ER and Silenor during the first quarter of 2018,” continued Mr. Sedor. “We remain focused on executing our growth strategy and creating long-term shareholder value. We are excited about the prospects for Contrave should we prevail at the auction and the favorable trends in our existing business.”\nFinancial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 vs. March 31, 2017\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net revenues were $28.1 million, a 5% decrease from the $29.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. A summary of net revenues is outlined below:\nThree Months Ended Amounts in ($000's) March 31, 2018 2017 Increase\n(Decrease) Percent Net Revenues: Treximet $ 12,293 $ 13,770 $ (1,477 ) -11 % Treximet AG 1,847 - 1,847 * Zohydro ER 7,025 5,196 1,829 35 % Silenor 5,348 3,549 1,799 51 % Other products 1,517 7,163 (5,646 ) -79 % Net product revenues 28,030 29,678 (1,648 ) -6 % Co-promotion and other revenue 109 64 45 70 % Total net revenues $ 28,139 $ 29,742 $ (1,603 ) -5 % * Not Meaningful Treximet brand net revenues decreased by $1.5 million, or 11%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to the loss of exclusivity of Treximet® in February 2018, as we experienced generic competition. We expect that future Treximet brand revenues will continue to decrease due to the loss of exclusivity. On February 15, 2018, we launched an authorized generic version of Treximet® (Treximet AG).\nTreximet AG net revenues were $1.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, due to its launch on February 15, 2018. There were no sales of Treximet AG prior to its launch.\nZohydro ER net revenues increased by $1.8 million, or 35%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to an increase in net price of $418,000 and sales volume of $1.4 million. Sales volume was favorably impacted by the relaunch of the 20 mg strength of Zohdyro ER during the last week of the quarter.\nSilenor net revenues increased by $1.8 million, or 51%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to an increase in net price of $800,000 and sales volume of $1.0 million.\nOther net product revenues decreased by $5.6 million, or 79%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was due primarily to the discontinuation of products no longer sold of $4.2 million, including isometheptene mucate, dichlorphenazone and acetaminophen (IDA), and increased competitive and pricing pressures on our generics portfolio.\nCost of product sales decreased by $1.1 million, or 11%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in cost of product sales was due primarily to a $1.3 million decrease in our generics portfolio (primarily IDA), partially offset by increased Zohydro ER product costs of $0.3 million due to increased volume.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $3.0 million, or 15%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower sales force-related expenses of $2.3 million due to the restructuring announced in January 2018, lower marketing expenditures of $1.1 million related primarily to Treximet due to the loss of exclusivity, partially offset by higher legal fees of $0.4 million.\nResearch and development expense decreased by $524,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, due primarily to the discontinuation of certain Zohydro-related research projects.\nNet loss was $18.6 million, or $1.57 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $29.5 million, or $2.94 per basic and diluted share, in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA improved to $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $(0.3) million for three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $2.8 million.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $26.9 million and borrowing availability of $9.0 million under the ABL Facility.\nConference Call\nDate: Thursday, May 10, 2018 Time: 4:30 PM EDT Toll free (U.S.): 888-394-8218 International: 323-701-0225 Conference ID: 7026871 Webcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129150 About Pernix Therapeutics\nPernix Therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of prescription drugs, primarily for the U.S. market.

This non-GAAP financial measure excludes from net loss; net interest; depreciation and amortization; taxes; net revenue adjustments; cost of product sales adjustments; selling, general and administrative adjustments; change in fair value of contingent consideration; non-recurring litigation expenses; change in fair value of derivative liability; restructuring costs; and foreign currency transactions. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that we may exclude for the purposes of our use of adjusted EBITDA; likewise, we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for the purpose of adjusted EBITDA. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because it excludes or adjusts amounts that management and the board of directors do not consider part of core operating results or that are non-recurring when assessing the performance of the organization. We believe that inclusion of adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results and provides consistency in calculations by outside analysts reviewing our results. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and potential future results, but there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Adjustment items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss, cash flow from operations or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to GAAP financial measures and by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to its most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most comparable GAAP financial measure that is included below in this Press Release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
