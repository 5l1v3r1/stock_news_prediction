It also gave a disappointing forecast for yearly revenue and profit.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said the weak forecast was benign compared with the news of the investigation.\n\"While we've seen companies put matters of outstanding, transactions, litigation or investigation off-limits for Q&A, we've never seen a company cut off any Q&A on any topic from analysts or investors,\" Weiss said.\nThe share move, if duplicated after the bell, would knock $5 billion off Symantec's market value compared to the close of trading on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Sai Sachin Ravikumar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:06:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
