I have many great memories there, but I know I need to continue working hard to put myself in the best position when I step out on the court,” Raonic posted on Twitter.\n“Thank you all for your support and see you soon on the grass,” the 27-year-old added.\nRaonic, a French Open quarter-finalist in 2014, missed the back end of last season with the knee injury and made a first round exit at the Australian Open on his return in January.\nHe pulled out in the round of 16 at the Monte Carlo Masters in April after a recurrence of the problem, which has hampered his efforts to replicate the form that saw him finish runner-up at Wimbledon in 2016.\nThe French Open begins on May 27.
