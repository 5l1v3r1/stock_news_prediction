The firm expects to gets its asset management license in China within a few months.\nSavills also plans to raise a pan-Asia fund this year, aiming for at least $1 billion in AUM and high single-digit returns. It will focus on the developed market and offices.\nSavills currently has $2 billion in AUM in Asia, with Japan accounting for more than half. It hopes to double this to $5 billion in the next few years, helped by growth in China.\n“There’s enormous opportunity to work with RMB capital to invest in China ... It’s going to be very difficult to find opportunities necessary to match the return profile of China investors, so we’ll be looking very much to the third and fourth-tier cities,” O’Connor said. REVAMP AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS\nSavills, which has 16.6 billion euro ($19.38 billion) AUM globally, will focus on revamping out-dated malls in smaller Chinese cities to recapture traffic at a time when malls are facing increasing headwinds from e-commerce.\nIt is also looking to work with local asset management firms to meet demand for equity investment products, O’Connor said.\nMany domestic asset management firms invest in real estate financing, where the investor acts as a lender to the property development. In equity investments, the investor holds a stake in a specific property and share profit from income.\n“A lot of domestic asset management companies don’t have the experience (in equity) ... that allows for far more opportunities for us to JV with asset management companies on the distribution side,” O’Connor said.
