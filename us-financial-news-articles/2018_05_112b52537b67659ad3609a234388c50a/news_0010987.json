He has been investing since the age of 14 and has followed Tesla for a decade ( bit.ly/2rh99Zs )\n“I managed over $500,000 for private clients coming out of college and prior to that I was part of this startup that managed money and I invested all in Tesla at $29 per share,” he said.\nWhile analysts were upset with Musk’s treatment of Wall Street, several praised Russell’s questions.\n“It was actually pretty refreshing to have someone come in and be able to ask more strategic questions,” Ark Invest’s Tasha Keeney said. Ark owns 360,000 Tesla shares in their funds.\nOne of the analysts Musk cut short, RBC Capital’s Joseph Spak, also had good things to say about Russell.\nThe blogger to be fair had some good, but very big picture questions, he said.
