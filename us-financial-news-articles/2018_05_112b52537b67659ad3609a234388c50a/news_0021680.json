(NASDAQ:BIOS) (\"BioScrip\" or the \"Company\"), the largest independent national provider of infusion and home care management solutions, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet revenue of $168.6 million, including core product mix of 75.4%, compared to 71.9% in the prior year quarter, including the impact of the implementation of ASC 606 * in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in the recognition of amounts previously reported as bad debt expense as a reduction to revenue\nNet revenues, primarily for antibiotics therapies that carry higher than average gross profit margins, were negatively impacted by an estimated $2.5 million during the first quarter of 2018, due to temporary closures of the Company’s branches resulting from inclement winter weather\nCost of revenue for the quarter included additional product acquisition and delivery costs of approximately $1.0 million related to temporary product shortages\nNet loss from continuing operations of $13.0 million, a $6.4 million improvement compared to the prior year quarter\nAdjusted EBITDA of $5.6 million, 16% above the prior year quarter, driven by a 530 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a $3.6 million reduction in operating expenses, compared to the prior year quarter reflecting ASC 606 pro forma adjustments\nNet cash used in operating activities of $5.2 million, reflecting $8.9 million of operational and working capital improvements over the prior year quarter, and $15.9 million of interest payments, including a bi-annual bond interest payment of $8.8 million\nLiquidity of $40.4 million at March 31, 2018, consisting of $30.4 million of cash and equivalents and $10.0 million of senior credit facility availability, compared to $16.0 million at March 31, 2017\n“BioScrip’s first quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 16% year over year, as we continued to execute successfully on our turnaround strategy. Our teammates navigated significant weather-related branch closures and temporary product shortages, which resulted in lower revenue and increased cost of revenue during the quarter,” said Daniel E. Greenleaf, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We also made important investments in our field force, managed care team, and other strategic initiatives, as we continue to position our business for growth and further earnings expansion. We look forward to accelerating core revenue and gross profit margin expansion as we proceed into the seasonally stronger second half of the year. We remain as enthusiastic as ever about BioScrip’s unique position as the only independent national home infusion pure play, and are reaffirming our 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $54 million and $58 million, and updating our 2018 revenue guidance to between $688 million and $698 million, which was only adjusted for the implementation of ASC 606 * .”\n* Implementation of ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018 resulted in the recognition of amounts previously recorded as bad debt expense as a reduction to revenue. The impact of the change in accounting principle reduced both revenue and bad debt expense by $5.5 million during the quarter. The implementation of ASC 606 did not impact operating income or Adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of 2018, and will not impact operating income or Adjusted EBITDA on a go-forward basis. The implementation of ASC 606 also resulted in a reduction of our 2018 revenue guidance by approximately $22 million, but did not impact 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance.\nConference Call and Presentation\nBioScrip will host a conference call and live webcast on May 10, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results.

You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"outlook,\" \"aim,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"continue\" or comparable terms. Because such statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement include but are not limited to risks associated with: the Company’s ability to make principal and interest payments on our debt and unsecured notes and satisfy the other covenants contained in its debt agreements; the Company’s ability to grow its core Infusion revenues; the Company's ability to continue to execute its financial improvement plan to reduce operating costs and focus its business on its Infusion Services segment; the Company’s ability to evaluate opportunities for improvement and implement solutions as part of its strategic review process; the success of the Company’s initiatives to mitigate the impact of the Cures Act on its business; reductions in federal, state and commercial reimbursement for the Company's products and services; increased government regulation related to the health care and insurance industries; as well as the risks described in the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any duty to update these forward-looking statements after the date hereof, even though the Company's situation may change in the future. All of the forward-looking statements herein are qualified by these cautionary statements.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company is also reporting Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute or alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as a substitute or alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of the Company’s liquidity. In addition, the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Company, represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring, integration and other expenses. As part of restructuring, the Company may incur significant charges such as the write down of certain long−lived assets, temporary redundant expenses, retraining expenses, potential cash bonus payments and potential accelerated payments or terminated costs for certain of its contractual obligations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information regarding the performance of BioScrip’s business operations and facilitates comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results. For a full reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the attachment to this earnings release.\nSchedule 1 BIOSCRIP, INC.
