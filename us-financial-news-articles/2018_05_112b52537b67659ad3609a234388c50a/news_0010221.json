She said it was vital to ensure the legislation is able to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interests of everybody in the United Kingdom.”\nOn Monday, the House of Lords voted to give parliament powers to block or delay a final deal on departure from the European Union, defeating the government. May can try to overturn the changes, which have to be agreed by both houses of parliament before they become law.
