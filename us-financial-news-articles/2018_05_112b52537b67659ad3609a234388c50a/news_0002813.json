The company reported a net loss of $14.2 million, or $1.07 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $23.2 million, or $1.77 per diluted share for the year ago period.\nWalter R. (\"Rick\") Wheeler, President and CEO of Geospace Technologies said, “We are encouraged to see that revenue generated in the second fiscal quarter increased sequentially over the first quarter by 31%, or $4.6 million. While the sequential increase is positive, the amounts recorded in both the three month and six month periods ended March 31, 2018 reflect slight reductions in revenue of 6% and 5%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. These reductions, while not attributed to any particular trend, resulted from the inconsistent demand for the purchase and rental of our seismic products. Despite the slightly lower revenue reported during the fiscal 2018 periods, we successfully generated a gross profit; our first gross profit in three years. The gross profit generated was primarily driven by lower inventory obsolescence charges as well as other financial management and cost reduction efforts that were implemented during this time. Further evidence of our cost control efforts is exemplified by our lower operating expenses. Excluding bad debt reserves and recoveries, operating expenses for the three month and six month periods ended March 31, 2018 fell by 15% and 8%, respectively, compared to last year.”\nTraditional Seismic Products\n“Revenue generated during the second quarter from our traditional seismic products totaled $3.2 million. This represents a decrease of 12% from last year’s second quarter, and generally reflects lower seismic industry demand for sensor products, as well as our connector and marine products. In contrast, revenue from these products in the first six months of the fiscal year increased by 12% over the same period last year, producing revenue of $7.0 million. Sales of specialty sensors and geophones from our rental fleet during the first quarter were the main driver of the increased revenue. Fluctuations in the sale of our traditional seismic products are typical from one period to another. If seismic exploration activities increase with the recent rise in crude oil prices, we would anticipate that these products will see an overall increase in demand.”\nWireless Seismic Products\n“Revenue from our wireless seismic products for the three months and six months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $6.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively. These figures represent respective declines of 37% and 39% from the corresponding periods last year. It is important to note that the revenue generated during both prior year periods was associated with large OBX rental contracts underway at that time, compared with smaller OBX rental contracts in the current year periods. Despite this decline, we believe demand for our OBX marine nodes will continue to increase in future periods, based on the number and size of job tenders our customers are currently quoting. In that light, we recently entered into a contract with a new customer to rent 9,000 OBX nodes for a period of 180-days. We expect revenue from this rental contract to begin near the latter portion of our fiscal third quarter ending on June 30, 2018.”\nReservoir Seismic Products\n“Our reservoir seismic products generated $2.1 million in the second fiscal quarter. This is almost three times the amount recorded in last year’s second fiscal quarter. Similarly, in the first six months of the current fiscal year, revenue from this segment more than doubled from the same period last year. The revenue increase in both periods is attributed to the sale of borehole seismic tools from our rental fleet, which are utilized in ‘frac monitoring’ and near-borehole well and reservoir characterization. Revenue in this segment will continue to fluctuate and will not increase in a significant way unless and until we have been awarded a contract to deliver a permanent reservoir monitoring system. Discussions to provide such systems are underway with customers, but the decision cycles for these projects are typically long and are not expected to have a commercial impact in the near future.”\nNon-Seismic Products\n“Collectively, our non-seismic products performed very well in the three month and six month periods ended March 31, 2018. Total revenue from this business segment reached $7.8 million and $14.3 million over the stated time periods, reflecting respective increases of 21% and 17%. This quarter’s revenue is the largest amount received from these products in the last five fiscal quarters. While our imaging product revenue remained relatively flat compared to last year’s three and six month periods, our industrial products experienced significant gains, improving by 43% and 31%, respectively. For the most part, these gains were the result of greater demand for our water meter cables and connectors and contract manufacturing services. We believe our continued efforts to expand our presence and product offerings in these markets will continue to show benefit. In further efforts to leverage our core technologies within non-seismic markets, we are in early stages of new product development that could significantly expand our presence in the border and perimeter security market. We have long served this industry as a provider of reliable sensor products, but through the adaptation of our advanced permanent reservoir monitoring systems, borehole tools, and cellular based wireless data recorders, we expect to provide products which are both innovative and scalable into the growing security industry. In today’s world of heightened security and risk management, we believe these products have great commercial opportunity.”\n“During the first six months of our 2018 fiscal year we have seen oil prices increase to their highest level in more than three years, albeit considerably less than the record highs experienced in 2014. Although crude storage figures have fluctuated, efforts by OPEC and other aligned nations to reduce oversupply through managed production are having a stabilizing effect. Many oil companies are now achieving positive cash flows, largely through tightly constrained spending in conjunction with higher oil prices. Nevertheless there remains a hesitancy to increase spending, given the history of how costs spiraled upwards in the past. Exploration for new fields has taken the brunt of this spending resistance, but we are encouraged by an apparent loosening in the stranglehold on exploration funding. This is important in light of increasing analyses warning of future supply shortages if the prior trend were to otherwise continue. Our balance sheet remains strong with no debt and almost $41 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. In addition, our available credit facility places our total liquidity at more than $68 million. As the seismic market takes on recovery, we believe our support and dedication to customers’ needs for new and existing technological products favor us. In full complement, our financial strength demonstrates a level of stability to customers that significantly de-risks their choice in using our technology. Together with expanding our technology footprint in our non-seismic business segment, we believe we are very well positioned for the future.”\nConference Call Information\nGeospace Technologies will host a conference call to review its fiscal year 2018 second quarter and six month financial results on May 4, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9 a.m. Central).
