They said they would extend their protest into a third day on Wednesday after considering insufficient a government proposal to reduce only the CIDE fuel tax.\nABCAM, he trucking group organizing the protests, said on Tuesday demonstrations would continue, complaining that the CIDE accounted for only a fraction of the taxes on diesel fuel.\nAccording to state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, state and federal taxes make up 29 percent of the final price of diesel paid by the consumer.
