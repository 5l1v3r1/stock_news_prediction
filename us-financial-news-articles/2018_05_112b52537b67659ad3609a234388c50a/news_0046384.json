Joe Manchin in November, it enables him to extend his feud with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who opposed his candidacy in the GOP primary.\nMr. Blankenship’s third-party hopes are complicated by West Virginia’s “sore loser” law preventing failed candidates from a recognized political party from refiling to run under another party’s banner. Mr. Blankenship said he was prepared to fight that law in court. A representative of the West Virginia Constitution Party, which says on its website it affirms “the Christian character and heritage of our State” and the Bible as the foundation of the law, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n“Now that we know that the establishment will lie and resort to anything else necessary to defeat me, we are better prepared than before,” Mr. Blankenship said Monday.\nPresident Donald Trump also spoke out against Mr. Blankenship’s bid for the GOP nomination.\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey won the Republican Senate primary and will face Sen. Manchin in November. Mr. Manchin is counted among the Senate Democrats’ most vulnerable incumbents, given Mr. Trump’s wide margin of victory in the state in 2016.\nA super PAC aligned with Mr. McConnell provided $1.4 million to another super PAC that spent all of its money on TV ads attacking Mr. Blankenship as too toxic for the Senate, according to a Federal Election Commission report filed Sunday.\nThe group, Mountain Families PAC, raised no money from any other source and had not disclosed its funding ahead of the primary, the filings show.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund is stocked with ex-McConnell aides. It spent $1.8 million in April, the new report shows, the majority of it in West Virginia.\nFor his part, Mr. Blankenship attacked Mr. McConnell in his own advertising, calling him “Cocaine Mitch,” a reference to an allegation that drugs were found during an inspection in Colombian waters on a ship owned by his father-in-law’s company. Neither Mr. McConnell’s office nor the company have commented on the allegation.\nThe bad-blood continued after the primary, with Mr. McConnell’s campaign team tweeting an image of himself amid a swirl of cocaine and the phrase “Thanks for playing, Don.” In that, Mr. McConnell appeared in doctored promotional materials from the Netflix show “Narcos,” about cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar.\nMr. McConnell’s postelection taunt appeared to enrage Mr. Blankenship, who wrote on his own campaign Facebook page, that the ploy was “just more proof that he is not an America person. Thousands die from cocaine use year after year, and he thinks it’s funny that his family’s shipping business hauls cocaine on the high seas. It is not funny. It is sickening.”\n—Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\nWrite to Julie Bykowicz at julie.bykowicz@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T21:19:01.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
