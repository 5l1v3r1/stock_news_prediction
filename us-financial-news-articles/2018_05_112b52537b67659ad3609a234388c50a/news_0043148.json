( reut.rs/2rUKVEW )\nIpreo supports participants including banks, public and private companies raise capital. The deal, which will be funded through debt financing from HSBC, is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals.\nThomson Reuters Corp ( TRI.TO ), the parent company of Reuters News, competes with Ipreo and IHS Markit in some segments of the financial data business.\nBarclays and HSBC are the financial advisors for IHS Markit.
