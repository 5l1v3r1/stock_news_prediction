The cost to develop the project is estimated at 30 million euros ($35.12 million).\nBosnia generates 60 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants and the remainder from hydro-power and aims to diversify its energy sources.\nSeveral developers are seeking to add around 500 MW in wind capacity in Bosnia over the coming years but only four have been issued permits.\nReporting by Maja Zuvela, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:54:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
