Investigators found no evidence of ties to the group and did not charge him with terrorism-related crimes.\nArcher received the maximum possible sentence on Friday in Philadelphia’s Court of Common Pleas, which the city’s district attorney’s office had said was necessary because there were no mitigating circumstances and because of the impact on Hartnett’s health and career.\nHartnett had multiple surgeries on his arm to fix a severed major artery and a shattered elbow, prosecutors said, but had permanent damage and is unlikely to be able to return to policing.\nDespite the bullet wounds, Hartnett was able to get out of his car and chase Archer, shooting him once in the buttocks. Two other nearby officers were then able to arrest Archer.\nReporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:11:57.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
