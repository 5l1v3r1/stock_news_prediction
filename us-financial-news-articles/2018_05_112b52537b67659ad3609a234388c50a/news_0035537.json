But local television channels showed police working at Sporting’s Alvalade stadium, and sports media said that police suspected some Sporting officials of game-fixing mostly in handball matches but also in some football events, by allegedly bribing referees and players.\nOne of those detained was Andre Geraldes, the team manager for Sporting and right-hand man of Sporting President Bruno de Carvalho. He has previously dismissed allegations that Sporting may have bribed referees and players. A handball referee was also questioned by police in Porto.\nOn Tuesday, Sporting condemned “acts of vandalism and aggression” after forward Bas Dost was injured when a group of hooded supporters, armed with sticks and belts, attacked players and staff at the club’s training complex.\nThe club had a tumultuous season, including a spat between de Carvalho and the players over their performance in a Europa League match that culminated in his threat to suspend nearly the entire first-team squad last month.\nPolice have arrested 21 people after Tuesday’s attack.\nPortuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the escalation of violence and corruption around sports risked destroying football in the country.\n“Faced with the gravity of what happened we have to understand that this climate that has been created over some time... cannot and should not continue, because this escalation will destroy Portuguese football, marring it on the international arena and here inside. It’s time to stop the escalation.”\nIn January, prosecutors named the head of football club Benfica, Luis Filipe Vieira, and Vice President Fernando Tavares as suspects in an investigation into a corruption scheme, although Benfica said the probe had nothing to do with the club itself. Benfica is Portugal’s most popular club by membership.
