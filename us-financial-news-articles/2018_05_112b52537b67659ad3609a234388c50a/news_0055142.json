We believe prices could drop more,” he said.\nIn late January, the price of salmon stood at around 50 crowns per kilo, on fears of strong supply growth, but a cold Norwegian winter instead resulted in slower growth in fish stocks, giving a new price spike.\nOn top of this several bank holidays in Norway in May have cut the volume of harvested salmon and helped push prices to near record highs.\nNorway is the world’s top salmon exporter, with fish farming the Nordic country’s second-largest export industry after oil and gas production. The share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish.\nAverage production costs for whole fish, including the cost of harvesting, rose by 13 percent to 34.29 crowns per kilo in 2016, according to data from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries.\nLeading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon.\nBy 1225 GMT, shares of Marine Harvest traded 1.2 percent lower for the day, reversing an earlier rise of about one percent. Similarly, Grieg Seafood, Salmar, Norway Royal Salmon and Leroey all traded down from 0.9 to 1.7 percent.
