Its leader and that of its rival, the Lebanese Democratic Party, issued a joint statement condemning the violence.\nVideo clips which Reuters could not immediately verify showed security forces deployed in the town of Choueifat, south of Beirut, to break up scuffles between the sides.\nLebanon’s election on Sunday was the first for its parliament in nine years. Foreign observers said voting was generally peaceful but that some scuffles and other violence had taken place.\nThe country’s sectarian political system means rival parties from the same sect are often pitted against each other in competition for the same seats.\nThe Druze sect is allocated eight of the 128 seats in parliament, which are divided evenly between Christian and Muslim sects.
