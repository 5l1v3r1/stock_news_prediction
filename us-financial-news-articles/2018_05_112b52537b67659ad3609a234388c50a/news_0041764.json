ARC Group implemented this guidance using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, the cumulative effect of initially adopting the guidance was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at January 1, 2018. Therefore, the comparative period has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the previous revenue recognition guidance. The adoption.\n\"Our Q1 2018 results show continued strength in our business,\" stated Richard W. Akam, Chief Executive Officer of ARC Group. \"We expect to open additional Dick's Wings restaurants during the remainder of 2018, an are currently evaluating potential acquisitions of multiple leading restaurants brands. In anticipation of this, we are fortifying our management team and employee base with key hires and will be reorganizing our business to better position us for our upcoming growth. We are committed to achieving our long-term goal of transforming ARC Group into a holding company comprised of a diversified portfolio of leading brands and profitable businesses that are all strong contributors to our bottom line.\"\n\"As a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, we recognized deferred franchise fees in the amount of $196,478 on our balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 and an increase in our accumulated deficit by the same amount on that date,\" stated Seenu G. Kasturi, Chief Financial Officer of ARC Group. \"The adoption of ASU 2014-09 had the effect of increasing franchise and other revenue from related and unrelated parties by $8,625 for franchise fees and $53,232 for ad fund fees. The effect of the ad fund fees on our revenue was negated by the recognition of $53,232 for ad fund expenses. Accordingly, the net effect of ASU 2014-09 on our Q1 2018 operating results was to increase our revenue, income from operations and net income by $8,625.\"\nDick's Wings restaurants are family fun fooderys ® where both families and sports fans can go to enjoy a unique restaurant experience from first bite to last call ® .
