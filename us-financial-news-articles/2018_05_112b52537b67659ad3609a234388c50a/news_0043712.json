Lava erupts on the outskirts of Pahoa during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., May 19, 2018. REUTERS/Terray Sylvester\nMolten rock from two huge cracks formed a single channel and traveled 1,000 feet in under an hour, twice the speed of previous flows of older lava that have torn through homes, roads and tropical forest for over two weeks, the County of Hawaii’s Civil Defense Agency said.\nThe new lava, which is flowing east underground from the sinking lava lake at Kilauea’s summit, is expected to create more voluminous flows that travel further, threatening homes and a coastal road that is a key exit route for around 2,000 residents.\n“There is much more stuff coming out of the ground and its going to produce flows that will move much further away,” said U.S. Geological Survey scientist Wendy Stovall on a conference call with reporters.

REUTERS/Terray Sylvester\nUp at the volcano’s summit, some 25 miles (40 km) to the east, the second large explosive eruption occurred around midnight, with winds blowing ash onto communities southwest of the crater, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported.\nScientists expect Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, to experience a series of explosive eruptions that could spread ash and volcanic smog across the Big Island, the southernmost of the Hawaiian archipelago. That could pose a hazard to jet engines if it blows into aircraft routes around 30,000 feet (9,144 meters).
