REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe deal announced Wednesday reflects Zoetis’ expectation that the diagnostics category will grow at a faster pace than the broader animal health industry.\nAbaxis — which makes blood and urine tests to predict, detect and treat diseases such as heartworm, Lyme disease or tick-borne infections — will also help its New Jersey-based acquirer bolster its presence in overseas markets.\nZoetis faces much lesser competition internationally than in the United States, its Chief Executive Officer Juan Alaix said on a conference call with analysts.\n“The characteristic of patients in animal health is that they don’t speak. So in our industry, almost every animal getting into clinics needs to have a diagnostic test,” Alaix said.\nThe veterinary diagnostics market worldwide is expected grow to $3.6 billion in 2022 from $2.3 billion in 2017, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets here\nBy contrast, the global animal medicines and vaccines market is worth around $30 billion, according to veterinary consultancy Vetnosis.\nMuch of Zoetis’ revenue is driven by its animal dermatology business, and diagnostics contribute just under 1 percent of its overall annual revenue of more than $5 billion.\nOn Wednesday, Zoetis’ shares fell 0.5 percent, while shares of IDEXX Laboratories Inc ( IDXX.O ), Abaxis’ biggest competitor, fell 3.7 percent.\n“We believe this is a good deal for Zoetis although the valuation seems high,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said.\nShares of Abaxis rose as much as 16 percent to an all-time high of $83.24, inching past Zoetis’ all-cash offer price of $83 per share.\nAt seven times Abaxis’ annual revenue, the price Zoetis is paying is already “pretty steep,” said C.L. King and Associates analyst David Westenberg. “If there’s another bidder, I don’t think Zoetis would go any higher,” he said.\nHowever, should there be a rival offer, the companies most likely to make a bid would be Eli Lilly and Co’s ( LLY.N ) animal health unit Elanco or candy and pet food company Mars Inc, Westenberg said.\nOther possible bidders include dental supply firms Henry Schein Inc ( HSIC.O ) and Patterson Companies Inc ( PDCO.O ), which also have animal health divisions, he added.\nZoetis plans to fund the acquisition through cash and new debt. It expects the deal to close before the end of the year and Abaxis to add to its earnings in 2019.
