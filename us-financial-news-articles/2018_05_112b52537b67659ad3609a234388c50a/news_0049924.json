He did not give any details.\n“We’re going to be submitting additional tax cuts sometime prior to November,” Trump said in a speech to the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group.\nTrump signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut in December, the signature legislative achievement of his presidency.\nThe economy has been a bright spot for Republicans as they face voters in November, with unemployment dropping to a near 17-1/2-year low.\nAll members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate are up for re-election.\nDemocrats must wrest 23 seats nationwide from Republicans to take over the 435-member House. In the Senate, Republicans control the chamber 51 to 49.\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the Susan B.
