Following the merger with inVentiv Health in August 2017 (the \"Merger\") and to aid investors and analysts with year-over-year comparability of results for the merged business, included within are certain \"Combined Company\" metrics that represent combined financial information of INC Research and inVentiv Health as if the Merger had taken place on January 1, 2017, with conforming adjustments to the current year presentation. Please refer to the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Combined Company Non-GAAP Measures\" included in this press release and accompanying tables for important disclosures about non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest GAAP measure.\n\"We produced first quarter results that were in line with our expectations despite temporary headwinds during the quarter. Our optimism for the Company’s long-term growth prospects reflects this quarter's performance, as well as our overall pipeline, which is the strongest since the close of the merger of INC Research and inVentiv Health,\" said Alistair Macdonald, Chief Executive Officer of Syneos Health. \"We are delivering on our combined clinical and commercial value proposition, creating new opportunities with existing and potential customers by leveraging our competitive advantage – the industry’s deepest set of comprehensive capabilities. We remain keenly focused on continuing to provide exceptional customer service, achieving our integration milestones and synergies and attracting and retaining top talent. We are well positioned to drive growth for the remainder of the year.\"\nImpact of the adoption of ASC 606\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The prior periods were not revised under this guidance and remain as previously reported. As a result of adopting the standard, the Company is no longer permitted to present service revenue and revenue associated with reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses (reimbursable revenue) separately in the statements of operations. The following schedule includes a comparison of the first quarter of 2018 financial results as reported compared to results presented as if the previous accounting guidance (ASC 605) had been in effect. The adoption of ASC 606 lowered the Company's total revenue and income from operations, and had no impact on its cash flows from operations.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 ASC 606\nAs Reported ASC 605\nAs Adjusted ASC 605\nAs Reported (unaudited, in thousands) Service revenue $ 1,057,196 $ 760,058 $ 252,078 Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses — 310,098 129,840 Total revenue 1,057,196 1,070,156 381,918 Direct costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 532,057 536,888 154,835 Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses 308,766 310,098 129,840 Selling, general, and administrative 99,259 99,716 44,934 Restructuring and other costs 13,707 13,707 1,927 Transaction and integration-related expenses 25,211 25,211 2 Depreciation 18,028 18,028 6,164 Amortization 49,993 49,993 9,464 Total operating expenses 1,047,021 1,053,641 347,166 Income from operations $ 10,175 $ 16,515 $ 34,752 First Quarter 2018 Results\nGAAP service revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.06 billion, an increase of $805.1 million, or 319.4%, compared to $252.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding reimbursable revenue of $308.8 million, the service revenue increase was primarily due to the Merger with inVentiv in August 2017.\nCombined Company adjusted service revenue under ASC 605 decreased by $24.4 million, or 3.1%, to $761.5 million from $785.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to project cancellations and customer downsizing within the Company's selling solutions and communications service offerings in 2017, partially offset by growth in the Company's Clinical Solutions segment and a foreign currency exchange rate benefit of $10.9 million.\nUnder ASC 605, the Combined Company Clinical Solutions segment generated $530.9 million of adjusted service revenue in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of $11.8 million or 2.3%, compared to $519.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to revenue from strong net awards in 2017 and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact, which was partially offset by a less favorable revenue mix due to lower customer contract modifications.\nThe Combined Company Commercial Solutions segment generated $230.6 million of adjusted service revenue under ASC 605 in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $36.1 million, or 13.5%, compared to $266.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily due to project cancellations and customer downsizing within the Company's selling solutions and communications service offerings, along with lower new business awards in 2017 that reduced 2018 revenue. Despite these factors, adjusted service revenue from the Company's Commercial Solutions segment was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP income from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $10.2 million, a decrease of $24.6 million, or 70.7%, compared to $34.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributed to additional expenses associated with the Merger. Combined Company adjusted income from operations under ASC 605 was $114.7 million, or 15.1% of adjusted service revenue, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $125.9 million, or 16.0% of the adjusted service revenue, in the first quarter of 2017.\nCombined Company adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 under ASC 605 declined to $132.7 million, or 17.4% of adjusted service revenue, compared to $146.8 million or 18.7% of adjusted service revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. However, when normalized for the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the first quarter of 2018 and certain nonrecurring benefits in the first quarter of 2017, primarily in the Commercial Solutions segment, adjusted EBITDA and the related margin were relatively flat. The benefits of revenue growth in the Company's Clinical business, realized synergies, and lower selling, general, and administrative expenses, were offset by a decline in the Company’s Commercial Solutions segment, as well as the less favorable revenue mix in both Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions.\nGAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.6 million, or $0.24 diluted loss per share, compared to net income of $21.2 million, or $0.38 diluted earnings per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Combined Company adjusted net income under ASC 605 for the first quarter of 2018 was $60.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to $55.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the Combined Company adjusted net income was primarily due to lower interest and tax expense, partially offset by the decline in Adjusted EBITDA, as outlined above.\nUnder ASC 605, net new business awards for the first quarter of 2018 were $872.1 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15x. Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions net new business awards for the quarter were $549.7 million and $322.4 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04x and 1.40x, respectively. Clinical Solutions Combined Company net new business awards grew by 6.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and maintained a trailing twelve-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.21x. As of March 31, 2018, ending backlog under ASC 605 for Clinical Solutions and the selling solutions offering within Commercial Solutions was $3.81 billion and $466.5 million, respectively.\nCapital Deployment Update\nAs part of the Company's balanced approach to capital deployment, during the first quarter the Company repaid $31.3 million of its term loan debt, bringing its total debt reduction since the closing of the Merger to $83.3 million.\nThe Company also paid $37.5 million to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock during the first quarter under the share repurchase program announced on February 28, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, $212.5 million remains authorized under this plan for discretionary repurchases through the end of 2019.\nFull Year 2018 Business Outlook\nGuidance takes into account a number of factors, including existing backlog, current sales pipeline, trends in cancellations and delays, and estimated Merger synergies, net of reinvestments. Furthermore, the guidance is based on current foreign currency exchange rates, current interest rates taking into account debt repricing, and expected tax rate, but does not take into account the effects of stock repurchases after the first quarter of 2018. Guidance for the full year of 2018 is outlined below and has been prepared under both the new revenue recognition requirements of ASC 606 and the previous revenue recognition requirements of ASC 605:\nASC 605\nGuidance Issued: ASC 606\nGuidance Issued: February 28, 2018 May 9, 2018 May 9, 2018 Low High Low High Low High (in millions, except per share data) Adjusted service revenue $ 3,235.0 $ 3,340.0 $ 3,235.0 $ 3,340.0 $ 4,400.0 $ 4,550.0 Clinical Solutions adjusted service revenue 2,245.0 2,300.0 2,245.0 2,300.0 3,250.0 3,350.0 Commercial Solutions adjusted service revenue 990.0 1,040.0 990.0 1,040.0 1,150.0 1,200.0 Adjusted EBITDA 620.0 660.0 620.0 660.0 580.0 620.0 Adjusted net income 285.5 313.1 295.0 324.0 266.0 295.0 Adjusted diluted EPS $ 2.68 $ 2.94 $ 2.80 $ 3.07 $ 2.52 $ 2.80 The Company anticipates that its 2018 effective tax rate will be between 27.0% and 28.0%, which takes into account the effect of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\").

Actual results might those explicit or implicit in the . Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: risks associated with the integration of the Company's business with the business of inVentiv Health and its operation of the combined business following the closing of the Merger; the Company's ability to maintain or generate new business awards; the Company's ability to increase its market share, grow its business, and execute its growth strategies; the Company's backlog not being indicative of future revenues and its ability to realize the anticipated future revenue reflected in its backlog; the impact of adoption of the new accounting standard of recognizing revenue from customers; the impact of the Tax Act; the Company's ability to adequately price its contracts and not overrun cost estimates; general and international economic, political, and other risks, including currency and stock market fluctuations and the uncertain economic environment; fluctuations in the Company's financial results; reliance on key personnel; customer or therapeutic area concentration; and the other risk factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and other SEC filings, copies of which are available free of charge on the Company's website at investor.syneoshealth.com . Syneos Health assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these , except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), this press release contains certain Combined Company and Combined Segment non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted service revenue, adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income (including adjusted diluted earnings per share), EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA, as well as current year metrics as if ASC 605 had been in effect. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of operations, balance sheets, or statements of cash flows of the Company. To aid investors and analysts with year-over-year comparability for the merged business, the Company has included financial information that combines certain stand-alone INC Research and inVentiv Health financial information as if the Merger had taken place on January 1, 2017, with conforming adjustments to the 2017 presentation.\nThe Company defines Combined Company adjusted service revenue as the stand-alone INC Research and inVentiv Health service revenue as if the Merger had taken place on January 1, 2017, with conforming adjustments to the 2017 presentation and adjusted to include revenue eliminated as a result of purchase accounting.\nThe Company defines Combined Company adjusted income from operations as income from operations excluding expenses and transactions that the Company believes are not representative of its core operations, namely: acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments; acquisition-related amortization; restructuring and other costs; transaction and integration-related expenses; share-based compensation expense; discretionary bonus accrual reversals; R&D tax credit adjustments; monitoring and advisory fees; and acquisition-related revaluation adjustments. The Company defines Combined Company adjusted operating margin as adjusted income from operations as a percentage of adjusted service revenue.\nThe Company defines Combined Company adjusted net income (including adjusted diluted earnings per share) as net income (including diluted earnings per share) excluding the items excluded from adjusted income from operations mentioned previously, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other expense (income), net. After giving effect to these items, the Company has also included an adjustment to its income tax rate to reflect the expected long-term income tax rate and estimated impact of the enactment of the Tax Act.\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude certain expenses and transactions that the Company believes are not representative of its core operations, namely: acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments; restructuring and other costs; transaction and integration-related expenses; share-based compensation expense; discretionary bonus accrual reversals; R&D tax credit adjustments; monitoring and advisory fees; acquisition-related revaluation adjustments; other expense, net; and loss on extinguishment of debt. The Company presents EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it believes they are useful metrics for investors as they are commonly used by investors, analysts and debt holders to measure the Company's ability to fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.\nEach of the non-GAAP measures noted above are used by management and the Board to evaluate the Company's core operating results because they exclude certain items whose fluctuations from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the core operations of the business. Adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net income (including adjusted diluted earnings per share) are used by management and the Board to assess the Company's business.\nNon-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, other companies might calculate these measures differently. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures included in this press release and the accompanying tables.\nInvestor Relations Contact: Press/Media Contact: Ronnie Speight Danielle DeForge Vice President, Investor Relations Senior Director, External Communications Phone: +1 919 745 2745 Phone: +1
