It offered no details, however, saying only that “some clients saw a delay in executing transactions” due to Friday’s issue.\nIn January, hackers attempted to rob the government-run export bank Bancomext, but officials said they were unsuccessful.\nReporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T01:36:17.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
