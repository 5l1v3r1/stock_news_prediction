Their net sales totaled $4.92 billion in March, compared with $43.19 billion in net purchases in February.\nOffshore investors unloaded $23.05 billion in Treasuries in March, their steepest monthly sale since December 2016, while foreign central banks added $18.39 billion in U.S. government debt on top of the $19.06 billion they purchased in February, according to the latest Treasury data.\nAPPETITE FOR AGENCIES, CORPORATES Foreigners, while less keen on Treasuries, scooped up agency securities and corporate bonds in March.\nTheir net purchases of agencies totaled $25.28 billion, the most since July 2016, while they bought $22.39 billion in corporate debt, the highest monthly increase since November, Treasury data showed.\nIn contrast, overseas investors sold $24.15 billion in stocks in March, the biggest monthly outflow since September 2015.\nThe S&P 500 index fell 2.7 percent in March, marking its first quarterly loss since the third quarter of 2015 due to worries about a possible trade war, rising interest rates and pricey technology stocks.\nAdditional reporting by Dan Burns; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and James Dalgleish\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
