GAAP capitalization rate is calculated by dividing the income the property will generate (before debt service and depreciation and after fixed costs and variable costs) by the acquisition price of the property.\n2 The weighted average remaining lease term in years based upon square feet as of May 16, 2018.\n3 Implied Investment Grade includes ratings of tenant parent (regardless of whether or not the parent has guaranteed the tenant's obligation under the lease) or lease guarantor. Implied Investment Grade ratings are also determined using a proprietary Moody's analytical tool, which compares the risk metrics of the non-rated company to those of a company with an actual rating. The ratings information is as of March 2, 2018.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-net-lease-closed-on-five-industrial-properties-for-83-0-million-300649928.html\nSOURCE Global Net Lease, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.globalnetlease.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-net-lease-closed-on-five-industrial-properties-for-83-0-million-300649928.html"], "published": "2018-05-17T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:54:57.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
