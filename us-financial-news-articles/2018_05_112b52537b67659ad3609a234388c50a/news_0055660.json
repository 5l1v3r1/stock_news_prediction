The following year, he had six wins and in 2014 was the IndyCar Series champion.\nThe following year, he finished second at the iconic race to team mate Colombia’s Juan Pablo Montoya.\n“I was so disappointed in 2015, so close,” Power said.\n“I thought about that a lot, what I should have done should have changed this and that. It’s just not your day. That day I did everything (I) could.\n“Today I did it again, and it all worked out well.\n“It was through speed, pit stops, in and out laps, good restarts.\n“It was a fight to win it. It was not an easy win. That makes it much more satisfying.” Reporting by Lewis Franck; Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T04:02:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
