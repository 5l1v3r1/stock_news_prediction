The president took that step after Moyane refused to step down.\nDays after Zuma ally Moyane was suspended, ratings agency Moody’s affirmed South Africa’s investment-grade credit rating.\nMoody’s said the changes at the South African Revenue Service and cabinet had set the economy on a positive path.\nOn Friday, the president’s office said Moyane would face the charges over his alleged misconduct in violation of his duties and responsibilities in terms of the revenue service Act.\n“The disciplinary inquiry relates to alleged leadership and organizational failures,” the president’s office said.\nMoyane could not be reached for comment.\nThe agency has been plagued by infighting over the last the three years and is subject to ongoing government investigations.\n($1 = 12.5765 rand)\nReporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Writing by James Macharia; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:14:10.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
