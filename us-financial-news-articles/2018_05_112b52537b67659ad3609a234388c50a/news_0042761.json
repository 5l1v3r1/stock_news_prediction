Being yourself can be bothering” he said.\nIn his native Dutch, he said; “Unfortunately, being REAL is not enough for SOME PEOPLE”, adding that the decision to quit international soccer gave him “much pain in my heart”.\nMartinez, who also sprung a surprise by not naming his final 23-man squad, declined to give details of what he called an “honest” talk with the player, who cemented his popularity among fans at Euro 2016 where Belgium reached the quarter-finals.\nBut his decision was tactical.\n“We know that Radja has a very important role in his club and we cannot give him that role in our squad,” Martinez told a news conference.\nContrary to expectations, Martinez listed 28 players on Monday. These will be whittled down to the final 23 for Russia on June 4, two days after a friendly against fellow World Cup finalists Portugal in Brussels.\nGiving himself an extra couple of weeks until FIFA’s last squad deadline would give the likes of experienced Barcelona defender Thomas Vermaelen time to prove his fitness.\nThird in the world rankings and hungry for the success that has eluded them despite boasting some of Europe’s most gifted players, England’s Group G opponents head to Russia with Premier League stars including Chelsea forward Eden Hazard and midfielder Kevin De Bruyne from champions Manchester City.\nManchester United striker Romelu Lukaku also makes the preliminary squad despite recent injury issues, along with 32-year-old Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany in defence.\nAmong fresher faces given a chance are winger Adnan Januzaj from Real Sociedad and 21-year-old Monaco midfielder Youri Tielemans.\nThe 28-man provisional squad is:\nGoalkeepers: Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea), Simon Mignolet (Liverpool), Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Matz Sels (Newcastle United).\nDefenders: Toby Alderweireld (Tottenham), Christian Kabasele (Watford), Jordan Lukaku (Lazio), Thomas Meunier (Paris Saint-Germain), Thomas Vermaelen (Barcelona), Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham), Laurent Ciman (Los Angeles), Dedryck Boyata (Celtic), Vincent Kompany (Manchester City)\nMidfielders: Marouane Fellaini (Manchester United), Axel Witsel (Tianjin Taida), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Eden Hazard (Chelsea), Nacer Chadli (West Bromwich Albion), Leander Dendoncker (Anderlecht), Thorgan Hazard (Borussia Moenchengladbach), Adnan Januzaj (Real Sociedad), Youri Tielemans (Monaco)\nForwards: Moussa Dembele (Celtic), Michy Batshuayi (Chelsea/Dortmund), Christian Benteke (Crystal Palace), Yannick Carrasco (Atletico Madrid), Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United), Dries Mertens (Napoli) Reporting by Alastair Macdonald, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T16:11:35.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
