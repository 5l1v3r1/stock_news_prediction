If you don’t stay on it and if you don’t do the right things to be financially sustainable, you can fall right back to where you were,” he said.\nHe added that Detroit still faces the task of increasing its revenue base by attracting businesses and residents.\nThe city’s population, which dropped by 25 percent to 713,777 in the decade ending in 2010, fell to 672,795 in 2016, according to the U.S. Census.\nJohn Hill, Detroit’s chief financial officer, said the city is projecting balanced budgets over the next several years as income and property tax collections have increased since the bankruptcy.\nHe added that city has begun to set aside money to cover higher-than-expected pension payments starting in fiscal 2024. Detroit is also taking steps to deal with an increase in bond payments beginning in fiscal 2025 with the hope of being able to one day issue general obligation bonds again to finance capital projects, according to Hill.\nSome investors are cautious as Detroit’s credit ratings remain solidly in the junk level.\n“This is the first step in many that they will have to take to regain the confidence of investors,” said Robert Amodeo, head of municipal investments at Western Asset.\nDetroit’s finances came under state scrutiny in 2011, eventually leading to a declaration of a fiscal emergency and the subsequent appointment of Kevyn Orr, a bankruptcy and restructuring lawyer, as the city’s emergency manager in 2013.\nSteven Rhodes, the now-retired U.S. judge who presided over the bankruptcy, called Monday’s vote “another extraordinary milestone,” while urging city officials to maintain their focus on neighborhoods, schools and pensions.\nDetroit’s bankruptcy, which Orr filed in July 2013, was eclipsed by last year’s Puerto Rico case dealing with the U.S. territory’s $120 billion of debt.
