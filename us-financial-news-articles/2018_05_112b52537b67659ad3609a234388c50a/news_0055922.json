Adjusted EBITDA does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA allows Route1 to compare its operating performance over time on a consistent basis.\nRoute1 used cash in operating activities of approximately $0.2 million during Q1 2018 compared with cash generated from operating activities of $0.4 million in Q1 2017. Non-cash working capital used was $0.4 million in Q1 2018 compared to $1.6 million used in the same period a year earlier. Net cash used in the day–to-day operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.6 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 2017, a decrease of $0.6 million. The decrease in net cash used was a result of an increase in deferred revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the working capital balances acquired with the acquisition of Group Mobile.\nBalance sheet extracts\nIn 000s of CAD dollars Mar 31\n2018 Dec 31\n2017 Sep 30\n2017 Jun 30\n2017 Mar 31\n2017 Cash 600 1,037 1,408 2,080 704 Total current assets 6,292 2,035 2,856 2,924 1,890 Total current liabilities 6,292 1,829 2,534 2,396 1,113 Net working capital - 206 322 528 777 Total assets 8,646 3,171 4,081 4,213 3,114 Bank debt - - - - - Total shareholders’ equity 2,256 1,236 1,432 1,720 1,904 Route1’s cash position historically has been at its highest level during the second quarter of the fiscal year as a direct result of the timing of annual MobiKEY subscription renewal payments. With the closing of the Group Mobile acquisition, this likely will change and the highest level of cash on Route1’s balance sheet will be tied to the timing of payments related to Group Mobile sales.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred and the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date of for Group Mobile .
