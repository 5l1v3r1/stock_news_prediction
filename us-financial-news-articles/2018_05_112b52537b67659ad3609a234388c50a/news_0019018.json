The investigation focuses on gross breaches of fiduciary duty by the Board of Directors of ALGT, as publicized in a 60 Minutes exposé critical of the record of inadequate safety at the Company. According to the 60 Minutes exposé, an alarming rate of unscheduled landings and in-flight emergencies plague ALGT's operations, notwithstanding that it only operates a small fleet of one hundred planes. Furthermore, according to the 60 Minutes exposé, ALGT is statistically approximately \"three and a half times more likely to have serious in-flight mechanical failures than other U.S. airlines.\"\nWeissLaw is investigating whether ALGT's Board breached its fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders by failing to properly oversee ALGT's maintenance of its fleet, devoting too few resources and personnel for the proper maintenance of aircrafts, resulting in significant harm to the Company as a result of repeated failures and disruptions of its flights. If you own ALGT shares and wish to discuss this investigation or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Joshua Rubin of WeissLaw LLP at (888)593-4771 , or by e-mail at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.
