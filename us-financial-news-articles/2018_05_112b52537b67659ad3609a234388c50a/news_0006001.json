The increase in net income was primarily due to the full quarter’s impact of last year's loan growth. In addition, loans increased by $12.1 million, which also contributed to the increased net income in the first quarter. As we discussed in our year-end press release, the impact of the tax benefit is also contributing to the net income growth, reducing tax expense by $49,000 year-over-year.\nAs of the end of the first quarter March 31, 2018, the Bank’s annualized Return on Average Assets (ROAA) was 1.22% and Return on Average Equity (ROAE) was 9.84%, compared to prior year-end where ROAA was 0.72% and ROAE was 5.47% for the twelve-months ending December 31, 2017. The Banks ROAA and ROAE were impacted by the one-time tax adjustment at year end and are benefiting from the implementation of the new tax legislation in 2018.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAssets\nAs of March 31, 2018, total assets were $243.7 million, as compared to $232.9 million at December 31, 2017 – an increase of $10.8 million, or 4.6%.\nDon Haake, President and CEO stated, “As we end the first quarter, I am very pleased to highlight the Banks continued stable growth and profitability, particularly, the sound performance of the loan portfolio. Furthermore, we are encouraged by the significant pre-tax earnings growth of $200,000, or 24.4%, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period the prior year. The growth in earnings can be directly attributed to the Bank’s grassroots approach to our business, complimented by the measurable repeat business and referrals we receive from our existing customers. Loans as of March 31, 2018 totaled $229.6 million, up $12.1 million, or 5.5%, as compared to December 31, 2017. Total deposits also increased $4.7 million, or 2.6%, ending March 31, 2018 at $187.1 million. The Bank also showed an increase in borrowings of $5.2 million, or 25.9%, to help supplement the funding of the loan growth in the first quarter.\"\nCapital\nStockholders’ equity totaled $30.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $29.6 million at December 31, 2017. All of the Bank’s capital ratios remain strong and in excess of the current regulatory definition of a “well capitalized” institution. At March 31, 2018, the Bank’s Tier One Leverage Capital Ratio was 12.71% and the Bank’s total risk based capital ratio was 15.34%. In addition, the Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio was 14.09% as of March 31, 2018, which is in excess of the 6.75% current minimum regulatory threshold and the fully transitioned ratio of 7.0% for the year 2019. In addition, book value reached $9.29 per share, compared to $9.06 per share as of December 31, 2017, and market value of as of the end of the first quarter 2018 was $10.05 per share, with a market to book ratio of approximately 108%.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income as of the end of March 31, 2018 was $2,261,000, compared to $1,937,000 for the same period in 2017 – an increase of $324,000, or 16.7%. The Bank’s net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, remained strong at 3.93%, compared to 3.91% for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income decreased year over year by $22,000 or 24.4%. Last year in the first quarter, the Bank received prepayment penalties that did not recur in 2018. The Bank’s major contribution to earnings comes from the Net Interest Income line item, so while a prepayment penalty gives the Bank the one time earnings boost, the net interest income suffers when there are prepayment penalties.\nNon-Interest Expense\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total non-interest expense increased $1,000, or 0.1%, to $1,169,000 compared to the same period last year.\nAsset Quality\nThe Bank had three non-performing loans totaling $1,347,000 at March 31, 2018, as compared to $104,000 for the same period last year. An additional loan was added to nonaccrual this quarter in the amount of $804,000, which is well collateralized. We are continuing to attempt to work through the loan that was added last quarter with the borrower; however, we will pursue foreclosure, if deemed necessary. Also, it should be noted that one non-performing loan paid-off in February 2018 in the amount of $94,000. We still have one OREO property on the books for $1.25 million, with a value of $1.45 million based on a current appraisal, which is currently under contract of sale and anticipated to close later this year.\nTHE BANK\nEnterprise Bank NJ, headquartered in Kenilworth, New Jersey, is listed on the Pink Sheets under the symbol \"ENBN\".
