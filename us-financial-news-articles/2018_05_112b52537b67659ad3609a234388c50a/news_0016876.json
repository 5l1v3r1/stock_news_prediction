By combining our SLF Asia and International capabilities, we expect to accelerate the development of our high net worth insurance business in Asia. SLF U.S. will focus on growing our U.S. group benefits business and managing the in-force block of U.S. individual insurance.\nOur reported net income of $669 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased $118 million compared to the same quarter in 2017, including unfavourable market related impacts of $79 million. Underlying net income in the first quarter of 2018, increased $197 million to $770 million, primarily driven by interest on par seed capital (1) of $110 million, strong business growth, the lower income tax rate in the U.S., investment experience, and mixed insurance experience.\nOur reported ROE (2) increased to 13.1% reflecting higher earnings. Our dividend is increasing by $0.02, from $0.455 to $0.475. SLF Inc. and its wholly-owned holding companies had $1,654 million in cash and other liquid assets as at March 31, 2018. A dividend of $1.2 billion from Sun Life Assurance to SLF Inc. was declared subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nA Leader in Insurance and Wealth Solutions in our Canadian Home Market\nSLF Canada's reported net income was $249 million in the quarter, down 6% compared to the same period in 2017, largely reflecting unfavourable market impacts primarily driven by declining equity markets. Underlying net income was higher by $66 million from the same period in 2017, mainly due to interest on par seed capital (1) of $75 million, strong business growth in Group Retirement Services (\"GRS\"), as well as positive credit experience, partially offset by less favourable mortality experience and unfavourable morbidity experience.\nFollowing a strong sales quarter as a result of tax legislation and product design changes in the first quarter of 2017, SLF Canada individual insurance sales decreased 39% in the first quarter of 2018. Group Benefits and wealth sales decreased 32% and 13%, respectively, compared to the same quarter in the prior year mainly due to fewer large case sales.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to deepen our digital relationship with our Clients, introducing functionality to make it easier for Clients to interact with us at the right time and in the way they choose. For example, individual in-plan deposits in Group Retirement Services increased 45% over the prior year to $224 million, driven by more relevant and targeted messaging to Clients, including Ella (our interactive digital coach).\n(1)\nInterest on seed capital transferred from the participating account to the shareholder account. For additional information, see section C - Profitability in this document.\n(2)\nRepresents a non-IFRS financial measure. See section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document.\nA Leader in U.S. Group Benefits\nReported net income was $96 million, up $71 million from the same quarter in the prior year, and underlying net income was $129 million, up $70 million from the same quarter in the prior year. SLF U.S.'s underlying net income reflected interest on par seed capital (1) of $35 million, favourable morbidity experience, and investment activity, partially offset by unfavourable policyholder behaviour and unfavourable mortality experience. The after-tax profit margin for Group Benefits (2) was 5.6% as of the first quarter of 2018, compared to 2.8% as of the first quarter of 2017.\nSLF U.S. Group Benefits sales in U.S. dollars increased 17% compared to the same quarter in 2017, with increases across most product lines. Sun Life U.S. grew its stop-loss business-in-force by 20%, compared to the first quarter of 2017, on strong sales and renewal results for January 1, 2018 effective dates driven by continued delivery of its Client value and service.\nThe Company's U.S. Disability RMS business implemented a large, new disability program with an industry partner. SLF U.S. also continued to streamline and enhance the onboarding experience for new Clients, installing more than 1,200 employer groups during the first quarter.\nA Leader in Global Asset Management\nSLF Asset Management's reported net income of $210 million was up 23% from the first quarter of 2017 largely due to MFS Investment Management's (\"MFS\") higher average net assets and the lower income tax rate in the U.S. Underlying net income was $231 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 26% from the first quarter of 2017, driven by higher average net assets and the lower income tax rate in the U.S. The higher average net assets resulted in a pre-tax net operating profit margin ratio for MFS (3) of 38%, up from 36% in the first quarter of 2017.\nSLF Asset Management ended the first quarter with $681.7 billion in assets under management consisting of $621.6 billion (US$482.2 billion) from MFS and $60.1 billion from Sun Life Investment Management (\"SLIM\"). MFS net outflows of US$4.3 billion in the quarter were partially offset by SLIM net inflows of $0.3 billion.\nMFS ranked second out of approximately 50 firms in the Barron's 2017 Fund Family Rankings for ten-year firm-wide performance for the third consecutive year. In the first quarter of 2018, 83%, 84% and 91% of MFS's retail fund assets ranked in the top half of their Lipper categories based on three-, five-, and ten-year performance, respectively.\nA Leader in Asia through Distribution Excellence in Higher Growth Markets\nSLF Asia's reported net income of $133 million was up $48 million from the first quarter of 2017 and underlying net income of $128 million was up $31 million from the first quarter of 2017, reflecting strong business growth.\nSLF Asia insurance sales were $233 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 17% compared to the first quarter of 2017, with double-digit growth in the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, India, and Malaysia. SLF Asia wealth sales were up by 29% to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Strong wealth sales were led by continued growth in our pension business in Hong Kong, our Indian joint venture mutual fund company, and our asset management company in the Philippines.\nIn Hong Kong, our Rainbow MPF (4) plan was ranked highest at the 2018 MPF Awards (5) and won the 2018 MPF Scheme of the Year. In addition, we were also awarded nine 2018 Consistent Performer awards in the one-, five-, and ten-year categories.\n(1)\nInterest on seed capital transferred from the participating account to the shareholder account.

Prior periods have been conformed to this presentation.\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nOur reported net income of $669 million in the first quarter of 2018, increased $118 million compared to the same quarter in 2017, including $79 million unfavourable change in market related impacts. Underlying net income in the first quarter of 2018, increased $197 million to $770 million, primarily driven by interest on par seed capital of $110 million, as described in Experience related items in this section, strong business growth, the lower income tax rate in the U.S., as well as identified experience related items.\n1. Market related impacts (1)\nMarket related impacts in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year, was primarily driven by unfavourable impacts from equity markets and fair values of real estate.\n2. Assumption changes and management actions (1)\nThe effects of assumption changes and management actions (\"ACMA\") were not significant during the first quarter of 2018 or the first quarter of 2017.\n3. Other adjustments (1)\nOther adjustments decreased reported net income by $30 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a decrease of $34 million in the first quarter of 2017. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, Certain hedges in Canada that do not qualify for hedge accounting, and acquisition, integration and restructuring amounts were favourable, partially offset by Fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards.\n(1)\nSee section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document for a breakdown of the components.\n4. Experience related items\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the seed capital that was transferred to the participating account at demutualization was transferred back to the shareholder account, along with accrued investment income. The results include the investment income of $110 million - $75 million in SLF Canada and $35 million in SLF U.S. (\"interest on par seed capital\") - which is presented in Experience related items - Other. Additional information can be found in Note 10 of the first quarter 2018 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCompared to the prior year, Experience related items also reflected the favourable impact of investment activity in SLF U.S. and U.K., morbidity experience predominantly in SLF U.S., and credit experience primarily in SLF Canada, partially offset by unfavourable mortality experience, more unfavourable lapse and other policyholder behaviour, and other expense items across the enterprise.\n5. Income taxes\nOur statutory tax rate is normally reduced by various tax benefits, such as lower taxes on income subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions, a range of tax exempt investment income, and other sustainable tax benefits that are expected to decrease our effective tax rate.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, our effective income tax rates on reported net income and underlying net income (1) were 16.4% and 15.8% compared to 19.6% and 17.5% in the first quarter of 2017, respectively. This is within our expected range of 15% to 20%.\n6. Impact of foreign exchange rates\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, our reported net income and underlying net income both decreased by $19 million, as a result of the impact of the movement of the Canadian dollar in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the average exchange rates in the first quarter of 2017.\n(1)\nOur effective income tax rate on underlying net income is calculated using underlying net income and income tax expense associated with underlying net income, which excludes amounts attributable to participating policyholders.\nD.

The increase in AUM of $4.1 billion between December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 resulted primarily from:\n(i)\nan increase of $19.2 billion from the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to exchange rates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017; and\n(ii)\nan increase of $0.5 billion of other business activities; partially offset by\n(iii)\na decrease of $11.6 billion from unfavourable market movements; and\n(iv)\nnet outflow of mutual, managed, and segregated funds of $4.0 billion.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net outflows of mutual, managed and segregated funds were $4.0 billion, predominantly driven by net outflows from MFS of $5.4 billion, partially offset by net inflows of $0.9 billion from SLF Canada, $0.4 billion from SLF Asia and $0.3 billion from SLIM.\nE.

See section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document.\n(3)\nInnovative capital instruments consist of Sun Life ExchangEable Capital Securities, and qualify as regulatory capital. However, under IFRS they are reported as Senior debentures in our Annual and Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information see section I - Capital and Liquidity Management - 1 - Capital in our 2017 annual MD&A.\nEffective January 1, 2018, The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (\"OSFI\") has replaced the Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirements (\"MCCSR\") capital adequacy guideline with the Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (\"LICAT\"). As indicated by OSFI, the LICAT is an evolution of OSFI's regulatory capital expectations, as it represents a more advanced and risk-sensitive approach to capital.\nSLF Inc. is a non-operating insurance company and is subject to the LICAT guideline. As at March 31, 2018, SLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio was 149% which is well above OSFI's regulatory minimum ratio of 90%.\nOur total capital consists of subordinated debt and other capital instruments, participating policyholders' equity, and total shareholders' equity which includes common shareholders' equity and preferred shareholders' equity. As at March 31, 2018, our total capital was $27.0 billion, compared to $27.1 billion as at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total capital was primarily the result of the repayment of $400 million of subordinated debentures detailed below, payment of $277 million of dividends on common shares, unrealized losses on available-for-sale (\"AFS\") assets of $190 million, and $166 million from the repurchase and cancellation of common shares, partially offset by total net income of $605 million and foreign currency translation gain of $313 million included in other comprehensive income (loss).\nSLF Inc. and its wholly-owned holding companies had $1,654 million in cash and other liquid assets as at March 31, 2018 ($2,019 million as at December 31, 2017). The decrease in cash and other liquid assets in these holding companies in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to the repayment of $400 million of subordinated debentures detailed below. Other liquid assets as noted above include cash equivalents, short-term investments, and publicly traded securities.\nSun Life Assurance, SLF Inc.'s principal operating life insurance subsidiary in Canada, is also subject to the LICAT guideline. As at March 31, 2018, Sun Life Assurance's LICAT ratio was 139% well above OSFI's supervisory ratio of 100% and regulatory minimum ratio of 90%. A dividend of $1,200 million from Sun Life Assurance to SLF Inc. was declared subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2018. If this dividend had been declared on March 31, 2018, it would have reduced the Sun Life Assurance LICAT ratio by approximately 7 percentage points.\nOn January 30, 2018, SLF Inc. redeemed all of the outstanding $400 million principal amount of Series 2008-1 Subordinated Unsecured 5.59% Fixed/Floating Debentures at a redemption price equal to the principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest to that date.\nNormal Course Issuer Bid\nOn August 14, 2017, SLF Inc. launched a normal course issuer bid under which it is authorized to purchase up to 11.5 million common shares between August 14, 2017 and August 13, 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, SLF Inc. purchased and cancelled approximately 3.1 million common shares at a total cost of $166 million. During 2017, SLF Inc. purchased and cancelled approximately 3.5 million common shares at a total cost of $175 million.\nF.

Underlying net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $295 million, compared to $229 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nReported net income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily affected by unfavourable market related impacts, largely as a result of equity market changes. Underlying net income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 increased largely due to interest on par seed capital of $75 million, as well as positive investment experience, partially offset by unfavourable mortality and morbidity experience.\nGrowth\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nFollowing a strong sales quarter in 2017 as a result of the tax legislation and product design changes, SLF Canada individual insurance sales decreased in the first quarter of 2018 to $88 million, compared to $144 million. Sales in Group Benefits of $208 million decreased 32% compared to the first quarter of 2017, due to a large case sale in the first quarter of 2017.\nSLF Canada wealth sales of $3.8 billion in the first quarter of 2018 were down compared to $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower GRS sales. GRS sales of $2.0 billion decreased by 25% compared to the same quarter of the prior year, due to fewer large case defined contribution sales in the first quarter of 2018.\nIndividual wealth sales of $1.8 billion were 5% above the same quarter of the prior year with continued growth from our wealth manufactured(1) products.\n(1)\nRepresents sales of individual wealth products developed by Sun Life Financial, which include Sun Life Global Investment mutual funds, Sun Life Guaranteed Investment Funds segregated funds, Guaranteed Investment Certificates, and Accumulation and Payout Annuities.\n2.

Underlying net income was US$102 million ($129 million), compared to US$45 million ($59 million) in the first quarter of 2017. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar in the first quarter of 2018 relative to average exchange rates in the first quarter of 2017 decreased reported net income and underlying net income by $5 million and $6 million, respectively.\nReported net income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to reported net income in the first quarter of 2017 reflected unfavourable market related impacts primarily driven by interest rates and an increase in the unfavourable impact of changes in fair value of real estate. Underlying net income improved compared to the first quarter of 2017, benefiting from the interest on par seed capital by US$28 million ($35 million) in the first quarter of 2018 within In-force Management, and favourable morbidity experience, investment activity, and the lower income tax rate in the U.S., partially offset by unfavourable lapse and other policyholder behavior experience in In-force Management and unfavourable mortality experience in Group Benefits.

SLF Asset Management had underlying net income of $231 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $183 million in the first quarter of 2017. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar in the first quarter of 2018 relative to average exchange rates in the first quarter of 2017 decreased reported net income and underlying net income by $9 million and $10 million, respectively.\nSLF Asset Management's higher reported net income, compared to the same quarter in 2017, reflected higher average net assets and the lower income tax rate in the U.S., partially offset by Fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards.\nIn U.S. dollars, MFS's reported net income was US$159 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to US$124 million in the first quarter of 2017. MFS's underlying net income was US$176 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to US$133 million in the first quarter of 2017. MFS's reported net income and underlying net income compared to the first quarter of 2017 reflected higher average net assets and the lower income tax rate in the U.S. MFS's pre-tax net operating profit margin ratio was 38% in the first quarter of 2018, up from 36% in the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher average net assets.\nGrowth\nSLF Asset Management's AUM was $681.7 billion as at March 31, 2018, compared to $677.6 billion as at December 31, 2017. The increase in AUM was primarily due to currency impact, partially offset by asset depreciation and net outflows. MFS's AUM was US$482.2 billion ($621.6 billion) as at March 31, 2018, compared to US$491.6 billion ($618.3 billion) as at December 31, 2017. The decrease of US$9.4 billion was primarily driven by redemptions of US$27.7 billion and asset depreciation of US$5.1 billion, partially offset by gross sales of US$23.4 billion.\nMFS ranked second out of approximately 50 firms in the Barron's 2017 Fund Family Rankings for ten-year firm- wide performance for the third consecutive year. In the first quarter of 2018, 83%, 84% and 91% of MFS's retail fund assets ranked in the top half of their Lipper categories based on three-, five-, and ten-year performance, respectively.\nSLIM's AUM was $60.1 billion as at March 31, 2018, compared to $59.3 billion as at December 31, 2017.\n4.

See section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document.\nProfitability\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nSLF Asia's reported net income, including the International business unit, was $133 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to reported net income of $85 million in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying net income was $128 million, compared to $97 million in the first quarter of 2017. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar in the first quarter of 2018 relative to average exchange rates in the first quarter of 2017 reduced both reported net income and underlying net income by $7 million.\nReported net income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 reflected favourable market related impacts due to favourable credit spread changes partially offset by unfavourable equity market movements. Underlying net income in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017, reflected strong business growth.\nAs a result of a revision of the capital allocation model for SLF Asia, reported and underlying ROEs for SLF Asia both increased approximately 1.4% in the first quarter of 2018. The remaining increases in SLF Asia's ROEs reflected business growth in the first quarter of 2018.\nGrowth\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nSLF Asia insurance sales were $233 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $200 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total individual insurance sales increased 14%, driven by double-digit growth in all markets except Hong Kong and International, which had lower sales compared to strong 2017 results. On a constant currency basis, individual insurance sales increased 18%.\nSLF Asia wealth sales were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The continued growth momentum in wealth sales was led by our pensions business in Hong Kong, equity and fixed income funds in our Indian joint venture mutual fund company, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited, and our asset management company in the Philippines.\n5.

Acquisition, integration and restructuring amounts for the fourth quarter of 2017 consisted primarily of the impact of the restructuring charge related to Company's plan to enhance business processes and organizational structures and capabilities. The Acquisition, integration and restructuring amounts were $(3) million, $(50) million, and $(2) million for the first quarter of 2018, fourth quarter of 2017, and first quarter of 2017, respectively.\n(4)\nRepresents a non-IFRS financial measure. See section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document.\nProfitability\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nReported net loss in Corporate was $19 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to reported net income of $4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying net loss was $13 million, compared to underlying net income of $5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The reported net loss and underlying net loss reflected an increase in expenses, and tax related items, partially offset by favourable investing activity experience in the U.K.\nSLF U.K.'s reported net income in the first quarter of 2018 increased compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to favourable investing activity, partially offset by the impact of ACMA and less favourable mortality experience.\nCorporate Support had a reported net loss of $67 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a reported net loss of $41 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in loss was primarily due to higher regulatory related expenses (including the adoption of LICAT and the IFRS 17 initiative) and tax related items.\nG. Investments\nWe had total general fund invested assets of $146.2 billion as at March 31, 2018, compared to $146.1 billion as at December 31, 2017. The increase in general fund invested assets was primarily due to changes in the currency impact from the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to exchange rates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an increase in operating activity, offset by a decline in net fair value. Our general fund invested assets are well diversified across investment types, geographies and sectors with the majority of our portfolio invested in fixed income high quality assets.\nThe following table sets out the composition of our general fund invested assets.

Generally, the carrying values for Fair value through profit or loss (\"FVTPL\") and AFS invested assets are equal to their fair values; however our mortgages and loans are generally carried at amortized cost. For invested assets supporting insurance contracts, in the event of default, if the amounts recovered are insufficient to satisfy the related insurance contract liability cash flows that the assets are intended to support, credit exposure may be greater than the carrying value of the assets.\n1. Debt Securities\nOur debt securities portfolio is actively managed through a regular program of purchases and sales aimed at optimizing yield, quality and liquidity, while ensuring that it remains well diversified and duration-matched to insurance contract liabilities. With the exception of certain countries where we have business operations, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, our exposure to debt securities from any single country did not exceed 1% of total invested assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as at March 31, 2018.\nThe carrying value of FVTPL and AFS debt securities by geographic location is presented in the following table.\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n($ millions)\nFVTPL\ndebt\nsecurities\nAFS debt\nsecurities\nTotal\n% of Total\nFVTPL\ndebt\nsecurities\nAFS debt\nsecurities\nTotal\n% of Total\nDebt securities\nCanada\n24,661\n4,351\n29,012\n40%\n24,132\n4,114\n28,246\n39%\nUnited States\n20,140\n5,572\n25,712\n35%\n20,758\n5,719\n26,477\n36%\nEurope\n9,107\n1,331\n10,438\n14%\n8,923\n1,402\n10,325\n14%\nAsia\n3,506\n540\n4,046\n6%\n3,694\n571\n4,265\n6%\nOther\n2,447\n952\n3,399\n5%\n2,460\n846\n3,306\n5%\nTotal debt securities\n59,861\n12,746\n72,607\n100%\n59,967\n12,652\n72,619\n100%\nOur debt securities with a credit rating of \"A\" or higher represented 72.2% of the total debt securities as at March 31, 2018, compared to 70.6% as at December 31, 2017. Debt securities with a credit rating of \"BBB\" or higher represented 98.6% of total debt securities as at March 31, 2018, compared to 98.3% as at December 31, 2017.\nOur gross unrealized losses as at March 31, 2018 for FVTPL and AFS debt securities were $0.7 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, compared with $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, as at December 31, 2017. The increase in gross unrealized losses was largely due to the impact from rising interest rates and credit spreads.\n2. Mortgages and Loans\nMortgages and loans disclosures in this section are presented at their carrying value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Our mortgage portfolio consisted almost entirely of first mortgages and our loan portfolio consisted of private placement loans.\nThe carrying value of mortgages and loans by geographic location is presented in the following table.

Our mortgage portfolio consists entirely of commercial mortgages, including retail, office, multi-family, industrial and land properties. As at March 31, 2018, 30% of our commercial mortgage portfolio consisted of multi-family residential mortgages; there are no single family residential mortgages. Our uninsured commercial portfolio had a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 55% as at March 31, 2018, consistent with December 31, 2017. While we generally limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 75% at issuance, we may invest in mortgages with a higher loan-to-value ratio in Canada if the mortgage is insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (\"CMHC\"). The estimated weighted average debt service coverage for our uninsured commercial portfolio is 1.78 times. Of the $3.2 billion of multi-family residential mortgages in the Canadian commercial mortgage portfolio, 91% were insured by the CMHC.\nAs at March 31, 2018, we held $28.3 billion of loans, compared to $27.3 billion as at December 31, 2017. Private placement loans provide diversification by type of loan, industry segment and borrower credit quality. The private placement loan portfolio consists of senior secured and unsecured loans to large- and mid-market sized corporate borrowers, securitized lease/loan obligations secured by a variety of assets, and project finance loans in sectors such as power and infrastructure.\nMortgages and Loans Past Due or Impaired\nThe gross carrying value and allowance for mortgages and loans past due or impaired are presented in the following table.\nMarch 31, 2018\nGross carrying value\nAllowa nce for losses\n($ millions)\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nNot past due Past due:\n15,726\n28,205\n43,931\n—\n—\n—\nPast due less than 90 days\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nPast due 90 days or more\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nImpaired\n42\n153\n195\n23\n(1)\n30\n53\nTotal\n15,768\n28,358\n44,126\n23\n30\n53\nDecember 31, 2017\nGross carrying value\nAllowance for losses\n($ millions)\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nNot past due\n15,482\n27,180\n42,662\n—\n—\n—\nPast due:\nPast due less than 90 days\n—\n71\n71\n—\n—\n—\nPast due 90 days or more\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nImpaired\n33\n89\n122\n22\n(1)\n28\n50\nTotal\n15,515\n27,340\n42,855\n22\n28\n50\n(1)\nIncludes $20 million of sectoral provisions as at March 31, 2018, consistent with December 31, 2017.\nOur impaired mortgages and loans, net of allowance for losses, were $142 million as at March 31, 2018, compared to $72 million as at December 31, 2017. The increase of $70 million is driven from an increase in impaired loans which was primarily due to the addition of one creditor in the first quarter of 2018.\n3. Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe values associated with our derivative instruments are presented in the following table. Notional amounts serve as the basis for payments calculated under derivatives contracts and are generally not exchanged.\n($ millions)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet fair value asset (liability)\n(615)\n(278)\nTotal notional amount\n54,369\n54,121\nCredit equivalent amount (2)\n544\n561\nRisk-weighted credit equivalent amount (1)(2)\n14.2\nn/a\n(1)\nAs of March 31, 2018 the risk-weighted credit equivalent amount is calculated under the new LICAT guidelines which were effective January 1, 2018. LICAT ratios are not applicable before January 1, 2018.\n(2)\nAmounts presented are net of collateral received.\nThe total notional amount of our derivatives increased to $54.4 billion as at March 31, 2018 from $54.1 billion as at December 31, 2017.\nThe net fair value of derivatives was a liability of $615 million as at March 31, 2018, compared to a liability of $278 million as at December 31, 2017. The decrease in net fair value was primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange contracts, as well as the impact of upward shifts in the yield curves.\n4. Asset Default Provision\nWe make provisions for possible future credit events in the determination of our insurance contract liabilities. The amount of the provision for asset default included in insurance contract liabilities is based on possible reductions in future investment yields that vary by factors such as type of asset, asset credit quality (rating), duration and country of origin. To the extent that an asset is written off, or disposed of, any amounts that were set aside in our insurance contract liabilities for possible future asset defaults in respect of that asset are released.\nOur asset default provision reflects the provision relating to future credit events for fixed income assets currently held by the Company that support our insurance contract liabilities. Our asset default provision as at March 31, 2018 was $2,273 million compared to $2,288 million as at December 31, 2017. The decrease of $15 million was primarily due to the release of provisions on fixed income assets supporting our insurance contract liabilities and decrease due to yield curve movement, offset by weakening of the Canadian dollar and increases in the provision for assets purchased, net of dispositions.\nH. Risk Management\nThe Company has established a Risk Management Framework to assist in identifying, measuring, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Risk Management Framework covers all risks and these have been grouped into six major categories: credit, market, insurance, business and strategic, operational and liquidity risks.\nThrough our enterprise risk management processes, we oversee the various risk factors identified in the Risk Management Framework and provide reports to senior management and to the Board Committees at least quarterly. Our enterprise risk management processes and risk factors are described in our annual MD&A and AIF.\nWhen referring to segregated funds in this section, it is inclusive of segregated fund guarantees, variable annuities and investment products and includes Run-off reinsurance in our Corporate business segment.\n1. Market Risk Sensitivities\nOur net income (1) is affected by the determination of policyholder obligations under our annuity and insurance contracts. These amounts are determined using internal valuation models and are recorded in our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily as Insurance contract liabilities. The determination of these obligations requires management to make assumptions about the future level of equity market performance, interest rates, credit and swap spreads and other factors over the life of our products. Differences between our actual experience and our best estimate assumptions are reflected in our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to Sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates.\nThe market value of our investments in fixed income and equity securities fluctuates based on movements in interest rates and equity markets. The market value of fixed income assets designated as AFS that are held primarily in our surplus segment increases with declining interest rates and decreases with rising interest rates. The market value of equities designated as AFS and held primarily in our surplus segment increases (decreases) with rising (declining) equity markets. Changes in the market value of AFS assets flow through other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and are only recognized in net income when realized upon sale, or when considered impaired. The amount of realized gains (losses) recorded in net income in any period is equal to the unrealized gains (losses) or OCI position at the start of the period plus the change in market value during the current period up to the point of sale for those securities that were sold during the period. The sale or impairment of AFS assets held in surplus can therefore have the effect of modifying our net income sensitivity.\nWe realized $36 million (pre-tax) in net gains on the sale of AFS assets during the first quarter of 2018 ($55 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2017). The net unrealized gains or OCI position on AFS fixed income and equity assets were $44 million and $112 million, respectively, after-tax as at March 31, 2018 ($171 million and $175 million, respectively, after-tax as at December 31, 2017).\n(1)\nNet Income refers to common shareholders' net income in section H- risk Management in this document.\nEquity Market Sensitivities\nThe following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of our net income and OCI, and Sun Life Assurance's LICAT ratio to certain instantaneous changes in equity market prices as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nAs at March 31, 2018\n($ millions, unless otherwise noted)\nChange in Equity Markets (1)\n25% decrease\n10% decrease\n10% increase\n25% increase\nPotential impact on net income (2)(3)\n$\n(300)\n$\n(100)\n$\n100\n$\n300\nPotential impact on OCI (3)\n$\n(200)\n$\n(50)\n$\n50\n$\n200\nPotential impact on LICAT (2)(4)\n2.0% point\ndecrease\n0.5% point\ndecrease\n0.5% point\nincrease\n1.5% point\nincrease\nAs at December 31, 2017\n($ millions, unless otherwise noted)\nChange in Equity Markets (1)\n25% decrease\n10% decrease\n10% increase\n25% increase\nPotential impact on net income (2)(3)\n$\n(300)\n$\n(100)\n$\n100\n$\n300\nPotential impact on OCI (3)\n$\n(200)\n$\n(50)\n$\n50\n$\n200\nPotential impact on LICAT (2)(4)\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n(1)\nRepresents the respective change across all equity markets as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Assumes that actual equity exposures consistently and precisely track the broader equity markets. Since in actual practice equity-related exposures generally differ from broad market indices (due to the impact of active management, basis risk, and other factors), realized sensitivities may differ significantly from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2% intervals (for 10% changes in equity markets) and at 5% intervals (for 25% changes in equity markets).\n(2)\nThe market risk sensitivities include the estimated mitigation impact of our hedging programs in effect as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and include new business added and product changes implemented prior to such dates.\n(3)\nNet income and OCI sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $50 million. The sensitivities exclude the market impacts on the income from our joint ventures and associates, which we account for on an equity basis.\n(4)\nThe LICAT sensitivities illustrate the impact on Sun Life Assurance as at March 31, 2018. LICAT ratios are not applicable before January 1, 2018. LICAT ratios are rounded to the nearest 0.5%.\nInterest Rate Sensitivities\nThe following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of our net income and OCI, and Sun Life Assurance's LICAT ratio to certain instantaneous changes in interest rates as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nOur LICAT ratio decreases with rising interest rates and increases with declining interest rates, which is opposite to our net income sensitivity. Increases to interest rates will reduce the value of our assets and margins in our actuarial liabilities, resulting in a lower LICAT ratio. LICAT includes the change in OCI associated with assets designated as AFS. Given the change in the sensitivity profile as a result of LICAT, the ranges of sensitivities were reviewed and updated accordingly.\n($ millions, unless otherwise noted)\nAs at March 31, 2018\nAs at December 31, 2017\nChange in Interest Rates (1)\n50 basis point\ndecrease\n50 basis point\nincrease\n50 basis point\ndecrease\n50 basis point\nincrease\nPotential impact on net income (2)(3)(4)\n$\n(100)\n$\n50\n$\n(100)\n$\n50\nPotential impact on OCI (3)\n$\n300\n$\n(300)\n$\n250\n$\n(250)\nPotential impact on LICAT (2)(5)\n3.0% point\nincrease\n4.0% point\ndecrease\nn/a\nn/a\n(1)\nInterest rate sensitivities assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 with no change to the Actuarial Standards Board (\"ASB\") promulgated Ultimate Reinvestment Rate (\"URR\"). Variations in realized yields based on factors such as different terms to maturity and geographies may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing interest rate hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 10 basis point intervals (for 50 basis point changes in interest rates).\n(2)\nThe market risk sensitivities include the estimated mitigation impact of our hedging programs in effect as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and include new business added and product changes implemented prior to such dates.\n(3)\nNet income and OCI sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $50 million. The sensitivities exclude the market impacts on the income from our joint ventures and associates, which we account for on an equity basis.\n(4)\nThe majority of interest rate sensitivity, after hedging, is attributed to individual insurance products. We also have interest rate sensitivity, after hedging, from our fixed annuity and segregated funds products.\n(5)\nThe LICAT sensitivities illustrate the impact on Sun Life Assurance as at March 31, 2018. LICAT ratios are not applicable before January 1, 2018. LICAT ratios are rounded to the nearest 0.5%.\n2. Credit Spread and Swap Spread Sensitivities\nWe have estimated the immediate impact or sensitivity of our net income attributable to certain instantaneous changes in credit and swap spreads. The credit spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in credit spread on our asset and liability valuations (including non-sovereign fixed income assets, provincial governments, corporate bonds, and other fixed income assets). The swap spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in swap spreads on swap-based derivative positions and liability valuations.\n($ millions, unless otherwise noted)\nCredit Spread Sensitivities (1)\nSwap Spread Sensitivities\nNet income sensitivity (2)\n50 basis point\ndecrease\n50 basis point\nincrease\n20 basis point\ndecrease\n20 basis point\nincrease\nMarch 31, 2018\n$\n(100)\n$\n100\n$\n50\n$\n(50)\nDecember 31, 2017\n$\n(100)\n$\n100\n$\n25\n$\n(25)\n(1)\nIn most instances, credit spreads are assumed to revert to long-term insurance contract liability assumptions generally over a five-year period.\n(2)\nSensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $25 million.\nThe credit and swap spread sensitivities assume a parallel shift in the indicated spreads across the entire term structure. Variations in realized spread changes based on different terms to maturity, geographies, asset classes and derivative types, underlying interest rate movements, and ratings may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those provided above. The credit spread sensitivity estimates exclude any credit spread impact that may arise in connection with asset positions held in segregated funds. Spread sensitivities are provided for the consolidated entity and may not be proportional across all reporting segments. Refer to Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to Sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates.\n3. General Account Insurance and Annuity Products\nMost of our expected sensitivity to changes in interest rates and about two-thirds of our expected sensitivity to changes in equity markets are derived from our general account insurance and annuity products. We have implemented market risk management strategies to mitigate a portion of the market risk related to our general account insurance and annuity products.\nIndividual insurance products include universal life and other long-term life and health insurance products. Major sources of market risk exposure for individual insurance products include the reinvestment risk related to future premiums on regular premium policies, asset reinvestment risk on both regular premium and single premium policies and the guaranteed cost of insurance. Interest rate risk for individual insurance products is typically managed on a duration basis, within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment policy or guidelines. Targets and limits are established so that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite. Exposures are monitored frequently, and assets are re-balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within policy limits using a combination of assets and derivative instruments. A portion of the longer-term cash flows are backed with equities and real estate.\nFor participating insurance products and other insurance products with adjustability features, the investment strategy objective is to provide a total rate of return given a constant risk profile over the long term.\nFixed annuity products generally provide the policyholder with a guaranteed investment return or crediting rate. Interest rate risk for these products is typically managed on a duration basis, within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment guidelines. Targets and limits are established such that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite. Exposures are monitored frequently, and are re-balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within prescribed tolerances using a combination of fixed income assets and derivative instruments.\nCertain insurance and annuity products contain minimum interest rate guarantees. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit potential financial loss due to reductions in asset earned rates relative to contract guarantees. These typically involve the use of hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest rate floors, swaps and swaptions.\nCertain insurance and annuity products contain features which allow the policyholders to surrender their policy at book value. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss due to changes in interest rate levels and policyholder behaviour. These typically involve the use of hedging strategies such as dynamic option replication and the purchase of interest rate swaptions.\nCertain products have guaranteed minimum annuitization rates. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss and typically involve the use of fixed income assets, interest rate swaps, and swaptions.\n4. Segregated Fund Guarantees\nApproximately one-third of our equity market sensitivity and a small amount of interest rate risk sensitivity as at March 31, 2018 are derived from segregated fund products. These products provide benefit guarantees, which are linked to underlying fund performance and may be triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. The cost of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of factors including general capital market conditions, our hedging strategies, policyholder behaviour and mortality experience, each of which may result in negative impacts on net income and capital.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the guarantees provided for our segregated fund products.\nAs at March 31, 2018\nValue of\nInsurance contract\n($ millions)\nFund value\nAmount at Risk (1)\nguarantees (2)\nliabilities (3)\nSLF Canada\n12,099\n391\n10,807\n434\nSLF Asia (4)\n3,519\n285\n3,629\n99\nRun-off reinsurance (5)\n2,510\n391\n1,556\n374\nTotal\n18,128\n1,067\n15,992\n907\nAs at December 31, 2017\nValue of\nInsurance contract\n($ millions)\nFund value\nAmount at Risk (1)\nguarantees (2)\nliabilities (3)\nSLF Canada\n12,448\n315\n10,875\n399\nSLF Asia (4)\n3,727\n250\n3,755\n107\nRun-off reinsurance (5)\n2,534\n375\n1,546\n385\nTotal\n18,709\n940\n16,176\n891\n(1)\nThe Amount at Risk represents the excess of the value of the guarantees over fund values on all policies where the value of the guarantees exceeds the fund value. The Amount at Risk is not currently payable as the guarantees are only payable upon death, maturity, withdrawal, or annuitization if fund values remain below guaranteed values.\n(2)\nFor guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits, the value of guarantees is calculated as the present value of the maximum future withdrawals assuming market conditions remain unchanged from current levels. For all other benefits, the value of guarantees is determined assuming 100% of the claims are made at the valuation date.\n(3)\nThe insurance contract liabilities represent management's provision for future costs associated with these guarantees and include a provision for adverse deviation in accordance with Canadian actuarial standards of practice.\n(4)\nEffective January 1, 2018, we transferred our International business unit from SLF U.S. to SLF Asia, and balances in 2017 have been changed to conform with the current year presentation. For further information, see section F - Performance by Business Group in this document.\n(5)\nThe Run-off reinsurance business includes risks assumed through reinsurance of variable annuity products issued by various North American insurance companies between 1997 and 2001. This line of business is part of a closed block of reinsurance, which is included in the Corporate segment.\nThe movement of the items in the table above from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 primarily resulted from the following factors:\n(i)\nthe total fund values decreased due to unfavourable equity market movements and net redemptions from legacy business, which was partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar;\n(ii)\nthe amount at risk increased due to unfavourable equity market movements and the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, which was partially offset by net redemptions from legacy business;\n(iii)\nthe total value of guarantees decreased due to net redemptions from legacy business, which was partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and\n(iv)\nthe total insurance contract liabilities increased due to unfavourable equity market movements and the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.\n5. Segregated Fund Hedging\nOur hedging programs use derivative instruments to mitigate the interest and equity related exposure of our segregated fund contracts. As at March 31, 2018, over 90% of our segregated fund contracts, as measured by associated fund values, were included in a hedging program. While a large percentage of contracts are included in the hedging program, not all of our market risk exposure related to these contracts is hedged. For those segregated fund contracts included in the hedging program, we generally hedge the value of expected future net claims costs and associated margins.\nThe following table illustrates the impact of our hedging program related to our sensitivity to a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates and a 10% and 25% decrease in equity markets for segregated fund contracts as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nImpact of Segregated Fund Hedging\nMarch 31, 2018\n($ millions)\nChanges in interest rates (1)\nChanges in equity markets (2)\nNet income sensitivity (3)(4)\n50 basis point decrease\n10% decrease\n25% decrease\nBefore hedging\n(200)\n(150)\n(450)\nHedging impact\n200\n100\n350\nNet of hedging\n—\n(50)\n(100)\nDecember 31, 2017\n($ millions)\nChanges in interest rates (1)\nChanges in equity markets (2)\nNet income sensitivity (3)(4)\n50 basis point decrease\n10% decrease\n25% decrease\nBefore hedging\n(200)\n(150)\n(450)\nHedging impact\n200\n100\n350\nNet of hedging\n—\n(50)\n(100)\n(1)\nRepresents a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, with no change to the ASB promulgated URR. Variations in realized yields based on factors such as different terms to maturity and geographies may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing interest rate hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 10 basis point intervals (for 50 basis point changes in interest rates).\n(2)\nRepresents the change across all equity markets as at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Assumes that actual equity exposures consistently and precisely track the broader equity markets. Since in actual practice equity-related exposures generally differ from broad market indices (due to the impact of active management, basis risk, and other factors), realized sensitivities may differ significantly from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2% intervals (for 10% changes in equity markets) and at 5% intervals (for 25% changes in equity markets).\n(3)\nNet income sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $50 million.\n(4)\nSince the fair value of benefits being hedged will generally differ from the financial statement value (due to different valuation methods and the inclusion of valuation margins in respect of financial statement values), this will result in residual volatility to interest rate and equity market shocks in net income and capital. The general availability and cost of these hedging instruments may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including volatile and declining equity and interest rate market conditions.\n6. Real Estate Risk\nReal estate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from fluctuations in the value of, or future cash flows from our investments in real estate. We are exposed to real estate risk and may experience financial losses resulting from the direct ownership of real estate investments or indirectly through fixed income investments secured by real estate property, leasehold interests, ground rents, and purchase and leaseback transactions. Real estate price risk may arise from external market conditions, inadequate property analysis, inadequate insurance coverage, inappropriate real estate appraisals, or from environmental risk exposures. We hold direct real estate investments that support general account liabilities and surplus, and fluctuations in value will impact our profitability and financial position. A material and sustained increase in interest rates may lead to deterioration in real estate values. An instantaneous 10% decrease in the value of our direct real estate investments as at March 31, 2018 would decrease net income (1) by approximately $275 million ($250 million decrease as at December 31, 2017).\nConversely, an instantaneous 10% increase in the value of our direct real estate investments as at March 31, 2018 would increase net income by approximately $275 million ($250 million increase as at December 31, 2017).", "external_links": ["http://www.sec.gov/", "http://www.mfs.com/CorpFact", "http://www.sunlife.com/", "http://www.sedar.com/"], "published": "2018-05-09T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T02:49:12.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
