(NASDAQ:SMRT) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018 and raised its first half 2018 outlook.\nNet income for the first quarter was $7.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to a net income of $3.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share in 2017. Operating income for the first quarter was $9.9 million compared to $10.1 million in 2017. First quarter 2018 results include less than $0.1 million in income tax expense (see Income Taxes below).\nAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the first quarter was $18.4 million compared to $19.3 million in 2017 (see Note 1).\n“Comparative sales trends showed considerable improvement for the quarter and operating income exceeded our expectations. Continuing strong inventory productivity drove a significantly higher gross profit rate. The higher gross profit and our below-plan expenses more than offset the impact of somewhat lower sales,” said Hunt Hawkins, Chief Executive Officer. “With better first quarter results, we now expect first-half operating income to be in excess of $10 million instead of the $8 million we previously discussed. Also, while it is early in the second quarter, we are pleased with May’s positive comparable sales trend which reflects the return of seasonal temperatures.”\nNet Sales\nTotal sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $326.7 million, a decrease of 3.2 percent compared with $337.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in total sales includes the impact of six stores closed in 2017 and four stores closed during the first quarter of 2018. Comparable store sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 0.7 percent including sales from leased departments (see Note 2). Ecommerce sales were up 85 percent over last year’s first quarter.\nOther Revenue\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). As a result of the new accounting standard, income relating to our credit card program and gift card breakage that previously offset selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses has been recorded in other revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. The increase in other revenue for the first quarter of 2018 is the result of higher penetration from our growing credit card program.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $96.1 million or 29.4 percent of sales compared to $95.6 million or 28.3 percent of sales in 2017. The 110 basis points expansion in the gross profit rate was driven primarily by higher gross margin from reduced markdowns and better inventory productivity. Occupancy costs were flat for the quarter, but higher as a percentage of sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $90.5 million compared to $89.2 million in 2017. The slight increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to planned higher advertising and Ecommerce expenses in the first quarter of 2018 that were mostly offset by cost savings.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.5 million compared to $1.1 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense reflects higher interest rates and borrowing levels in the first quarter of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense decreased $5.2 million to less than $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The decrease reflects our net operating loss carry forward position along with the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 expense represents certain state income tax expense. We expect the effective tax rate to be close to zero percent for all of 2018.\nWorking Capital and Capital Expenditures\nInventories were $297 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to $322 million at the same time last year. Average inventories per store were down nearly 10 percent to last year.\nCapital expenditures totaled $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $7.2 million in 2017. For fiscal 2018, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $10 million compared to $21 million in fiscal 2017.\nAccounts payable decreased more than $68 million compared to the end of the first quarter last year as a result of reduced credit terms from our vendors and their factors. Our availability under our expanded credit facility allowed us to fund this reduction and keep merchandise receipts timely. Borrowings increased to $209 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $157 million at the end of last year’s first quarter. Unused availability at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was $40 million. Credit terms began expanding late in the quarter after we announced positive fourth quarter 2017 results.\nStore Activity\nWe had 289 stores at the end of the first quarter 2018 compared to 292 at the end of the first quarter last year. We closed four stores during the first quarter of 2018. We are now expecting to close a total of seven stores and open two new stores in 2018.\nUpdated First Half 2018 Outlook\nWe now expect first half 2018 operating income to be in excess of $10 million compared to an operating loss of $11.5 million for the first half of 2017. Our outlook has improved due to first quarter results along with expected additional first-half gross profit expansion and lower SG&A expenses. Second quarter of 2018 operating income is expected to be positive based on the following factors:\nWe anticipate flat to low single-digit increases in comparable sales for the second quarter driven by much higher regular-price selling We expect gross profit expansion in excess of 400 basis points SG&A expenses are expected to be at least $5 million lower, inclusive of higher Ecommerce expenses\nFiling of Form 10-Q\nReported results are preliminary and not final until the filing of our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May 5, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and therefore remain subject to adjustment.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss the Company’s first quarter results will be held at 4:30 p.m. ET on May 23, 2018.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company’s financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance.\nNote 1: Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. However, we present EBITDA in this release because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance and because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and others to evaluate the performance of companies. EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies. EBITDA should be used as a supplement to results of operations and cash flows as reported under GAAP and should not be considered to be a more meaningful measure than, or an alternative to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA which are considered Non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash items (impairment charges), significant non-recurring unusual items and new stores investments (pre-opening costs).\n13 Weeks 13 Weeks Ended Ended May 5, 2018 Apr. 29, 2017 Net income $7,334 $3,700 Add back amounts for computation of EBITDA: Interest expense, net 2,463 1,139 Income tax expense 60 5,223 Depreciation and amortization 8,070 8,085 EBITDA 17,927 18,147 Adjustments: Non-cash impairment charges 299 31 Expense related to legal settlements 11 25 New store pre-opening costs 192 1,131 Total adjustments 502 1,187 Adjusted EBITDA $18,429 $19,334 Note 2: Changes in Comparable Store Sales\nManagement believes that providing calculations of changes in comparable sales including and excluding sales from leased departments assists in evaluating the Company’s ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments leased to third parties. The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of these calculations.\n13 Weeks 13 Weeks\nEnded Ended May 5, 2018 Apr. 29, 2017 Decrease in comparable sales excluding sales from leased departments (1) (1.8%) (7.6%) Impact of growth in comparable sales of leased departments (2) 1.1% 0.5% Decrease in comparable store sales including sales from leased departments (0.7%) (7.1%) (1) Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores open throughout the period presented and the same period in the prior year and all online sales of steinmart.com , excluding commissions from departments leased to third parties.\n(2) Represents the impact of including sales of departments leased to third parties throughout the period presented and the same period in the prior year and all online sales of steinmart.com in the calculation of comparable sales. The company leases its shoe and vintage handbag departments in its stores and online to third parties and receives a commission from these third parties based on a percentage of their sales. In our financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The Company does not include the commission amounts from leased department sales in its comparable sales calculations.\nFor more information:\nLinda L.
