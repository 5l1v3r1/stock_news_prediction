We provide rich data analytics to uncover areas for optimization and deliver a platform that is responsive and flexible to adapt to the ever-changing nature of global trade.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, Amber Road has provided non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP guidance within this press release including non-GAAP adjusted operating and net loss and adjusted EBITDA, financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Provided below is a reconciliation of GAAP operating and net loss to non-GAAP adjusted operating and net loss, and net loss to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA consists of net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense (income) and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA plus stock-based compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liability. Amber Road has included these non-GAAP measures in this press release because it assists in comparing performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it removes from operating results the impact of the Company’s capital structure. Amber Road believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to an investor in evaluating its operating performance because they are often used by the financial community to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, and to present a meaningful measure of performance exclusive of its capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\nAmber Road’s use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of its results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and these non-GAAP measures do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; these non-GAAP measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; these non-GAAP measures do not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available; and other companies, including companies in Amber Road’s industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider these non-GAAP measures together with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and other GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP operating and net loss to non-GAAP adjusted operating and net loss, and adjusted EBITDA has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our current expectations and beliefs, and therefore, contain risks and uncertainties about future events or our future financial performance, including, but not limited to, achieving revenue from bookings, closing business from the sales pipeline, new customer deployments and maintaining these relationships, the ability to reduce operating losses and use of cash, and attaining profitability. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are only predictions and may be inaccurate. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks outlined in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, without limitation, our annual, periodic and current SEC reports. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the reasonable, our future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements may differ from our expectations. Other than as required by law, we do not undertake to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, even though our situation may change in the future.\nAMBER ROAD, INC.
