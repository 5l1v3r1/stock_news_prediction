We were like ‘oh my God,’ so we bought more, then we bought more. It’s like amazing ... really overwhelming,” she said.\nMadeley said British and Americans alike were snapping up souvenirs ahead of the May 19 wedding in England.\nIn the small store, life size cardboard cut-outs of Markle and Harry stand amid Union Jack flags, commemorative plates and teacups.\nRoyal-themed teaspoons, coasters, key rings and shopping bags are displayed among British favorites like Marmite, PG Tips tea bags and Cadbury chocolate.\nMarkle’s California connections have added to the fascination - she was born and raised in Los Angeles.\nHolly Gottlieb, 28, a recent transplant from London, said, “My colleagues are all American. They love it way more than I.”\nReporting by Reuters Television\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:46:39.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
