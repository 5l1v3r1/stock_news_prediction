Moody, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of National Western Life Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: NWLI), announced today first quarter 2018 consolidated net earnings of $26.9 million, or $7.60 per diluted Class A common share, compared with consolidated net earnings of $23.5 million, or $6.65 per diluted Class A common share, for 2017. The Company's book value per share as of March 31, 2018 was $502.79.\nThe Company reported earnings from operations, excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, of $26.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or $7.46 per diluted Class A common share, compared to $21.9 million, or $6.18 per diluted Class A common share in the same period for 2017. Mr. Moody commented on the results saying, \"Our operating earnings for the quarter benefited from the lower corporate tax rate provided by the tax act enacted last December. On a pretax basis, our operating earnings also registered an increase over last year's quarter reflecting our ongoing efforts toward expense containment and management of our spread margins on our interest-sensitive product portfolio.\"\nInsurance revenues, excluding gains and losses on investments and index options, of $152.8 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 declined 5% from 2017 amount reflecting lower surrender charge revenue in the current quarter and non-recurring investment income received in the prior year first quarter. Mr. Moody indicated, \"We recognize revenue in the current reporting period from surrender charges assessed against policyholders who withdraw funds; however, it is far better from a long-term profitability standpoint to have those policies and values remain on our books. The lapse rates on our life insurance business showed a noticeable improvement in this year. While this is preferable, it does result in lower revenues being reported currently.\" Mr. Moody added that current life insurance sales will manifest in future period revenues. \"We had a very strong start to our life sales in the first quarter. Domestic life insurance sales, which have been a focal point of the company, increased 38% in the first quarter over last year,\" Mr. Moody noted.\nNational Western Life Group, Inc. is the parent organization of National Western Life Insurance Company (NWLIC).
