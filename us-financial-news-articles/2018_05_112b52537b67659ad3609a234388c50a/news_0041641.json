It’s America!” he shouts in the video, which has garnered more than 5.4 million views.\n“My guess is they are not documented so my next call is to ICE to ask each of them to get out of my country,” he says, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n“I pay for their welfare - the least they can do is speak English,” he said.\nOther customers are heard on the video denouncing what they describe as his racist comments.\nThe tirade went viral at a time when many Americans are frustrated by what they view as a wave of illegal immigration into the United States, a sentiment that Donald Trump exploited in his successful campaign for the presidency.\nA petition started on Change.org on Thursday urges the New York State Bar Association and the First Judicial Department Attorneys Grievance Committee to disbar the man, whom it names and identifies as a lawyer. As of late Thursday afternoon, more than 12,000 people had signed the petition.\nThe bar association said complaints against attorneys are investigated by grievance committees appointed by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.\nNeither the man nor the appellate division immediately responded to Reuters’ requests for comment. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Fresh Kitchen for comment.\nReporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Frank McGurty and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:25:49.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
