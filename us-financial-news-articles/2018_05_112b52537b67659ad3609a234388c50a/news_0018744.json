All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nRevenues of $20.4 million in Q1, 2018 compared with revenues of $15.2 million in Q1, 2017. Previously announced, consolidated silver production for the quarter of approximately 1.6 million silver equivalent 1 ounces, an increase of 46% when compared to Q1 2017, including approximately 400,000 silver ounces. A net income of $0.5 million or 0.01 cents per share in Q1, 2018 after Zone 120 exploration expenses of $1.8 million, compared with a net loss of ($0.2) million or ($0.01) cent per share in Q1, 2017. Previously announced, consolidated cash costs 2 were approximately negative ($2.73) per silver ounce, a decrease of 128% year-over-year, while consolidated all-in sustaining costs 3 (“AISC”) were approximately $6.17 per silver ounce, a decrease of 54% year-over-year. Cash flow generated from operating activities 3 in Q1, 2018 of approximately $3.7 million after exploration costs compared to cash flow used in operating activities of approximately $0.5 million in Q4, 2017. Cash balance at March 31, 2018 of $3.3 million with net working capital of approximately $10.9 million; long-term debt decreasing to $9.6 million. Guidance for 2018 remains unchanged at 1.6 – 2.0 million silver ounces and 7.2 – 8.0 million silver equivalent ounces at cash costs of negative ($10.00) to negative ($5.00) per silver ounce and all-in sustaining cash costs of negative ($1.00) to $4.00 per silver ounce.\n“The Company had a solid first quarter with increases in consolidated revenue, net income, and silver equivalent production with significant decreases in cash costs and AISC,” said Americas Silver Corporation President and CEO Darren Blasutti. “San Rafael continued to ramp up its mining rate and milling rate throughout the quarter while advancing development into the higher-grade Main Zone with the expectation of reaching a milling rate of 1,700 tonnes per day in the second half of the year. Exploration cost of $1.8 million during the quarter was spent primarily on the very successful 12,000-meter drill program at Zone 120 designed to expand and upgrade previously reported resources, expected to be released in Q3 2018.”\nConsolidated Production and Operating Costs\nConsolidated Production and Cost Details Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Total ore processed (tonnes milled) 163,875 167,493 Silver produced (ounces) 397,035 523,747 Zinc produced (pounds) 7,332,978 2,389,133 Lead produced (pounds) 7,624,685 6,160,732 Copper produced (pounds) - 308,100 Silver equivalent produced (ounces) 1,613,711 1,104,237 Silver recovery (percent) 79.3 90.5 Silver grade (grams per tonne) 95 107 Silver sold (ounces) 404,649 528,827 Zinc sold (pounds) 7,259,622 2,500,550 Lead sold (pounds) 7,895,231 6,119,207 Copper sold (pounds) - 295,336 Cost of sales ($ per silver equivalent ounce) 1 $8.14 $9.93 Silver cash cost ($ per silver ounce) 1 ($2.73) $9.89 All-in sustaining cost ($ per silver ounce) 1 $6.17 $13.37 1 Cost of sales per silver equivalent ounce, cash costs per silver ounce, and all-in sustaining costs per silver ounce in Q1, 2017 excludes pre-production of 62,714 silver ounces, and 88,656 silver equivalent ounces mined from El Cajón during its commissioning period. Pre-production revenue and cost of sales from El Cajón are capitalized as an offset to development costs.\nAs a result of the increased silver equivalent production, revenues increased to $20.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $15.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $5.2 million or 34%, while net income improved to $0.5 million compared to a net loss $0.2 million during the same period, a $0.7 million improvement. The improvement in net income was primarily attributable to higher net revenue from increased silver equivalent production, and lower interest and financing expense due to the Company’s new facility, partially offset by higher cost of sales, Zone 120 exploration expenses, and higher depletion and amortization as San Rafael transitioned to commercial production.\nConsolidated silver production for was approximately 397,035 ounces which represents a decrease of 24% year-over-year. Silver equivalent production was approximately 1.6 million ounces, an increase of 46% year-over-year. Consolidated cash costs significantly decreased by 128% to negative ($2.73) per silver ounce year-over-year, and all-in sustaining costs significantly decreased by 54% to $6.17 per silver ounce year-over-year.\nThe Company’s cash balance decreased from $9.3 million at year-end to $3.3 million at the end of Q1-2018 and working capital decreased from $11.8 million to $10.9 million. These decreases are mainly due to continued San Rafael capital expenditures to develop into the Main Zone, $1.8 million of exploration drilling primarily at Zone 120, a $0.5 million option payment on the San Felipe property, and $0.6 million of debt repayments on the outstanding Glencore facility. The Company’s accounts receivable balance increased by approximately $5.0 million from year-end 2017 due to the delayed timing of payment from a concentrate off-taker at quarter-end due to statutory Mexican bank holidays for Easter in the last week of March, the general increased volume of concentrate from San Rafael, and increased VAT receivables in Mexico associated with the recent San Rafael expenditures. Working capital was also impacted by increases in the current portion of the Company’s facility.\nFurther information concerning the consolidated and individual mine operations is included in the Company’s first quarter Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the same period.\nQ1 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nPresident & CEO Darren Blasutti will be hosting a Q1 2018 earnings conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 9:00am EDT.
