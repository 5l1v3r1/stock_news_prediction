(NYSE American: NAVB) (“Navidea” or the “Company”), a company focused on the development of precision immunodiagnostic agents and immunotherapeutics, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Navidea reported total revenues for the quarter of $276,000. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $6.7 million.\nMichael Goldberg, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Navidea, commented, “We were able to advance our core technology on multiple fronts and we experienced a year free from the severe financial constraints the company labored under for over a decade. Navidea had been pursuing a strategy to become a major player in the development and commercialization of precision medicine diagnostic products and took on too much debt to fund the development of in-licensed products and to develop the commercial infrastructure to market and sell its Lymphoseek product. We continue to also drive the process with the FDA and their agents to seek approval of CD206 as a qualified biomarker, thus advancing the use of Tc99m tilmanocept on a broad front for clinical trials. With our best-in-class activated macrophage targeting system, we have been able to generate significant human imaging data and promising animal data with our therapeutic agents, reinforcing our optimism that this platform holds potential for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in which macrophages play an important role.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights and Subsequent Events\nEntered an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Cardinal Health 414, LLC (“Cardinal Health 414”) in April 2018, pursuant to which Cardinal Health 414 paid the Company approximately $6.0 million and agreed to pay the Company an amount equal to the unused portion of the letter of credit (not to exceed approximately $7.1 million) promptly after the earlier of (i) the expiration of the letter of credit and (ii) the receipt by Cardinal Health 414 of evidence of the return and cancellation of the letter of credit. In exchange, the obligation of Cardinal Health 414 to make any further contingent payments has been eliminated. Cardinal Health 414 is still obligated to make the milestone payments in accordance with the terms of the earnout provisions of the Purchase Agreement. Presented strong preclinical results in Navidea’s nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) research at the 2 nd Annual NASH Summit in April Signed exclusive license with Meilleur Technologies, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cerveau Technologies, Inc. to conduct research using NAV4694, as well as an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of NAV4694 in Australia, Canada, China, and Singapore Completed two clinical imaging studies of intravenous (“IV”)-administered Tc99m tilmanocept in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis and results will be included in a package to be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding a Phase 3 clinical plan Continued enrollment in IV-administered Tc99m tilmanocept trial in NASH. Enrollment is anticipated to complete by the end of this year. Continued enrollment in 27-patient Phase 2 cardiovascular clinical study Completed a preclinical plan for Kaposi’s Sarcoma to be reviewed by the FDA Initiated a pilot study for imaging Crohn’s Disease with IV-administered Tc99m tilmanocept and evaluation of archival biopsies of Crohn’s patients for CD206 biomarker analysis Continued series of regular investor-focused Q&A conference calls to improve Investor Relations strategy\nFinancial Results\nOur consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations have been reclassified, as required by current accounting standards, for all periods presented to reflect the line of business sold to Cardinal Health 414 as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, this discussion focuses on describing results of our operations as if we had not operated the discontinued operation during the periods being disclosed.\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $276,000, compared to $580,000 in the first quarter of 2017. These revenues were primarily grant-related in both periods. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $999,000, compared to $705,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The net increase was primarily a result of increased NAV4694 development costs due to the 2017 reversal of previously accrued expenses, offset by decreased Tc99m tilmanocept, Manocept, and therapeutics development costs coupled with decreased net compensation costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $1.8 million, compared to $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The net decrease was primarily due to decreases in legal and professional services, general office expenses such as insurance, depreciation, rent and travel, and investor relations services. Navidea’s net loss attributable to common stockholders for the 2018 was $6.7 million, or $0.04 per share (basic), compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $85.6 million, or $0.53 per share, for the same period in 2017. Navidea ended the quarter with $2.2 million in cash and investments, not including the accelerated earnout payment of $6.0 million from Cardinal Health 414 which was received after the quarter ended.\nConference Call Details\nInvestors and the public are invited to access the live audio webcast through the link below.
