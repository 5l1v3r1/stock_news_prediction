So it is with a clean heart that I announce the icing of (my) Mikocheni Report,” she wrote in her blog on Thursday.\nThe number of internet users in Tanzania rose 16 percent in 2017 to 23 million, around 44 percent of the population, with most using their smartphones to go online.\nLast month, Uganda, another East African country acting to regulate internet use, announced plans to slap a new tax on social media users.
