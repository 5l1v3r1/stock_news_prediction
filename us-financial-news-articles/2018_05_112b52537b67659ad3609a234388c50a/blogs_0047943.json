And Cisco Talos warns that preventing future infections isn’t going to be easy.\n“Defending against this threat is extremely difficult due to the nature of the affected devices,” it said. “The majority of them are connected directly to the Internet, with no security devices or services between them and the potential attackers. This challenge is augmented by the fact that most of the affected devices have publicly known vulnerabilities which are not convenient for the average user to patch. Additionally, most have no built-in anti-malware capabilities. These three facts together make this threat extremely hard to counter, resulting in extremely limited opportunities to interdict malware, remove vulnerabilities, or block threats.”", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html"], "published": "2018-05-23T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:14:59.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
