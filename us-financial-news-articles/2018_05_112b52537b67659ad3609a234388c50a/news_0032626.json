(USOTC: PURA) today confirmed plans to apply for a recreational cannabis cultivation license in Canada. Last week the company announced the acquisition of Canadian Cannabis Farmers Co-Op to position Puration for the recreational marijuana market expected to be legalized nationwide in Canada this summer. The company followed up the acquisition with an online presentation on the company's overall cannabis cultivation business operation and plans for the future.\n\"Today, Puration has two separate, but related business operations,\" explained CEO Brian Shibley. \"The company produces and sells the leading CBD infused beverage in the nutritional sports supplement market under the brand name EVERx. The company also entered the cannabis cultivation market with a long-term strategy through the acquisition last year of First Choice Nursery. First Choice Nursery's sales have contributed to Puration's overall sales in the first quarter of this year, 2018, by adding to the existing sales of EVERx. We have comprehensive initiatives underway to grow both the beverage business and the cultivation business by tapping into Canada's legalization of recreational marijuana. We have a new THC infused beverage for Canada and we have acquired a business that comes with substantial experience in Canada's medical marijuana cultivation market that we believe will be invaluable to us in pursuing Canada's recreational marijuana cultivation market. Yes, Puration plans to apply for a recreational cannabis cultivation license in Canada.\"\nFor more information on Puration, visit http://www.aciconglomerated.com .\nDisclaimer/Safe Harbor:\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act.
