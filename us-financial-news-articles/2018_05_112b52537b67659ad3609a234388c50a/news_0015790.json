She currently serves as independent lead director at Jacobs Engineering Group and is a director at NCR where she chairs the compensation committee. Previously, she served as chair of the board of Hertz and a director of Ingram Micro and Western Union. Levinson has also served on multiple private tech company boards during her career as a venture investor and presently is a director of Kount, a private fintech company. She is on the advisory board of CVC Capital Partners, a member of the McKinsey New Ventures Advisory Council and a senior advisor to RRE Ventures.\nLevinson also has an extensive background as a company executive and an investor, having served as a partner at GRP Partners (now UpFront Partners), an executive at Creative Artists Agency, a partner of merchant bank Wings Partner, and a senior vice president of American Express Travel Related Services Co. She became the first female partner of McKinsey & Company in 1978.\n“I am excited to use the experience I have gathered throughout my career and apply it to Clearpath and the autonomous vehicle industry,” said Levinson. “I admire the foundation that has been laid and am confident that together we are going to build a truly remarkable, global business. I look forward to joining the other board members and the Clearpath executive team in pushing this company to the top of the industry.”\nLevinson officially joined the Clearpath board in October 2017. Her addition continues the recent trend of Clearpath strengthening its world-class support team.
