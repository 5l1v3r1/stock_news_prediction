REUTERS/Neil Hall\nOverall shop prices fell by 1.1 percent in year-on-year terms, making May the 61st month of prices declining, data from the British Retail Consortium (BSC) showed.\nThe BRC’s survey highlighted a widening gap between rising prices for food and falling prices for other goods.\nPrices of non-food items fell by the most since August 2016, down 2.5 percent in year-on-year terms in May, while food inflation picked up to 1.2 percent from 1.0 percent in April.\n“While food inflation has increased this month as the weather, oil price and other geo-political factors have influenced global agricultural markets, we expect overall prices to fall in the coming months,” BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.\nLast week, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said inflation would probably rise slightly in the coming months before resuming a decline.

But business and professional services enjoyed the fastest growth since August 2015.\n“For all services, rising costs are exerting pressure on margins, but in business and professional services, sales volumes are helping profitability to kick in,” CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
