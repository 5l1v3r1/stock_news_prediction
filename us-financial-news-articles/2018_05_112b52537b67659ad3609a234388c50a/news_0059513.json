Proceeds from the sale of GTX provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in organic growth and M&A opportunities, while providing increased liquidity to accelerate return on capital, which may include increasing the scale of our stock repurchase program and reducing our debt. We are pleased to be able to partner on this transaction with Deutsche Börse Group's FX unit, 360T, a leading global FX venue,\" Mr. Stevens added.\nThe transaction is expected to result in proceeds of approximately $85 million for GAIN, net of taxes and transaction-related expenses and fees and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nGAIN initially launched GTX in 2010 as a venue for trading in FX and precious metals by institutional investors.
