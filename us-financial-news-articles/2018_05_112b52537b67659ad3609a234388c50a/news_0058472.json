In a clinical study conducted in Sweden, the SHACT treatment was associated with significant reduction of pain and discomfort in women undergoing gynecological interventions without causing bothersome side effects. In the 218-patient study, women treated with SHACT experienced significantly less pain during intrauterine device (IUD) placement compared to those treated with placebo (p<0.0001). In Canada, over 220 000 IUDs were inserted in the twelve months ending June 2017. 1 The market for IUD’s has been steadily increasing with double-digit annual growth as more women opt for that method of contraception.\n“This is an excellent partnership for Acerus as SHACT is well-aligned with our strategy of becoming the Canadian leader in women’s health by providing innovative products addressing unmet medical needs. Acerus currently intends to file a new drug submission with Health Canada in the first half of 2019, and, if approved, expects SHACT to be commercialized in the first half of 2020”, said Tricia Symmes, Chief Operating Officer of Acerus.\n“This transaction will help broaden our women’s health product portfolio and will leverage our existing salesforce. With SHACT, Acerus continues to build a unique product offering that will help accelerate and diversify our product revenues,” added Ed Gudaitis President and Chief Executive Officer of Acerus.\nHelena Jansson, CEO of Pharmanest, noted: “We are extremely pleased to be partnering with Acerus Pharmaceuticals, an emerging Canadian leader in women’s health. We believe they have all the expertise and infrastructure required to make SHACT a commercial success in Canada.”\nUnder the terms of the license agreement, Pharmanest will receive an upfront and regulatory milestone payments upon Acerus receiving marketing approval in Canada. Pharmanest will also receive milestone payments based on Acerus achieving sales targets. Pharmanest will oversee the manufacturing of SHACT and will receive a tiered supply price for the product comprised of a percentage on net sales of the product.\nAbout SHACT\nSHACT is a novel delivery technology that provides pain relief on mucosal tissue.
