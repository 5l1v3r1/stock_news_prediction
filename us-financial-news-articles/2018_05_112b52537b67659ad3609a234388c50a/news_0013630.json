They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors,\" Musk tweeted. ( bit.ly/2jrfYDr )\n“(the questions) were neither valid nor pertinent,” he said.\nIn the call, Musk devoted 23 minutes in taking questions from a 25-year-old Tesla investor, Galileo Russell, who owns an YouTube investment channel called HyperChange TV.\n“HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them,” Musk wrote in another tweet.
