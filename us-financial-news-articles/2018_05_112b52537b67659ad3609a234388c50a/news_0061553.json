The economy grew an annual 2.4 percent in 2017, below the trend rate of 2.75 percent.\nAnalysts at Swiss investment bank UBS downgraded their house price forecast on Wednesday, expecting values to drop by 5 percent or more over the next year from their long-held view of flat to a 3 percent fall.\nThe dour outlook means the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will likely keep rates at a record low of 1.50 percent for a long time to come.\n“We continue to expect the RBA will hold until at least the second half of next year, but given the downside risks to our housing and consumer outlook, the RBA could remain on hold for even longer,” George Tharenou at UBS said in a note.\n“Separately, the surprisingly weaker trend in non-residential building approvals is important to highlight, as if it is sustained it could suggest momentum for business investment is rolling over.”\nApprovals for commercial properties such as offices slipped for a second straight month in April to be down 4 percent. On an annual basis, it slumped nearly 20 percent.\nNon-residential building approvals have stumbled in nine of the past 12 months.\n“The recent downturn in approvals is challenging our outlook for ongoing strength in non-residential activity into 2019,” ANZ economists said.
