Immuno-oncology represents a fast growing part of the oncology drug pipeline.

We believe we are well positioned to support these efforts, especially with the appointment of Dr. Wesa. In this new role for the organization, Dr. Wesa will lead immune-oncology research and development, working across the organization to expand Champion's immune-oncology portfolio of services and research efforts.\"\nDr. Wesa brings more than 15 years of experience in translational immuno-oncology, with expertise in the development of cell and gene therapy, including CAR T cells, as well as other therapeutics for solid and hematologic malignancies.

The Company's TumorGraft technology platform is a novel approach to personalizing cancer care based upon the implantation of primary human tumors in immune deficient mice followed by propagation of the resulting engraftments, or TumorGrafts, in a manner that preserves the biological characteristics of the original human tumor in order to determine the efficacy of a treatment regimen. The Company uses this technology in conjunction with related services to offer solutions for two customer groups: Personalized Oncology Solutions, in which results help guide the development of personalized treatment plans, and Translational Oncology Solutions, in which pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking personalized approaches to drug development can lower the cost and increase the speed of developing new drugs. TumorGrafts are procured through agreements with a number of institutions in the U.S. and overseas as well as through Champions' Personalized Oncology Solutions business.
