(NASDAQ:TNAV), a leading provider of connected car and location-based platform services, today released its the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 by issuing this press release and posting a letter to stockholders on the quarter on its website. Please visit Telenav’s investor relations website at http://investor.telenav.com to view the Q3 fiscal year 2018 financial results and letter to stockholders.\n“We are pleased to deliver a record number of Telenav enabled cars to the market during the quarter,” said HP Jin, Chairman and CEO of Telenav. “There are now more than 8 million connected cars on the road powered by Telenav’s location-based services platform.”\nFinancial Highlights for the third quarter ended March 31, 2018\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $13.8 million, compared with $35.1 million in the same prior year period. As previously announced, the decline was primarily due to the change in revenue recognition as a result of the Company’s commencement of offering multi-year value-added map services in all major markets to Ford®, its largest customer, effective January 1, 2018, which results in significant deferral of amounts that would have previously been recognized as revenue when the vehicle is produced. When Telenav adopts ASC 606 as of July 1, 2018, it expects it will be able to recognize substantial revenue from Ford as our product is delivered. Billings for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $58.7 million, compared with $60.2 million in the same prior year period. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(30.8) million, compared with a GAAP net loss of $(13.7) million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with the decrease due primarily to the change in revenue recognition criteria for the Ford agreement. Adjusted EBITDA on billings for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was a $(4.1) million loss compared with a $(2.3) million loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Ending cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, were $88.6 million as of March 31, 2018. This represented cash and short-term investments of $1.98 per share, based on 44.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2018. Telenav had no debt as of March 31, 2018.\nRecent Business Highlights\nA record 1.4 million Telenav equipped cars were deployed into the market during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of which 1.2 million units were capable of connected services Ford entered into an agreement to extend Telenav’s offering for SYNC 3 for calendar years 2019 and 2020 for all current geographies Ford launched Telenav’s connected services across select model year 2018 SYNC 3 vehicles in Europe and China using its FordPass mobile phone application Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) launched Telenav’s embedded navigation solution on Jeep’s 2018 Grand Cherokee, Grand Commander, Wrangler and Grand Voyager models in China Thinknear® by Telenav launched Geolink TM , a self-serve mobile advertising platform that utilizes Thinknear’s proven location-targeting and campaign-optimization technology at scale\nQ4 Fiscal 2018 Business Outlook\nFor the quarter ending June 30, 2018, Telenav offers the following guidance:\nTotal revenue is expected to be $15 to $16 million Billings are expected to be $55 to $58 million Deferred revenue is expected to increase by $40 to $42 million Deferred costs are expected to increase by approximately $19 to $20 million GAAP gross profit is expected to be approximately $6 million GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 40 percent Direct contribution from billings is expected to be approximately $27 to $28 million Direct contribution margin from billings is expected to be approximately 48 percent GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $34 to $35 million GAAP net loss is expected to be $(29) to $(31) million Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be $(25) to $(27) million Adjusted EBITDA loss on billings is expected to be $(3.5) to $(5.5) million Automotive is expected to be 40 to 45 percent of total revenue and 85 percent of billings Advertising is expected to be approximately 40 percent of total revenue and 11 percent of billings Weighted average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 45.0 million\nSubject to anticipated volumes, take rates and timing of model expansion under Telenav’s various automotive OEM programs, including the potential impact, if any, from Ford’s recent announcement of its intention to modify its North American passenger car portfolio, Telenav anticipates that adjusted EBITDA on billings will be positive for fiscal 2019.\nThe above information concerning guidance represents Telenav's outlook only as of the date hereof, and is subject to change, as a result of amendments to material contracts and other changes in business conditions. Telenav undertakes no obligation to update or revise any financial forecast or other forward-looking statements, as a result of new developments, or otherwise.\nConference Call and Quarterly Commentary\nTelenav will host an investor conference call and live webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Time (5:30 p.m. Eastern Time).

The non-GAAP financial measures such as billings, direct contribution from billings, direct contribution margin from billings, change in deferred revenue, change in deferred costs, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA on billings and free cash flow included in this press release are different from those otherwise presented under GAAP. Telenav has provided these measures in addition to GAAP financial results because management believes these non-GAAP measures help provide a consistent basis for comparison between periods that are not influenced by certain items and therefore, are helpful in understanding Telenav’s underlying operating results. These non-GAAP measures are some of the primary measures Telenav’s management uses for planning and forecasting. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to information provided by other companies.\nBillings measure GAAP revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period. Direct contribution from billings reflects GAAP gross profit plus change in deferred revenue less change in deferred costs. Direct contribution margin from billings reflects direct contribution from billings divided by billings. Telenav has also provided a breakdown of the calculation of the change in deferred revenue by segment, which is added to revenue in calculating its non-GAAP metric of billings. In connection with its presentation of the change in deferred revenue, Telenav has provided a similar presentation of the change in the related deferred costs. Such deferred costs primarily include costs associated with third party content and certain development costs associated with our customized software solutions. As deferred revenue and deferred costs become larger components of its operating results, Telenav believes these metrics are useful in evaluating cash flows.\nTelenav considers billings, direct contribution from billings and direct contribution margin from billings to be useful metrics for management and investors because billings drive revenue and deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of its business. Telenav believes direct contribution from billings and direct contribution margin from billings are useful metrics because they reflect the impact of the contribution over time for such billings, exclusive of the incremental costs incurred to deliver any related service obligations. There are a number of limitations related to the use of billings, direct contribution from billings and direct contribution margin from billings versus revenue, gross profit, and gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, billings, direct contribution from billings and direct contribution margin from billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue or cost and may require additional services or costs to be provided over contracted service periods. For example, billings related to certain connected solutions cannot be fully recognized as revenue in a given period due to requirements for ongoing provisioning of services such as hosting, monitoring and customer support, including certain third-party technology and content license fees as applicable. Accordingly, direct contribution from billings and direct contribution margin from billings do not include all costs associated with billings. Second, Telenav may calculate billings, direct contribution from billings, and direct contribution margin from billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures, making comparisons between companies more difficult. When Telenav uses these measures, it attempts to compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding billings, direct contribution from billings and direct contribution margin from billings and how they relate to revenue, gross profit and gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA measures GAAP net loss excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), provision (benefit) for income taxes, and other applicable items such as legal settlements and contingencies, deferred rent reversal and tenant improvement allowance recognition due to sublease termination, net of tax and goodwill impairment. Stock-based compensation expense relates to equity incentive awards granted to its employees, directors, and consultants. Legal settlements and contingencies represent settlements and offers made to settle litigation in which Telenav is a defendant and royalty disputes. Deferred rent reversal and tenant improvement allowance recognition represent the reversal of Telenav’s deferred rent liability and recognition of Telenav’s deferred tenant improvement allowance, as amortization of these amounts is no longer required due to the termination of our Santa Clara facility sublease and subsequent entry into a new lease agreement with our landlord for this same facility effective September 2017. Goodwill impairment represents the impairment charge related to Telenav’s Mobile Navigation segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on billings are key measures used by Telenav’s management and board of directors to understand and evaluate Telenav’s core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, Telenav believes that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Telenav’s core business. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of Telenav’s board of directors in connection with the development of incentive-based compensation for Telenav’s executive officers. Accordingly, Telenav believes that adjusted EBITDA generally provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Telenav’s operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA on billings measures adjusted EBITDA plus the effect of changes in deferred revenue and deferred costs. Telenav believes adjusted EBITDA on billings is a useful measure, especially in light of the impact it continues to expect on reported GAAP revenue for certain value-added offerings the company provides its customers, including Ford map updates. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on billings, while generally measures of profitability, can also represent losses.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure Telenav defines as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. Telenav considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash (used in) generated by its business after purchases of property and equipment.\nTo reconcile the historical GAAP results to non-GAAP financial metrics, please refer to the reconciliations in the financial statements included in this earnings release.\nIn this press release, Telenav has provided guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis, for billings, change in deferred revenue, change in deferred costs, direct contribution from billings, direct contribution margin from billings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on billings. Telenav does not provide reconciliations of its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of billings, change in deferred revenue, change in deferred costs, direct contribution from billings, direct contribution margin from billings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on billings to the corresponding GAAP measures due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with respect to deferred revenue, deferred costs, stock-based compensation and tax provision (benefit), which are components of these non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, stock-based compensation is impacted by future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of Telenav’s common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and subject to constant change. The actual amounts of these items will have a significant impact on Telenav’s GAAP net loss per diluted share and GAAP tax provision (benefit). Accordingly, reconciliations of Telenav’s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on Telenav management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to its management. Actual events or results may differ materially from those described in this document due to a number of risks and uncertainties. These potential risks and uncertainties include, among others: Telenav's ability to develop and implement products for Ford, GM and Toyota and to support Ford, GM and Toyota and their customers; the impact of Ford’s recent announcement regarding the elimination of various sedans in North America over the near term; Telenav's success in extending its contracts for current and new generation of products with its existing OEMs and automotive manufacturers, particularly Ford; Telenav’s ability to achieve additional design wins and the delivery dates of automobiles including Telenav's products; adoption by vehicle purchasers of Scout GPS Link; Telenav's dependence on a limited number of automotive manufacturers and OEMs for a substantial portion of its revenue; reductions in demand for automobiles; potential impacts of OEMs including competitive capabilities in their vehicles such as Apple Car-Play and Android Auto; Telenav's ability to grow and scale its advertising business; Telenav’s ability to develop new advertising products and technology while also achieving cash flow break even and ultimately profitability in the advertising business; Telenav incurring losses and operating expenses in excess of expectations; failure to reach agreement with customers for awards and contracts on products and services in which Telenav has expended resources developing; competition from other market participants who may provide comparable services to subscribers without charge; the timing of new product releases and vehicle production by Telenav's automotive customers, including inventory procurement and fulfillment; possible warranty claims, and the impact on consumer perception of its brand; Telenav's ability to develop and support products including OpenStreetMap (“OSM”), as well as transition existing navigation products to OSM and any economic benefit anticipated from the use of OSM versus proprietary map products; the potential that Telenav may not be able to realize its deferred tax assets and may have to take a reserve against them; Telenav’s reliance on its automotive manufacturers for volume and royalty reporting; the impact on revenue recognition and other financial reporting due to the amendment of contracts or changes in accounting standards, such as the implementation of ASC 606; and macroeconomic and political conditions in the U.S. and abroad, in particular China. Telenav discusses these risks in greater detail in \"Risk factors\" and elsewhere in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which are available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, forward-looking statements represent management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date made. You should review our SEC filings carefully and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what Telenav expects.\nABOUT TELENAV, INC.\nTelenav is a leading provider of connected car and location-based platform services, focused on transforming life on the go for people - before, during, and after every drive.
