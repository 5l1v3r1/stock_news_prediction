It had weakened earlier in the day, prompting the central bank to sell$139.5 million in reserves into the spot market.\nThrough Wednesday the local currency had weakened 9.12 percent in May and 17.5 percent since the start of 2018, prompting the central bank to sell billions of dollars in foreign currency reserves and hike interest rates to 40 percent.\n“The recent government measures to contain capital outflows should allow markets to find some stability,” J.P. Morgan said in a note on Thursday, though it said it had reduced the size of its overweight position in the peso due to the recent volatility.\nTreasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne met with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde in Washington in the afternoon. In a statement after the meeting, Lagarde said the IMF supported Argentina’s reforms and that she had instructed her team to “continue discussions toward a Fund-supported program.”\nFinance Minister Luis Caputo said the deal would guarantee financing through the end of President Mauricio Macri’s first term in December 2019 at a “very good” interest rate of around 4 percent.\nBonds have rallied on the IMF talks, with the country’s over-the-counter bonds rising 1.5 percent on average on Thursday. Dollar-denominated debt led the surge.\nStocks continued the rebound that began on Wednesday after Congress passed a reform to the country’s capital markets law. The benchmark Merval index closed up 6.32 percent on Thursday, led by energy companies.\nDespite the calm markets, traders and analysts said the tightening of monetary and fiscal policy and conditions the IMF was likely to propose for the loans posed risks to Argentina’s economy. Capital Economics warned the measures would lead to a recession this year, forecasting a 0.5 percent contraction.
