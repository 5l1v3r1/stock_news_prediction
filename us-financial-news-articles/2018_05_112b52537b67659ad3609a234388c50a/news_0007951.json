We continue our strong trajectory with another quarter of robust organic revenue growth. Equally important is our commitment to invest for the future and our steadfast focus on delivering innovative and differentiated solutions to meet our customers' mission-critical requirements,” said ManTech President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin M. Phillips.\nSummary Operating Results Three months ended\nMarch 31, (In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2018 2017 Revenue $473.2 $418.4 Operating Income $26.4 $24.4 Operating Margin 5.6 % 5.8 % Depreciation and Amortization $13.2 $7.7 Depreciation and Amortization % of Revenue 2.8 % 1.8 % Net Income $20.1 $15.0 Diluted Earnings Per Share $0.51 $0.39\nAs a result of increased demand for our services and solutions, revenues for the quarter were $473.2 million, up 13% from $418.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue growth was driven by a combination of organic expansion from recent contract awards and acquisitions.\nOperating income for the quarter was $26.4 million, up 8% compared to the first quarter of 2017, representing an operating margin of 5.6%. For the quarter, net income was $20.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.51, up 34% and 31%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nCash Management and Capital Deployment Three months ended\nMarch 31, (Dollars In Millions)\n2018 2017 Net Income $20.1 $15.0 Cash Flow from Operations $(18.0) $36.5 Operating Cash Flow Multiple of Net Income (0.9)x 2.4x Capital Expenditures $8.7 $3.4 Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) 69 68 Cash and Cash Equivalents, End of Period $10.4 $91.6 Current and Long Term Debt, End of Period $65.5 $0.0\nThe company used $18.0 million of net cash flow to fund operating activities in the quarter.

As of March 31, 2018, the company had $10.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $65.5 million of outstanding borrowings on its $500 million revolving-credit facility, which leaves the company with ample financial capacity to support growth, pursue acquisitions and issue dividends while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nThe company paid $9.9 million in dividends, or $0.25 per share, to its common stockholders of record as of March 9, 2018. The Board of Directors has declared that the company will pay a cash dividend of $0.25 per share on June 22, 2018, to all common stockholders of record as of June 8, 2018, as part of its regular quarterly cash dividend program. Future declarations of dividends and their record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of ManTech's Board of Directors.\nContract Awards\nContract awards (bookings) totaled $430 million in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. Over the trailing 12 months, the book-to-bill ratio is 2.2. ManTech won several large, single-award contracts in the quarter including:\nC4I Integration in U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Combat Vehicles. ManTech was awarded a 5-year contract totaling $82 million by the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR SSC) to augment Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) capabilities of USMC combat vehicles.\nAdditional contract awards in the quarter include several extensions to existing contracts and new contracts from various customers, most of which are classified.\nIn addition, the company won several multiple-award indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, which are not included in bookings, including:\nDefense Information Systems Agency (DISA) ENCORE III. Under this 10-year, $17.5 billion contract ManTech will have the opportunity to win task orders to provide a range of IT solutions.\nThe company’s backlog of business at the end of quarter was $7.1 billion and funded backlog was $1.2 billion.\nForward Guidance\nBased on our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising and narrowing our 2018 guidance range on revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share as specified in the table below.\nMeasure Fiscal 2018 Guidance Revenue (billion) $1.90 - $1.95 Net Income (million) $80.1 - $83.3 Diluted Earnings per Share $2.00 - $2.08\nManTech Chief Financial Officer Judith L.
