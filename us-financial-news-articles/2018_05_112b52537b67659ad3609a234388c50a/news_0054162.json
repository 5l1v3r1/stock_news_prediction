But in recent months it has crept higher within that range, currently set at 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent, on some days hitting even 1.70 percent.\nTo view a graphic on Fed funds effective rate vs interest on excess reserves, click: reut.rs/2KWr6Ej\nSo in an attempt to nudge the fed funds rate back toward the middle, the Fed has sketched out a plan to set its effective upper bound, a rate paid on banks’ excess reserves and known as IOER, at 1.95 percent instead of 2.00 percent when it next decides to tighten policy.\n“This is about protecting and maintaining full control of its single most important interest rate,” Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, wrote in a client note. He added the Fed could continue to effectively narrow the policy range if the trend continues.\nThe Fed is reacting to a steady decline in banks’ excess reserves from about $2.7 trillion in 2014, when it set up the current policy framework, to less than $2 trillion now.\nTo view a graphic on U.S. banks' excess reserves at the Fed, click: reut.rs/2KTDOU9\nAs a multiple of required bank reserves, such excess reserves are near their lowest levels since the 2007-2009 crisis.\nThe Fed has contributed to the drop by shedding some of its own bond holdings since September. Putting further upward pressure on the fed funds rate within that range, new government spending caused a spike this year in U.S. Treasuries issuance that in turn has raised costs in the overnight repo market.\nTo view a graphic on Excess reserves vs the Fed's balance sheet, click: reut.rs/2KWcnsN\nSince the Fed plans to keep trimming its portfolio, and fiscal stimulus will run well into next year, central bankers are already considering more wholesale adjustments to the way they control borrowing costs in the economy.\nAccording to minutes of the May 1-2 meeting, a number of Fed officials suggested that, “before too long, the Committee might want to further discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen in recent years.”\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://reut.rs/2KWr6Ej", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://reut.rs/2KTDOU9", "https://reut.rs/2KWcnsN"], "published": "2018-05-26T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T22:48:08.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
