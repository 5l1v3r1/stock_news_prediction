Photo: PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES/BETTMANN ARCHIVE\nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\nKissinger on how The Enlightenment ends. At 94, the former national security advisor and secretary of state is almost old enough to remember when the first printing press hit the streets, paving the way for what we now call the Age of Enlightenment. “Individual insight and scientific knowledge replaced faith as the principal criterion of human consciousness,” Henry Kissinger writes in the Atlantic . Centuries later, humanity finds itself slipping into Age of Faith 2.0, this one defined by algorithms and data. “These algorithms, being mathematical interpretations of observed data, do not explain the underlying reality that produces them. Paradoxically, as the world becomes more transparent, it will also become increasingly mysterious,” he writes. Human cognition is set to lose its “personal character.”\nCybersecurity requires a step back . One way or another, it will happen. Air gaps will be bridged, firewalls breached and the cybersecurity staff worken by that 2 a.m. call. For the sake of security (and sleep), should companies drop the digital transformation schtick and go analog? Well, yes, kind of, suggests Andy Bochman, senior grid strategist at Idaho National Laboratory. Mr. Bochman recommends that companies move away from a “full reliance on digital complexity and connectivity.” An effort to identify “essential processes” and cut or even eliminate the digital pathways hackers could use to reach them, makes a company safer and senior leaders better able to weigh strategic cyber risks, he writes in Harvard Business Review ,\nWhen analytics efforts fail. Scaling analytics pilot programs remains out of reach for a surprising number of companies. In a recent McKinsey & Co. survey, just eight percent out of 1,000 respondents with analytics initiatives said they found success. Blame the boss, many of whom cannot differentiate between “traditional analytics,” such as business intelligence, and the “advanced analytics” made possible by tools such as machine learning. To fix the problem, McKinsey recommends that the CEO, CAO or CDO start educating the peers on analytics analytics. “These workshops can form the foundation of in-house “academies” that can continually teach key analytics concepts to a broader management audience.”\nShare this: Previous Improving the Odds of Success for Corporate Transformations", "external_links": ["https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/ten-red-flags-signaling-your-analytics-program-will-fail", "https://hbr.org/cover-story/2018/05/internet-insecurity", "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-mean-the-end-of-human-history/559124/"], "published": "2018-05-18T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T21:51:52.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
