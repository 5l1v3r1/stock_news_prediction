EBITDA represents net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus stock-based compensation and non-recurring IPO expenses.

These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. We find this especially useful when reviewing pro forma results of operations, which include large non-cash amortizations of intangible assets from acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Boxlight Corporation\nBoxlight Corporation (Nasdaq: BOXL) (“Boxlight”) is a leading provider of technology solutions for the global education market.
