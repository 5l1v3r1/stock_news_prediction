The nearest bridge over the river is 20 km (12 miles) away from the mountainside village.\nThe villagers have applied their own ingenuity in building the ziplines, inclined downhill and relying mostly on gravity, to cross the Nu, which snakes from Tibet along China’s border with Myanmar through the southwestern province of Yunnan.

REUTERS/Aly Song\nPeople estimate about 20 to 30 hamlets in the region still rely on the ziplines as their primary means across the river, although the lines are not always reliable, since they become slippery when it rains and too dangerous to use.\nSeveral zipline villages remaining in Fugong county, an eight-hour drive from Lazimi, are swiftly being connected to the outside world with bridges built by road construction projects.\n“Right now, conditions are a bit better and they’re building bridges, so these ziplines are being torn down,” said Yun Zeqing, an engineer who has maintained the zipline in one of the Fungong villages for decades.
