However, Oskar Gabrielson, general manager at Battlefield developer EA DICE, responded by saying that female characters would not be going anywhere.\n“First, let me be clear about one thing. Player choice and female playable characters are here to stay. We want Battlefield V to represent all those who were a part of the greatest drama in human history, and give players choice to choose and customize the characters they play with,” Gabrielson said over a series of tweets.

We always set out to push boundaries and deliver unexpected experiences. But above all, our games must be fun!\n— Oskar Gabrielson (@ogabrielson) May 25, 2018 The Battlefield sandbox has always been about playing the way you want. Like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers. With BFV you also get the chance to play as who you want.
