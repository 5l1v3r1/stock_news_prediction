One attacker was wounded and detained while the other one fled, the report said.\nSabq reported additional injuries among the security forces without providing details.\nThe Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTaif is perched in the mountains just east of Mecca, the holiest site in Islam.\nReporting by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
