The additions add depth on the financial side while further strengthening the company’s experience in the cannabis industry.\nChris Seto has been named Chief Financial Officer. Seto comes to the company with a strong background in mergers and acquisitions, investment banking and financial management. He was previously Partner and Head of M&A at Paradigm Capital and earned his investment banking experience at UBS and CIBC World Markets. Seto also served on the senior management team at Warren Shepell Consultants.\n“Chris’ background is the perfect mix for us. He knows how to grow a company quickly and has years of experience working on some of the biggest transactions in the Canadian market,” said GrowForce Chairman & CEO Rishi Gautam. “His M&A knowledge will be extremely beneficial as we expect the Canadian cannabis market will see a great deal of consolidation in the years ahead. We intend to be at the forefront of that trend.”\nJames Lowe joins GrowForce as Executive Vice President of Operations. A co-founder of MJardin Group in the United States and an early-stage entrepreneur in the legal cannabis space since 2009, Lowe has overseen the production and sale of more legal cannabis in his career than has been grown legally in all of Canada to date. He owns both recreational and medical licenses in every category of the industry including cultivation, extraction, and retail. He has produced cannabis indoors, outdoors, and in greenhouses ranging from 3,000-sq.-ft to multi-acre facilities. Before founding MJardin, Lowe was CEO for Cloud 9 Support, an independent cultivation management and supply company that led both regulatory permitting and cultivation for dozens of facilities during the first years of Colorado’s legalization.\nPat Witcher will serve as GrowForce’s Vice President of Strategic Partnerships. A former law enforcement officer with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Kansas City Police Department, Witcher was most recently the President of Buddy Boy Brands, one of the largest cannabis retail operations in Colorado. After that, he served as Chief Compliance Officer with MJardin before taking on his new role to lead the regulatory compliance, government relations and strategic partnerships for GrowForce.\n“I’m extremely excited by the executive team we’re building at GrowForce,” said Gautam. “Where many of our competitors are just learning the cannabis industry, our team has already spent years producing and selling large quantities of high quality, legal product in some of the most competitive markets in North America.”\nGautam also announced the company has engaged Spinnaker Capital Markets to provide investor relations counsel. Spinnaker works with small and mid-cap publicly-listed companies, providing an array of services tailored to raise capital, attract retail and institutional investors and increase shareholder value.\nAbout GrowForce\nGrowForce is a Canadian-based cannabis platform that operates within Health Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations.
