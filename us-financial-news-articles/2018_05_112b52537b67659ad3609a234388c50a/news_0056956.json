Stoneman was clean bowled in both innings at Lord’s, scoring four and nine.\nThe 25-year-old Jennings has played six tests for England, the last of them in August 2017 against South Africa.\n“Keaton Jennings showed a strong temperament in scoring a hundred on his test match debut against India in December 2016,” national selector Ed Smith said in a statement on Monday.\n“Keaton has found good form in county cricket this season, including three centuries in his last seven innings (two in the First Division of the County Championship, one in the Royal London One-Day Cup).
