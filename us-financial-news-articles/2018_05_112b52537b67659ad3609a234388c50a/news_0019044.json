The stock has lost about 16 percent, or A$22.7 billion in market value, since Aug. 3 when authorities accused it of breaching anti-money laundering rules.\nHugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management which owns bank shares, said the decline in underlying profit looked bad compared with the “very good result” from smaller rival Westpac on Monday.\nUnaudited cash earnings for the three months to March 31 fell 2 percent to A$2.35 billion ($1.8 billion) from a year ago, Sydney-based CBA said in a limited trading update.\nOperating expenses grew 3 percent over the quarter, driven by higher provisions for regulatory and compliance projects.\nThe increase in expenses comes on top of the A$575 million provision for fines and regulatory, compliance and remediation programmes the bank recognised in the previous half.\nAustralia’s banking regulator slugged CBA with an extra A$1 billion capital requirement last week, to be lifted once governance reforms have taken place to address concerns raised by the anti-money laundering breaches.\nNet interest margin “declined slightly”, the bank said. Troublesome and impaired assets for the quarter fell to A$6.6 billion, from A$6.7 billion a year earlier, but rose 10 percent over the previous quarter.\nAustralia’s major banks began hiking mortgage rates last year in response to an imposed cap on interest-only loans amid concerns about soaring property prices.\nThe hike caused customers to move to cheaper principal and interest home loans, CBA said.\nCredit card fees were lower and its treasury and trading units also reported a weaker “performance”, the bank said. $1 = 1.3419 Australian dollars Reporting by Paulina Duran in Sydney.
