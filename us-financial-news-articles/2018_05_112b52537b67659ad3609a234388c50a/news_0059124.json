The exchange is currently testing out copper options via simulated trading.\nThe chairman said ShFE would explore opportunities to set up warehouses in the Hainan free-trade zone, which China is aiming to establish by 2020, and overseas, without specifying for which commodities.\nReporting by Tom Daly; additional reporting by Aizhu Chen; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:07:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
