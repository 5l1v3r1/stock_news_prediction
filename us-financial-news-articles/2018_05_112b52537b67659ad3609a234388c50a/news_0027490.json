Green Dot also reported adjusted EBITDA 1 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share 1 of $104.1 million and $1.40, respectively.\nSaid Green Dot Founder and CEO, Steve Streit, “Green Dot’s unique “Products and Platform” model and the disciplined execution of our “2018 Six Step Plan” continues to yield very impressive results, delivering yet another consecutive quarter where we’ve exceeded our top and bottom line financial expectations and set new records for nearly all key operating metrics in both reporting segments. The ongoing financial momentum we are seeing in both Green Dot’s own established product lines and those new products being powered by Green Dot’s “Banking-as-a-Service,” or BaaS, Platform provides us the ability to raise both top and bottom line full year financial guidance.\"\nGAAP financial results for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nTotal operating revenues on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis were $315.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, up from $253.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, representing a year-over-year increase of 25%. GAAP net income was $70.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, up from $40.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, representing a year-over-year increase of 72%. GAAP diluted earnings per common share was $1.29 for the first quarter of 2018, up from $0.78 for the first quarter of 2017, representing a year-over-year increase of 65%.\nNon-GAAP financial results for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017: 1\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $104.1 million, or 33.1% of total operating revenues for the first quarter of 2018, up from $89.6 million, or 35.4% of total operating revenues for the first quarter of 2017, representing a year-over-year increase of 16%. Non-GAAP net income 1 was $75.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, up from $52.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, representing a year-over-year increase of 45%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 1 was $1.40 for the first quarter of 2018, up from $1.00 for the first quarter of 2017, representing a year-over-year increase of 40%.\nThe Company's key business metrics described in the latest Annual Report on Form 10-K have been revised to include additional product lines or services that have grown to become sufficiently material to warrant inclusion. Previously reported metrics have been restated for comparability.\nThe Company believes the following measures are the primary indicators of quarterly and annual revenues and expenses:\nGross Dollar Volume - represents the total dollar volume of funds loaded to the Company’s account products. The Company uses this metric to analyze the total amount of money moving onto its account programs, determine the overall engagement and usage patterns of its account holder base and serves as a leading indicator of revenue generated through its Account Services segment products, inclusive of interest income generated on deposits held at Green Dot Bank, fees charged to account holders and interchange revenues generated through the spending of account balances.\nNumber of Active Accounts - represents any bank account within our Account Services segment that is subject to United States Patriot Act compliance and, therefore, requires customer identity verification prior to use and is intended to accept ongoing customer cash or ACH deposits. This includes general purpose reloadable prepaid card accounts, demand deposit or \"checking\" accounts, and credit card accounts in the Company’s portfolio that had a purchase, deposit or ATM withdrawal transaction during the applicable quarter. The Company uses this metric to analyze the overall size of its active customer base and to analyze multiple metrics expressed as an average across this active account base.\nPurchase Volume - represents the total dollar volume of purchase transactions made by the Company’s account holders. This metric excludes the dollar volume of ATM withdrawals. The Company uses this metric to analyze interchange revenue, which is a key component of its financial performance.\nNumber of Cash Transfers - represents the total number of cash transfer transactions conducted by consumers, such as a point-of-sale swipe reload transaction, the purchase of a MoneyPak or an e-cash mobile remittance transaction marketed under various brand names, that the Company conducted through its retail distributors in a specified period. This metric excludes disbursements made through the Company’s Simply Paid wage disbursement platform. The Company reviews this metric as a measure of the size and scale of its retail cash processing network, as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of its products and services, and to analyze cash transfer revenue, which is a key component of the Company’s financial performance.\nNumber of Tax Refunds Processed - represents the total number of tax refunds processed in a specified period. The Company reviews this metric as a measure of the size and scale of its tax refund processing platform and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of its products and services.\nThe following table shows the Company's quarterly key business metrics for each of the last five calendar quarters under these revised definitions.\n2018 2017 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 (In millions) Gross dollar volume $ 11,719 $ 8,425 $ 7,683 $ 7,511 $ 7,485 Number of active accounts at quarter end 6.01 5.30 5.27 5.15 5.05 Purchase volume $ 7,470 $ 5,661 $ 5,235 $ 5,233 $ 5,505 Number of cash transfers 10.10 9.95 9.80 9.55 9.30 Number of tax refunds processed 8.75 0.06 0.10 2.41 8.60 For comparative purposes, the following table shows the Company's quarterly key business metrics for each of the last five calendar quarters under the prior year definitions described in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2018 2017 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 (In millions) Gross dollar volume $ 11,654 $ 8,556 $ 7,856 $ 7,687 $ 7,707 Number of active cards at quarter end 5.96 5.26 5.23 5.15 5.05 Purchase volume $ 7,440 $ 5,645 $ 5,206 $ 5,226 $ 5,503 Number of cash transfers 10.10 9.95 9.80 9.55 9.30 Number of tax refunds processed 8.75 0.06 0.10 2.41 8.60 Said Mark Shifke, Green Dot’s Chief Financial Officer, “Our upwardly revised full year top and bottom line guidance is a reflection of the strong financial results we achieved in Q1, further supported by the continuing strong business momentum in our six revenue divisions and our bank. Additionally, the material ongoing margin expansion from our existing product lines is expected to drive consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 360 basis points in the second half of the 2018 as compared with the second half of 2017, which is expected to result in consolidated margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points at the midpoint of our revised 2018 full year guidance as compared to full year 2017.”\nUpdated Outlook for 2018\nGreen Dot has provided its updated outlook for 2018. Green Dot’s outlook is based on a number of assumptions that management believes are reasonable at the time of this earnings release. Information regarding potential risks that could cause the actual results to differ from these is set forth below and in Green Dot's filings Commission.\nTotal Operating Revenues\nGreen Dot now expects its full year total operating revenues to be between $1,002 million and $1,012 million, versus its previous guidance range of $982 million and $997 million. For Q2, Green Dot expects total operating revenues to be approximately $249 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\nGreen Dot now expects its full year adjusted EBITDA 2 to be between $240 million and $245 million, versus its previous guidance range of $236 million and $241 million. For Q2, Green Dot expects adjusted EBITDA 2 to be approximately $52 million.\nNon-GAAP EPS 2\nGreen Dot now expects its full year non-GAAP EPS 2 to be between $2.93 and $3.00, versus its previous guidance range of $2.81 and $2.88. For Q2, Green Dot expects non-GAAP EPS 2 to be approximately $0.62.\nThe components of Green Dot's non-GAAP EPS 2 guidance range are as follows:\nRange Low High (In millions except per share data) Adjusted EBITDA $ 240.0 $ 245.0 Depreciation and amortization* (42.0 ) (42.0 ) Net interest income ** 15.5 15.5 Non-GAAP pre-tax income $ 213.5 $ 218.5 Tax impact*** (53.4 ) (54.6 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 160.1 $ 163.9 Diluted weighted-average shares issued and outstanding 54.6 54.6 Non-GAAP earnings per share $ 2.93 $ 3.00 * Excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets ** Excludes the impact of amortization of deferred financing costs *** Assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 25% for full year. This rate reflects the expected impact of the new tax law (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) Supplemental Financial Presentation Information\nAs mentioned during Green Dot's previous quarterly earnings call on February 21, 2018, Green Dot will adjust its presentation of revenue beginning in 2019 to better reflect its successful evolution into a diverse technology-focused bank holding company that generates its revenue through a unique “Products and Platform” operating model.\nBeginning in 2019, Green Dot will be presenting net interest income generated at Green Dot Bank from the investment of customer deposits as a component of GAAP total operating revenues, whereas today that item is reported below operating income and is consolidated along with net interest income generated outside the bank. Net interest income at Green Dot Bank is becoming an increasingly important revenue component as Green Dot Bank's ability to invest its growing customer balances and generate interest income is one of several unique advantages of Green Dot being not just a leading consumer technology company, but also a federally regulated bank. Net interest income generated outside of Green Dot Bank will continue to be reported below the line as it is currently.\nAlso beginning in 2019, Green Dot will be presenting a new non-GAAP revenue figure that reduces GAAP total operating revenue by commissions and certain processing-related costs associated with certain “Banking as a Service,” or “BaaS,\" partner programs, where the partner and not Green Dot controls customer acquisition. Green Dot believes that a net revenue presentation will better reflect the relevant amount of revenue Green Dot generates in respect of these types of BaaS platform programs.\nThe following table provides supplemental financial presentation information for first quarter 2018 and 2017 under the new format discussed above:\n 2018 2017 (In millions) Total operating revenues $ 315.0 $ 253.0 Account generated interest income 5.3 2.8 Total operating revenues (inclusive of interest income) $ 320.3 $ 255.8 Adjustments* (13.2 ) (2.8 ) Non-GAAP Revenues $ 307.1 $ 253.0 Adjusted EBITDA 2 $ 104.1 $ 89.6 Account generated interest income 5.3 2.8 Adjusted EBITDA 2 (inclusive of interest income) $ 109.4 $ 92.4 Adjusted EBITDA 2 /Non-GAAP revenues (adjusted EBITDA margin) 35.6 % 36.5 % * Represents commissions and certain processing-related costs associated with BaaS products and services where Green Dot does not control customer acquisition Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results today at 5:00 p.m. ET.

These financial measures are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to or substitutes for operating revenues, operating income, net income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate their measures in the same manner as the Company does. These financial measures are adjusted to eliminate the impact of items that the Company does not consider indicative of its core operating performance. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the Company considers them appropriate. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures it presents are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance for the following reasons:\nthe Company records employee stock-based compensation from period to period, and recorded employee stock-based compensation expenses and related employer payroll taxes of approximately $10.5 million and $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. By comparing the Company’s adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in different historical periods, investors can evaluate the Company’s operating results without the additional variations caused by employee stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, which may not be comparable from period to period due to changes in the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock (which is influenced by external factors like the volatility of public markets and the financial performance of the Company’s peers) and is not a key measure of the Company’s operations; adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items, such as net interest income and expense, income tax benefit and expense, depreciation and amortization, employee stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, incremental expenses related to the delay in migration of the Company’s remaining customer accounts from its former processor to its new processor, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, transaction costs, impairment charges, severance costs related to extraordinary personnel reductions, legal settlement expenses, and other charges and income that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their respective financing structures and accounting policies, the book values of their assets, their capital structures and the methods by which their assets were acquired; and securities analysts use adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies.\nThe Company’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measures:\nas measures of operating performance, because they exclude the impact of items not directly resulting from the Company’s core operations; for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of the Company’s business; to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s business strategies; to establish metrics for variable compensation; and in communications with the Company’s board of directors concerning the Company’s financial performance.\nThe Company understands that, although adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, these measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results of operations as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthat these measures do not reflect the Company’s capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments; that these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs; that these measures do not reflect interest expense or interest income; that these measures do not reflect cash requirements for income taxes; that, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and that other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate these measures differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n(2) The Company does not include any income tax impact of the associated non-GAAP adjustment to adjusted EBITDA, as the case may be, because each of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided before income tax expense. (3) This expense consists primarily of expenses for restricted stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units) and related employer payroll taxes. Employee stock-based compensation expense is not comparable from period to period due to changes in the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock (which is influenced by external factors like the volatility of public markets and the financial performance of the Company’s peers) and is not a key measure of the Company’s operations. The Company excludes employee stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because it consists of non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The Company also believes that it is not useful to investors to understand the impact of employee stock-based compensation to its results of operations. Further, the related employer payroll taxes are dependent upon volatility in the Company's stock price, as well as the timing and size of option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units, over which the Company has limited to no control. This expense is included as a component of compensation and benefits expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. (4) The Company excludes certain income and expenses that are the result of acquisitions. These acquisition related adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, settlements of contingencies established at time of acquisition and other acquisition related charges, such as integration charges and professional and legal fees, which result in the Company recording expenses or fair value adjustments in its GAAP financial statements. The Company analyzes the performance of its operations without regard to these adjustments. In determining whether any acquisition related adjustment is appropriate, the Company takes into consideration, among other things, how such adjustments would or would not aid in the understanding of the performance of its operations. These items are included as a component of other general and administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. (5) The Company excludes certain income and expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in the Company's GAAP financial statements, the Company excludes them in its non-GAAP financial measures because the Company believes these items may limit the comparability of ongoing operations with prior and future periods. These adjustments include amortization attributable to deferred financing costs, impairment charges related to internal-use software, legal settlement expenses and other charges, as applicable for the periods presented. In determining whether any such adjustment is appropriate, the Company takes into consideration, among other things, how such adjustments would or would not aid in the understanding of the performance of its operations. These items, except for amortization of deferred financing costs, which is included as a component of interest expense, are included within other general and administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. (6) During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded charges of $0.1 million for severance costs related to extraordinary personnel reductions. Although severance expenses are an ordinary part of its operations, the magnitude and scale of this reduction in workforce is not expected to be repeated. This expense is included as a component of compensation and benefits expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. (7) Represents the tax effect for the related non-GAAP measure adjustments using the Company's year to date non-GAAP effective tax rate. It also excludes the impact of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and one-time favorable adjustments to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). As of March 31, 2018, the Company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. The Company’s tax benefit is provisional based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. Changes to these estimates or new guidance issued by regulators may materially impact the Company’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The Company expects to complete its accounting for the tax effects in the short term. (8) Represents the net incremental expenses associated with the Company's need to continue to support customer accounts on its legacy transaction processor that it had intended to migrate to its new processing platform in 2016. (9) These amounts represent estimated adjustments for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, employee stock-based compensation and related employer taxes, contingent consideration, transaction costs, impairment charges, severance costs related to extraordinary personnel reductions, legal settlement expenses, and other income and expenses. Employee stock-based compensation expense includes assumptions about the future fair value of the Company’s Class A common stock (which is influenced by external factors like the volatility of public markets and the financial performance of the Company’s peers).\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006434/en/\nFor Green Dot Corporation\nInvestor Relations\nIR@greendot.com\nor\nMedia Relations\nBrian Ruby, 203-682-8286\nBrian.Ruby@icrinc.com\nSource: Green Dot Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.greendot.com%2F&esheet=51803991&newsitemid=20180509006434&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.greendot.com%2F&index=3&md5=99f6e99a63697a45e8f171cb64fdeb12", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.greendot.com%2F&esheet=51803991&newsitemid=20180509006434&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.greendot.com%2F&index=1&md5=5648701c29fa36c77fc7fc0aed358ce2", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51803991&newsitemid=20180509006434&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=2&md5=2b8582e05a7c736165b54879cbd6041a", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006434/en/", "http://ir.greendot.com/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:41:13.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
