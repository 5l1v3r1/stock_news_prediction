The layoffs could also be a challenge in securing approval for the merger from South Africa’s Competition Commission.\nMagara stressed the importance of the approval of the transaction, saying more jobs were at risk should it fail to close on schedule.\nShares in Lonmin, which have lost nearly all of their value, rose 6.5 percent by 1100 GMT.\n“Looking to H2 as the smelter processes locked up material, we expect a significant working capital release, driving a net cash inflow in the half. This should reduce concerns over Sibanye walking away from the transaction,” analysts at Peel Hunt said in a note. They have a “hold” rating on the stock.\nCredit waivers that prevented Lonmin from defaulting on its loans granted in January are dependent on the company’s planned merger and the company still faced liquidity challenges, its finance head said.\n“This company’s ability to continue to as a going concern for the next 12-18 months has material uncertainties associated with it,” said CFO Barrie van der Merwe.\nTo save more cash, Lonmin lowered its full year capital expenditure target to 1.2-1.3 billion rand ($98 million-$106 million) from 1.4-1.5 billion.\nIt said unit costs for 2018 will be at the upper end of guidance but maintained is full-year sales guidance.\nIn the three months to March 31, platinum production rose to 143,374 ounces, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier.
