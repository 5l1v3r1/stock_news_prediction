REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo In January, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the News Feed, the social media company’s centerpiece service, would prioritize “high quality news” over less trusted sources as part of its fight against false information on the platform.\nFacebook has been criticized for failing to prevent false reports - originating from alleged Russia operatives, for-profit spammers and others - spreading on its platform, notably during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.\nIt has also had a stormy relationship with news organizations, especially those with strong political leanings.\nZuckerberg said in January there was too much “sensationalism, misinformation and polarization” in the world, and social media was making the problem worse.\n“Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don’t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them,” he wrote then.\nThe company, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, turned to its members to determine how news outlets ranked in terms of trustworthiness, using short surveys on the site.\nOn Thursday, it said it would start showing similar two-part surveys to users in Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, asking them if they are familiar with specific news sources, for example BBC News or the Guardian, and if they trust them.\nA Facebook spokesman said the results of the survey would not currently affect the ranking or the composition of News Feed in Britain or any of the other countries yet.\nThe company said it would announce if it decided to implement any changes.\nReporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:08:17.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
