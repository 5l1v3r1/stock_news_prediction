He gave up five runs on nine hits in six innings. He walked none and fanned three.\nCleveland set the tone with two runs in the bottom of the first. Ramirez ripped a one-out double to drive in Brantley, and he scored two batters later when Alonso singled to right field.\nTim Anderson singled home Palka to cut the deficit to 2-1 in the second.\nIn the third, Brantley put the Indians back on top by a pair of runs with a solo shot to center field. That marked his ninth home run of the season, matching his total from all of 2017.\nAfter a run-scoring single by Lindor in the fifth, Ramirez clubbed his team-leading 16th home run to make it 5-1. Ramirez has gone deep twice in his past three contests.\nBrantley added his second RBI in the seventh on a single that drove in Roberto Perez.\nKipnis hit a solo shot in the eighth for his third homer of the season.\nPalka clubbed a solo homer in the ninth.
