The right-hander was dominant from the beginning on Wednesday while his teammates provided him a six-run lead in the first five innings.\nBauer gave up just four hits and didn’t issue a walk while striking out 10. Cody Allen recorded three strikeouts in the ninth inning.\nMichael Brantley led the offense with three hits, including a solo homer, and two runs scored. Erik Gonzalez added two hits, a run scored and an RBI.\nLeft-hander Ryan Carpenter (0-1), recalled from Triple-A Toledo on Tuesday, took the loss. Making his second career start, Carpenter allowed six runs (five earned) on seven hits in five innings.\nArtie Lewicki, elevated from Triple-A Toledo on Wednesday, tossed four scoreless innings for Detroit, which had won four of its last five games.\nTigers center fielder JaCoby Jones left the game after two innings with a left hip contusion.\nCarpenter gave up two runs in the first inning, in part because of his own fielding error. Rajai Davis and Brantley opened the game with singles. Carpenter’s throwing error on Jose Ramirez’s grounder allowed Davis to score and Brantley to reach third. Francisco Lindor’s sacrifice fly knocked in Brantley.\nCleveland extended its lead to 5-0 with three two-out runs in the fourth. Gonzalez brought in the first one with a single. Jason Kipnis followed with a double down the right-field line as Gonzalez scampered home. Kipnis scored on Roberto Perez’s single.\nBrantley led off the fifth with his sixth homer, a blast that cleared the wall in right-center.\nBauer set down the first 12 batters before Niko Goodrum led off the bottom of the fifth with a line single. Goodrum was quickly erased by a double play.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:25:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
