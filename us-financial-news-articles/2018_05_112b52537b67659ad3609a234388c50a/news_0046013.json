Soccer Football - 2018 FIFA World Cup Draw - State Kremlin Palace, Moscow, Russia - December 1, 2017 France coach Didier Deschamps and Morocco coach Herve Renard after the draw REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nThe north Africans were paired with reigning European champions Portugal and their predecessors Spain in Group B, and open their campaign with a tough encounter against Iran.\nThey need to start with victory in St. Petersburg on June 15 to stand any chance of progress and then hope that they might steal some points off the two heavyweights in their next two group games.\nMorocco will pose a tough challenge but might not have the depth to achieve their ambition of progressing beyond the first round.\nTheir squad draws heavily from the diasporas in Europe and benefits greatly from players born or brought up in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Spain.\nThe Dutch flair of Mbark Boussoufa, Hakim Ziyech and Nordin Amrabat pairs well with the likes of French-born Younes Belhanda and Mehdi Benatia. The ‘Atlas Lions’ have also seen Spanish-born Achraf Hakimi make a La Liga debut for Real Madrid this season.\nBut Morocco’s weaknesses in goal and at center forward, where constant switches in selection reflect the ongoing search for a solution, pose a serious problem.
