There are options, when negotiating, for the number to be 8, 9 or 10.”\nKarakachanov, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, did not say which aircraft the government should consider. “I will not go into the details of the conversations that we have held in advance or what kind of proposals we have received,” he said.\nSome eastern European NATO allies that were once Soviet satellites still rely on Russian warplanes - two-thirds of Poland’s military equipment dates from the Soviet era, for example.\nUnder the 2016 plan, Bulgaria was supposed to acquire the eight jets between 2018 and 2020 in a 1.5 billion lev ($923 million) deal to improve its compliance with NATO standards.\nThe process, however, hit procedural snags and is expected to start almost from scratch at a government meeting next week.\nIn June last year Sofia said it would start talks to buy new Gripen warplanes from Swedish manufacturer Saab but the purchase was put on hold after lawmakers questioned if all bidders for the contract had been treated equally.\nThree months later Prime Minister Boyko Borissov also expressed doubt that the Gripen was the best choice, although he had initially told his Swedish counterpart that negotiations on buying them would proceed within weeks.\nBulgaria also received offers from Portugal for secondhand U.S. F-16s and from Italy for secondhand Eurofighter Typhoons.\nReporting by Angel Krasimirov; editing by David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:52:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
