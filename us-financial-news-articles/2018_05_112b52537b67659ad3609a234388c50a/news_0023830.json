The decrease from fourth quarter 2017 is primarily due to an approximate $27 million reduction in net gains and losses related to divestitures and impairments.\nAdjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $93.4 million in first quarter 2018, compared to $111.5 million in fourth quarter 2017 and $60.7 million in first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled to net income below.\n“We have executed extremely well so far this year by closing on the sale of two non-core businesses; executing a capital raise; funding the HFOTCO final payment and announcing the contract-supported conversion of one of our White Cliffs crude pipelines to NGL service,” said SemGroup President and Chief Executive Officer Carlin Conner. “We've successfully streamlined and strengthened our portfolio with nearly 60 percent of our gross margin now driven by secure take-or-pay contracts. We are on track with our two largest growth projects that will drive future earnings growth at HFOTCO and Canada. Our first quarter results, absent a one-time adjustment, delivered expected earnings. In the second half of the year we expect incremental new EBITDA from our HFOTCO expansion, as well as an increase in our Mid-Continent volumes. The reliability of our cash flow supports our ongoing capital reinvestment and dividend growth projections.”\nRecent Developments\nOn April 12, SemGroup announced it had completed the sale of its SemLogistics business unit, a petroleum storage facility in the United Kingdom, to Valero Logistics UK Ltd, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation.\nOn April 17, SemGroup made the final payment related to the HFOTCO acquisition in the amount of $579.6 million, reflecting the early payment discount of approximately $20 million. The payment was funded through revolving credit facility borrowings and cash on hand.\nOn May 1, SemGroup announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders. A dividend in the amount of $0.4725 per share, or $1.89 per share annualized, will be paid on May 25, 2018 to all common shareholders of record on May 16, 2018.\nAlso on May 1, SemGroup announced that its dividend to holders of its 7% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock. The company elected, pursuant to the terms of the convertible preferred shares, to have the quarterly dividend added to the liquidation preference of such shares as a payment in kind. The record date for the payment in kind on the shares of convertible preferred stock is May 16, 2018 and the payment date is May 25, 2018.\nOn May 7, SemGroup announced plans to convert a portion of the White Cliffs Pipeline system to natural gas liquids (NGL) service. SemGroup owns 51 percent of White Cliffs Pipeline and is the operator. The project is backstopped by 10-year agreements with DCP Midstream, LP (NYSE:DCP) and its affiliate DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC. The pipeline conversion will diversify White Cliffs Pipeline delivery capabilities and enhance service to Colorado’s growing DJ Basin. As operator, SemGroup will convert one of the 12-inch-diameter pipelines from crude service to NGL Y-grade service connecting the DJ Basin to Cushing, Okla. The pipeline will have an initial capacity of 90,000 barrels per day and will be expandable up to 120,000 barrels per day. It will be taken out of service late first quarter 2019 for conversion and is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter 2019. As part of the project, SemGroup will construct a 12-mile extension of White Cliffs Pipeline south of Cushing to interconnect with Southern Hills Pipeline in order to move NGLs south to Mont Belvieu via Southern Hills. The 10-year agreements provide DCP and Southern Hills with 50,000 barrels per day of NGL transportation capacity on the converted White Cliffs Pipeline. The project is estimated to cost between $60 million and $66 million, of which SemGroup will fund 51 percent. SemGroup anticipates minimal spending on this project in 2018. Based on the currently executed contract, the project is estimated to be constructed at less than 4x EBITDA multiple. White Cliffs Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline will soon conduct a joint binding open season to attract additional commitments from other producers and processors in the DJ Basin. Shippers will move product under a published joint tariff between the two carriers.\nSegment Profit\nSemGroup management believes segment profit is a valuable measure of the operating and financial performance of the company's operating segments. Segment profit is defined as revenue, less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and operating expenses, plus equity earnings and is adjusted to remove unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis. Reconciliations can be found in the tables of this release.\n“Excluding the one-time insurance write-off at HFOTCO, our first quarter results were right in line with expectations,” said SemGroup Chief Financial Officer Bob Fitzgerald. “We expect operating results to increase throughout the year as volumes in our core operating areas continue to grow and new expansion projects come on line this summer.”\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Segment Profit: 2018 2017 2017 Crude Transportation $ 34,310 $ 28,251 $ 41,641 Crude Facilities 9,341 9,564 14,116 Crude Supply and Logistics (6,583 ) (2,428 ) (1,507 ) HFOTCO 30,988 — 33,032 SemGas 14,277 18,227 14,539 SemCAMS 22,113 16,865 23,668 Other and eliminations 10,963 8,367 8,153 Total Segment Profit $ 115,409 $ 78,846 $ 133,642 Performance by Segment Profit - First Quarter 2018 vs. Fourth Quarter 2017\nCrude Transportation decreased $7.3 million due to the absence of approximately $4 million related to Glass Mountain Pipeline earnings in fourth quarter 2017. Field Services decreased $4 million due to lower volumes primarily related to weather impacts during the quarter. Crude Facilities decreased $4.8 million related to the recognition of an approximately $5 million take-or-pay deficiency in fourth quarter 2017. Crude Supply and Logistics decreased $5 million primarily due to lower marketing and blending margins. HFOTCO was down $2 million. Increased throughput volumes were more than offset by a $4 million write-off of an insurance claim receivable. SemGas was flat with growing STACK volumes more than offsetting a decline in Mississippi Lime volumes. SemCAMS decreased $1.5 million due to the absence of producer recoveries in fourth quarter 2017, offset partially by the recognition of certain take-or-pay deficiency revenues in the first quarter 2018.\nSelect Operating Statistics 1Q2018 1Q 2017 4Q 2017 Crude Transportation Transportation Volumes (mbbl/d) 182 179 193 White Cliffs Pipeline Volumes (mbbl/d) 107 111 92 Crude Facilities Cushing Terminal Utilization % 98 % 100 % 100 % HFOTCO Average Terminal Utilization % 97 % N/A 98 % SemGas (1) Total Average Processing Volumes (mmcf/d) 305 287 252 SemCAMS (2) Total Average Throughput Volumes (mmcf/d) 441 414 452 (1) SemGas volumes include total volumes processed - Northern Oklahoma and Sherman, Texas\n(2) SemCAMS volumes include total volumes processed - K3, KA and West Fox Creek facilities\nGuidance Outlook\nBased on our first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of 2018, SemGroup is affirming its initial financial guidance provided earlier this year.\nEarnings Conference Call\nSemGroup will host a conference call for investors at 11 a.m. Eastern, May 9, 2018.

Such information is routinely posted and accessible on our Investor Relations website at www.semgroupcorp.com , our Twitter account and LinkedIn account.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSemGroup’s non-GAAP measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Total Segment Profit, are not GAAP measures and are not intended to be used in lieu of GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and operating income, respectively, which are the most closely associated GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for selected items that SemGroup believes impact the comparability of financial results between reporting periods. In addition to non-cash items, we have selected items for adjustment to EBITDA which management feels decrease the comparability of our results among periods. These items are identified as those which are generally outside of the results of day to day operations of the business. These items are not considered non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, but do erode comparability among periods in which they occur with periods in which they do not occur or occur to a greater or lesser degree. Historically, we have selected items such as gains on the sale of NGL Energy Partners LP common units, costs related to our predecessor’s bankruptcy, significant business development related costs, significant legal settlements, severance and other similar costs. Management believes these types of items can make comparability of the results of day to day operations among periods difficult and have chosen to remove these items from our Adjusted EBITDA. We expect to adjust for similar types of items in the future. Although we present selected items that we consider in evaluating our performance, you should be aware that the items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods presented. Variations in our operating results are also caused by changes in volumes, prices, mechanical interruptions and numerous other factors. We do not adjust for these types of variances.\nTotal Segment Profit represents revenue, less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and operating expenses, plus equity earnings and is adjusted to remove unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis. Reflecting equity earnings on an EBITDA basis is achieved by adjusting equity earnings to exclude our percentage of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from equity earnings for operated equity method investees. For our investment in NGL Energy, we exclude equity earnings and include cash distributions received. Segment profit is the measure by which management assess the performance of our reportable segments.\nThese measures may be used periodically by management when discussing our financial results with investors and analysts and are presented as management believes they provide additional information and metrics relative to the performance of our businesses. These non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they excludes some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of our non-GAAP measures as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results. Because all companies do not use identical calculations, our presentations of non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters contained in this Press Release include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
