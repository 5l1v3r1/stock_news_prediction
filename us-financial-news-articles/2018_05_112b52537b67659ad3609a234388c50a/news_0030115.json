It also includes three tiny red escallops from the Spencer family Arms, the family of Harry’s mother, the late Princess Diana.\nRepresenting Markle, the design to the right of the text includes the rose, the national flower of the United States, while two golden poppies are the state flower of California, where Markle was born.\nThe document, which will be given to the couple after the wedding, is drafted by the Crown Office and illuminated on vellum, a fine parchment made from the skin of a calf that is only used for important state documents.\nIt was made by one of a panel of scrivener artists.
