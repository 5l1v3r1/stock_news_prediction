(SEER) (OTCQB:SENR), a provider of environmental, renewable fuels and industrial waste stream management services, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue in Q1 2018 was $1.9 million versus $2.6 million in Q1 2017.\nQ1 2018 net revenue was $0.9 million in Industrial Cleaning (REGS), $0.9 million in Environmental Technology Solutions (MV/SEM) and $0.1 million in Solid Waste (Paragon Waste Solutions).\nGross profit margin in Q1 2018 was 24.3% vs. 27.2% in Q1 2017.\nGAAP net loss attributable to SEER was $0.7 million in Q1 2018 versus a net loss of $0.4 million in Q1 2017.\nQ1 2018 adjusted EBITDA loss was $0.2 million compared to a profit of $0.3 million in Q1 2017.\nQ1 2018 net cash used in operations totaled $0.2 million versus $0.7 million in Q1 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Subsequent Financial and Operational Highlights by Division\nEnvironmental Technology Solutions (MV & SEM)\nFinancial\nEnvironmental Solutions Q1 2018 revenue was $0.9 million, a decrease of 48% when compared to Q1 2017 revenue of $1.7 million. Gross profit decreased from $0.5 million in Q1 2017 to $0.3 million in Q1 2018. The lower gross profit in Q1 2018 was primarily due to the year-over-year revenue decrease.\nOperational\nMV continues to receive high-margin, recurring revenue from media replacement sales to over 30 anaerobic digester systems installed and operational across North America.\nContinued targeting replacement media sales to the large, existing base of non-MV systems with its exclusive distributorship of Axens NA media, which is also expected to minimize the impact of periodic lulls in new system orders.\nContinued to market rental systems and accompanying AxTrap granular iron oxide media in Northern California to landfills that need to comply with California’s increasingly stringent disposal requirements.\nKicked off new marketing campaign focused on placement of rental systems and already placed a rental system in a landfill in Northern California. The rental system uses MV’s exclusively licensed Axens NA AxTrap granular iron oxide media. This media is specifically formulated to comply with California’s more stringent disposal requirements. The rental system will generate approximately $75,000/month of revenue between the equipment and the ongoing sales of AxTrap media. It is estimated the rental system will be in place for 6-12 months. MV is working with the landfill to design, supply and install a permanent system to keep the landfill in long-term compliance and has been contacted by another landfill operator in Central California and expects to install a similar rental system at that location. Paragon Waste Solutions - CoronaLux™\nManaged successful start-up of Paragon Southwest Medical Waste, LLC (PSMW), a waste destruction facility in Anahuac, Texas. The operation is utilizing three CoronaLux systems and generated approximately $50,000 in revenue to Paragon during the quarter. The facility has set a precedence in the industry as it represents the first time an established incinerator operator has idled legacy equipment in favor of the CoronaLux technology.\nSeveral significant customer waste agreements have been signed by the Texas facility in the first months of operation, and a number of other agreements are being negotiated.\nContinued to engage with additional medical waste partners in Southern California, Texas, Florida (Broward & Orange counties) and North Carolina (Guilford County) to initiate or expand operations. REGS\nInitiated service work on several new projects during the quarter, including continuing work in the Midwest and expects to start over $500,000 in new projects this quarter.\nActivity continues to ramp surrounding the partnership with Biochar Now (BCN), particularly with the expansion of manufacturing capabilities for kiln production. BCN manufacturers high-quality and patented biochar. REGS expects to successfully leverage its relationships in the mining industry to enable initial market penetration.\nREGS is also working with leading water experts and service companies to expedite the deployment of its technology within the water treatment market.\nDebt financing is expected in the short term to enable increased capacity and specialized manufacturing capabilities to fulfill an anticipated $2.4 million in kiln orders from BCN over the next two quarters.\nManagement Commentary\n“The first quarter was highlighted by initiation of our revenue ramp at the Paragon Southwest Medical Waste facility in Anahuac, Texas,” stated John Combs, CEO of SEER. “We recognized initial revenues and management fees from the joint venture during the first quarter and expect to realize increasing volume and revenue as the year progresses and operations ramp. This represents a demonstrable foothold in the industry for our proprietary CoronaLux™ technology and we look forward to continuing to supply CoronaLux™ systems to the joint venture as operations continue to scale in the licensed region.\n“Although a temporary decline in long-term contract revenue dampened revenue growth from the Environmental Solutions segment, we remain encouraged by the growth in our media replacement sales. We expect spikes in large system revenue due to the sales cycle of these products, so in order to offset this impact, the build-out of steadier, high-margin, recurring revenues leveraging our highly competitive media product offerings continues to be a major strategic priority of our management team.\n“We experienced modest growth in the Industrial Cleaning segment and expect new projects to materialize starting in the second quarter. We are increasingly disciplined about the service work we bid on and expect this strategy to positively impact our future margins in the segment. Of note, our partnership with Biochar Now continues to progress and we look forward to providing operational updates on that front as soon as appropriate.\n“Based on recent industry response, we continue to be optimistic regarding the revenue ramp in our Solid Waste segment as the CoronaLux™ technology sees increasing adoption nationwide.\n“While we are not holding a quarterly call in the first quarter due to its proximity to our recent fourth quarter call, we do see several notable operational milestones on the horizon and look forward to holding an update call in early June,” concluded Combs.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $1.9 million compared to $2.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower revenues from the Environmental Solutions segment as the result of fewer large system sales.\nIndustrial Cleaning revenue in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.9 million versus $0.8 million in the same year-ago quarter.\nEnvironmental Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.9 million versus $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower large-system sales revenue.\nSolid Waste (PWS) net revenue in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $97,400 versus $69,300 in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in solid waste revenue in the first quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to the start-up of the facility in Anahuac, Texas.\nGross margin in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to 24.3% from 27.2% in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in quarterly gross margin was due to lower revenues from the Environmental Solutions segment.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $2.3 million, compared to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in total operating expenses is primarily attributable to a $0.6 million decrease in product costs.\nNet loss attributable to SEER in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.7 million or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.4 million or ($0.01) per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.2 million, compared to a profit of $0.3 million in the same year-ago quarter (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).\nCash at March 31, 2018, totaled $0.2 million compared to $0.3 million at March 31, 2017.\nFurther details about the company’s results in the first quarter of 2018 are available in its Quarterly Report Form 10-Q, accessible in the investor relations section of the company’s website at www.seer-corp.com .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary Tables\nThe following financial information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 2018 in its Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018, and which can be viewed at www.sec.gov and in the investor relations section of the company’s website at www.seer-corp.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company believes that the presentation of results excluding certain items in \"Modified EBITDA,\" such as non-cash equity compensation charges, provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods.
