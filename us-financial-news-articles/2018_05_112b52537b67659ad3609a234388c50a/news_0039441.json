The Russian businessman and his Renova Group were added to the list of U.S.-sanctioned individuals and entities on April 6.\nThe official programme of the forum, which runs from May 24-26, included Huntsman as panelist, Russian media reported in May. As of Thursday, he was no longer on the list.\nThe United States imposed major sanctions against 24 Russians deemed close to President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity.” Reporting by Maxim Rodionov, editing by Richard Balmforth", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:37:54.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
