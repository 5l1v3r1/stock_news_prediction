Match, the owner of popular mobile dating app Tinder and OkCupid, calls itself the \"global leader in dating\" on its website.\n\"But the initial functionality looks relatively basic compared to those offered by Match's services, so the impact Facebook has on the dating space will be down to how well it executes in this area,\" Cordwell said.\nMatch Group shares fell more than 23 percent on the news of Facebook's service. IAC, Match Group's parent company, dropped more than 15 percent. Sparks Networks, owner of JDate and ChristianMingle, fell 7.3 percent.\nA prototype displayed on screens at the F8 conference showed a heart shape at the top-right corner of the Facebook app. Pressing on it will take people to their dating profile if they have set one up.\nThe prototype was built around local, in-person events, allowing people to browse other attendees and send them messages.\nIt did not appear to have a feature to \"swipe\" left or right on potential matches to signal interest, as Tinder and other established services have.\nThe feature will be for finding long-term relationships, \"not just hook-ups,\" Zuckerberg said. It will be optional and will launch soon, he added, without giving a specific day.\nFacebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in a separate presentation that the company would share more over the next few months.\nCox said he had been thinking about a dating feature on Facebook since 2005, when he joined the company about a year after its founding.\nThe company began seriously considering adding a dating service in 2016, when Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook page a photo of a couple who had met on the network, Cox said.\nThousands of people responded to Zuckerberg's post with similar stories about meeting partners on Facebook, Cox said. \"That's what got the gears turning,\" he said.\nPeople will be able to start a conversation with a potential match by commenting on one of their photos, but for safety reasons that Cox did not specify, the conversations will be text-only, he said.\nFacebook executives were quick to highlight other features for safety and privacy, noting that dating activity would not show up in Facebook's centerpiece News Feed.\nConcerns about privacy on Facebook have grown since the social network's admission in March that the data of millions of users was wrongly harvested by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\nA dating service \"represents a potentially challenging situation if Facebook can't fulfill its promise to offer dating services in a privacy-protected and safe way,\" said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer.\nHowever, \"I'm sure it will make good use of the data Facebook has been able to collect about its users,\" she added.\nZuckerberg also said on Tuesday that Facebook was building a new privacy control called \"clear history\" to allow users to delete browsing history, similar to the option of clearing cookies in a browser.\n(Reporting by David Ingram in San Jose; Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Richard Chang)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T22:57:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
