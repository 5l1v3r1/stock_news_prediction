(NASDAQ:UBNT) (“Ubiquiti\" or the \"Company”) today announced results for the third fiscal quarter of 2018, ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenues of $250.4 million , increasing 14.7% year-over-year Repurchased 4,389,195 shares of common stock through May 7, 2018, at an average price of $66.53 per share Initiated a new $200 million stock repurchase program , as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed on May 10, 2018 Repatriated $677.2 million in cash from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. banks Entered into a new credit facility , providing for a $500 million term loan and $400 million revolving credit facility, as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2018\nFinancial Highlights ($, in millions, except per share data)\nIncome statement highlights F3Q18 F2Q18 F3Q17 Revenues 250.4 250.8 218.4 Service Provider Technology 100.9 119.9 104.7 Enterprise Technology 149.5 131.0 113.6 Gross profit 114.5 96.9 99.1 Gross Profit (%) 45.7% 38.6% 45.4% Total Operating Expenses 29.6 30.8 25.7 Income from Operations 84.9 66.1 73.4 GAAP Net Income/(Loss) 102.7 (51.5) 64.4 GAAP EPS (diluted) 1.32 (0.66) 0.77 Non-GAAP Net Income 76.0 59.6 64.6 Non-GAAP EPS (diluted) 0.98 0.76 0.78 Gross Margins\nDuring this quarter, GAAP gross profit was $114.5 million. GAAP gross margin of 45.7% increased versus the prior year gross margin of 45.4%. Third quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP gross margin sequential increase was driven by the $18.6 million taken in provisions for obsolete inventory, vendor deposits and loss on purchase commitments during the second quarter fiscal 2018.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nCash. Total cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were $690.8 million, compared with $604.2 million as of June 30, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company held $128.6 million of cash and cash equivalents in accounts of the Company’s subsidiaries outside of the United States. Cash and cash equivalents, less debt (net cash) of $199.9 million decreased $156.2 million sequentially. The sequential decrease in net cash during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the repurchase of common stock and was partially offset by operating earnings. Note that $22.0 million in share repurchases made during the third quarter fiscal 2018 were settled during the fourth quarter fiscal 2018.\nThe Company repatriated $677.2 million in cash from its foreign subsidiaries to U.S. banks, providing liquidity for the Company's share repurchase program.\nBorrowing Availability. On January 17, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement. The agreement provides credit facilities of $900 million, consisting of a $500 million term loan which was entirely drawn at closing and a $400 million revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn as of March 31, 2018.\nDSOs. Third quarter fiscal 2018 days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (\"DSO\") were 57 days, compared with 58 days in the prior quarter, and 52 days in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nInventory. Inventory at the end of the quarter decreased $6.1 million to $92.8 million. Inventory weeks on hand decreased slightly on a sequential basis to 9.1 weeks in the current quarter versus 9.4 weeks the prior quarter.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on recent business trends, the Company believes that it is on track to achieve the low-end of the revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings-per-share guidance previously provided for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 and has no update to previously provided long-term guidance.\nConference Call Information\nUbiquiti Networks will host a Q&A-only call to discuss the Company’s financial results at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.

Included in the Company’s second fiscal quarter transition tax calculation is an approximate $2.1 million benefit recorded in the second fiscal quarter related to the reduced domestic rate to 28% on the first fiscal quarter 2018 earnings which were previously provided for at the 35% rate. As the year to date provision reflects the impact of the reduced 28% rate for the nine-month results, this $2.1 million benefit was not removed from the non-GAAP results for the nine-month period ending March 31, 2018. As a result, the Company’s non-GAAP Tax Reform Transition Tax adjustment for the nine months will differ from the three months period by the $2.1 million benefit made during the second quarter fiscal 2018 related to first fiscal quarter 2018 earnings.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial results prepared under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of net income and earnings per diluted share that are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses and gains such as stock-based compensation expense, net tax benefits related to equity awards exercises and vesting, the tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments, the SEC related matters and Tax Reform Transition Tax.\nReconciliations of the adjustments to GAAP results for the periods presented are provided above. In addition, an explanation of the ways in which management uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its business, the substance behind management's decision to use this non-GAAP financial information, material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial information, the manner in which management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons management believes that this non-GAAP financial information provides useful information to investors is included under \"About our Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjustments\" above.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from these non-GAAP measures. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future price at which the Company’s stock will trade in those future periods. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results. Certain exclusions, such as share-based compensation expenses, are generally incurred each quarter, but the amounts have histoically and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe believe that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share provides important supplemental information regarding non-cash expenses, significant items that we believe are important to understanding our financial, and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met specified targets and thresholds. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes that the exclusion of the items described below, for which the amounts or timing may vary significantly depending upon the Company's activities and other factors, facilitates comparability of the Company's operating performance from period to period. We have chosen to provide this information to investors so they can analyze our operating results in the same way that management does and use this information in their assessment of our business and the valuation of our Company.\nUse and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures used by Ubiquiti Networks\nWe compute non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by adjusting GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per diluted share to remove the impact of certain adjustments and the tax effect of those adjustments. Items excluded from net income are:\nSEC related matters Stock-based compensation expense Net Tax Benefits related to Equity Awards Exercises and Vesting Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments, applying the principles of ASC 740 Tax Reform Transition Tax\nUsefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Information to Investors\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and may be materially different from other non-GAAP measures, including similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, net income or earnings per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results.\nFor more information on the non-GAAP adjustments, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income” included in this press release.\nUbiquiti Networks, Inc.
