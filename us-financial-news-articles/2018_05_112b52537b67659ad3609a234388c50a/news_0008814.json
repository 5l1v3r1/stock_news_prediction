In Paris, hundreds of masked and hooded anarchists smashed shop windows, torched cars and hurled cobblestones at riot police on Tuesday, hijacking a May Day rally by labor unions against President Emmanuel Macron’s economic reforms.\nA demonstrator holds his fist in the air during a rally commemorating May Day at Union Square in New York, U.S., May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton FESTIVE AND DEFIANT Tuesday’s Los Angeles turnout under cloudy skies and a slight drizzle was considerably diminished from the thousands who took to the streets of America’s second-largest city in 2017, for the first May Day celebration after Trump took office.\nBut the mood was festive and defiant, nevertheless.\n“No rain, no clouds, no hate, no division is going to keep workers from celebrating with immigrants, with refugees ... with the LGBT community, with the criminal justice reform community, with the environmental justice community,” union leader Laphonza Butler told the crowd, speaking from a flat-bed truck.\nButler heads the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 2015, representing some 380,000 long-term healthcare workers statewide, one of the largest collective bargaining units in the nation.\nBut marchers represented a broad cross-section of organized labor and other constituencies, from the Teamsters union and nurses to street vendors and a group called the Clean Carwash Campaign.\n“May First is a celebration of workers, and a lot of workers in this city are immigrants,” said Karla Cativo, 36, a community organizer with the Salvadoran American Leadership and Educational Fund, which provides services to Central American immigrants.\nSlideshow (20 Images) Cativo, a Salvadoran native who entered the United States as an undocumented immigrant, said she gained U.S. citizenship with “a lot of work and because of a lot of people fighting for my rights.”\nFellow protester Fabian Barcenas, 55, said he wanted to give voice to “millions of workers who pay taxes and support their families who don’t have the chance of having legal status here.”\nReporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York, John Herskovitz in Austin, Texas, and Omar Younis in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T05:27:50.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
