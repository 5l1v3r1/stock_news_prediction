If the negotiators were sufficiently “creative” and “flexible,” a successful outcome was probable, Guajardo added.\nThe minister was speaking a day after the Trump administration decided to extend by one month an exemption for Mexico and Canada to planned steel and aluminum tariffs.\nGuajardo said Mexico would not accept the U.S. imposition of tariffs, and that his government could mirror U.S. policy to ensure Mexico did not become a “back door” to the United States for steel or aluminum imports from Asia in particular, he said.\nHe stressed, however, that the steel and aluminum dispute was completely separate from the NAFTA negotiations.\nThe minister noted that the three sides remained at odds over a number of issues, including U.S. demands to change dispute resolution mechanisms and to impose a sunset clause that could automatically kill NAFTA after five years.
