REUTERS/Yannis Behrakis\nThe health check by the European Central Bank, aimed at uncovering any capital shortage before Athens exits its 86 billion-euro ($106 billion) bailout in August, was carried out separately from a stress test of other euro zone banks.\nTest results for 33 lenders from other euro zone countries will be published in early November.\nThe ECB’s stress test of Greece’s four largest banks - Piraeus ( BOPr.AT ), NBG ( NBGr.AT ), Eurobank ( EURBr.AT ) and Alpha ( ACBr.AT ) - was done early to allow time for any possible capital shortfall to be filled before Athens leaves its bailout.\nAmong the banks, Alpha Bank performed best as its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) would drop by 8.56 percentage points to 9.69 percent according the adverse scenario of the test.

They have committed to targets to reduce that load to 65 billion euros by 2019.\nMay’s exercise was their fourth stress test during the eight-year debt crisis. Their first recapitalisation took place in 2013 when a bank rescue fund, funded by its euro zone lenders and the IMF, pumped 25 billion euros into the four banks, while another 3.5 billion was raised from private investors.\nAfter another health check in 2014, banks raised 8.3 billion euros from private investors on prospects of a recovery. But this proved futile a year later as a new leftist government in Athens clashed with official lenders, sparking a massive flight of deposits which led to capital controls.\nBanks were forced to undergo another stress test and recapitalize again in 2015 at beaten down share prices, severely diluting existing shareholders. A total of 12 billion euros was pumped into them via rights issues and CoCo bonds.\nBanks have been under regulatory pressure to tackle the bad debt problem, which restricts their ability to expand credit and help the economy recover. So-called non-performing exposures (NPEs) are the biggest challenge facing the sector.
