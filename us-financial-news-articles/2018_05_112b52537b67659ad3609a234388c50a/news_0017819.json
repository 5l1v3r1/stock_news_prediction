I had no confidence in my ability to hit proper tee shots. I was just trying to keep it inside the tree line.

My next step is to try to win a major this year.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Ken Ferris/Ian Ransom", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T01:14:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
