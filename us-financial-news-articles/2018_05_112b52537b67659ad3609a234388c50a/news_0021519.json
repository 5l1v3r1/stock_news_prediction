Photo: Jason Keen for The Wall Street Journal Bob Boniface, 52, director of exterior design at General Motors’ Buick division, from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., on his 1962 Ferrari 250 GTE, as told to A.J. Baime.\nMy father, Raymond, was a physician, and when I was growing up, he owned some Ferraris. In 1973, he bought the one pictured here for $3,800 to use as his daily driver. These were not expensive cars at the time.\nWe knew from the registration card that this Ferrari’s original owner had been British actor Peter Sellers. We later learned that the vehicle had been delivered to Mr. Sellers while he was on the set of the 1963 movie “The Wrong Arm of the Law.” The car appears in that movie. (It was white at the time.)\nPhotos: A G.M. Exec With a Fabulous Ferrari Story A Michigan car executive shows off the 1962 GTE that’s been in and out of his life for over four decades Bob Boniface in his 1962 Ferrari GTE. Mr. Boniface’s father owned this car from 1973 to 1975. Mr. Boniface found it and brought it back into the family last year. Jason Keen for The Wall Street Journal 1 of 10 • • • • • The 250 GTE was the first four-seat Ferrari ever produced in any volume. Enzo Ferrari launched his car company in the late 1940s and he sold a small number of street cars to wealthy clientele to fund his racing program. By the 1960s, he had become the most successful race-car builder in the world. Our 250 GTE was a window into Enzo Ferrari’s work during his heyday.\nIn 1975, my father sold the car for $4,800. He had owned it for two years and made a thousand dollars. He laughed all the way to the bank.\nFour years ago, my father found the original owners’ manual in his library. It had the registration card with Peter Sellers’s signature on it. He called me and said, “You’re connected in the car world. You should find that old Ferrari so we can give the owner this manual, as it is an important piece of history.”\nI looked for the car for three years. Last year, I posted a message on a Ferrari website and I received a private message back saying, “I bought the car from your father over 40 years ago and I still have it. I restored it. I am thinking of selling, if you’re interested.” The guy remembered meeting me when I was a boy.\nWe struck a deal. It was not cheap, but the owner wanted the car to go to someone who appreciated its history, so he sold it for under market value.\nIn April 2017, I got the car to my house. My father, now 93, came over. I said, “The last time we were in this car together, you drove. Now it’s my turn.” We went for a drive. He was over the moon, and so was I.\n—Contact A.J.
