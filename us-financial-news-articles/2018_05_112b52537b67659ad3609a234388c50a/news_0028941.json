The appeals court sat in Portland.\nIn a statement, Adidas said “we will not stand by and allow others to blatantly copy our products,” and that it was “committed to bringing a complete end to Skechers’ pattern of unlawful conduct” at trial.\nSkechers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit is one of many by footwear makers seeking to protect their patent and trademark rights.\nMany are filed by companies such as Adidas against companies such as Skechers whose products sell for lower prices.\nAdidas has sued Skechers several times in the last two decades for alleged infringement of its three-stripe trademark.\nIn Thursday’s decision, Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen said the Stan Smith, named for the early 1970s American tennis star, has enjoyed “tremendous commercial success and market recognition,” and Adidas might face irreparable harm if similar shoes flooded the market.\nShe also said evidence suggested that Skechers intended to confuse consumers by creating the “nearly identical” Onix, and then directing consumers who searched online for “adidas stan smith” to the Onix website.\nIn contrast, Nguyen said Adidas failed to show that consumers would associate it with Skechers’ Cross Court, causing the dilution of Adidas’ reputation as a “premium” brand.\nCircuit Judge Richard Clifton would have upheld the entire injunction.\nThe case is Adidas America Inc et al v Skechers USA Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-35204.
