Meanwhile, Shopee continues to grow ahead of expectations as we capture a larger share of our region's e-commerce market, and the virtuous cycle created by that accelerated scaling is driving ever-improving economics on our platform,\" said Forrest Li, Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer of Sea. \"We will continue to invest in growth, and to focus on improving our services to our platform users, as well as the infrastructure supporting our core businesses.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Key Metrics\n-Group\nTotal adjusted revenue was US$197.0 million, up 81.2% year-on-year from US$108.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 and up 19.8% quarter-on-quarter from US$164.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Total adjusted EBITDA was US$(144.7) million, compared to US$(41.4) million for the first quarter of 2017 and US$(140.2) million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n-Digital Entertainment\nAdjusted revenue was US$146.0 million, up 42.6% year-on-year from US$102.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and up 2.9% quarter-on-quarter from US$141.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was US$55.0 million, an increase of 48.6% year-on-year from US$37.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and up 4.6% quarter-on-quarter from $52.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Quarterly active users (\"QAUs\") reached 126.7 million, an increase of 124.6% year-on-year from 56.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and up 44.3% quarter-on-quarter from 87.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAverage revenue per user (\"ARPU\") was US$1.2 compared to US$1.8 for the first quarter of 2017 and US$1.6 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n-E-commerce\nGross merchandise value (\"GMV\") was US$1.9 billion, an increase of 199.5% year-on-year from US$648.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 and up 23.0% quarter-on-quarter from US$1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross orders for the quarter totaled 111.4 million, an increase of 217.4% year-on-year from 35.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 and up 13.3% quarter-on-quarter from 98.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted revenue was US$33.7 million, up 262.1% quarter-on-quarter from US$9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted revenue included US$22.0 million of marketplace revenue [1] and US$11.7 million of product revenue [2] . There was negligible e-commerce adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was US$(179.6) million, compared to US$(62.7) million for the first quarter of 2017 and US$(175.4) million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Sales and marketing as a percentage of GMV stood at 6.6%, and improved from 7.1% for the first quarter of 2017 and 8.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n- Digital Financial Services\nGross transaction value of our digital financial services as a whole (\"GTV\") was US$1.7 billion, an increase of 428.6% year-on-year from US$322.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and up 65.7% quarter-on-quarter from US$1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth was attributable to the payment processing services provided by AirPay to Shopee in most of our markets, which, depending on the operational arrangement in each relevant market, may include payments from buyers to Shopee accounts under Shopee Guarantee as well as outgoing payments from Shopee accounts to Shopee seller accounts that are operationally handled by AirPay.\n[1] Marketplace revenue mainly consists of commission and advertising income and revenue generated from other value-added services.\n[2] Product revenue mainly consists of revenue generated from direct sales.\nStrategic Business Updates\nDigital Entertainment\nGarena enjoyed healthy growth this quarter, buoyed by factors including the continued expansion of our leading mobile games in the region, Arena of Valor and Free Fire. Free Fire recently achieved 13 million daily active users, placing it amongst the world's most popular mobile battle royale titles. We continue to complement our leading franchises through growing e-sports leagues, video streaming options, and other ancillary services.\nWe held Garena World 2018, our region's largest eSports event, from March 31 to April 1, 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand. We had an attendance of approximately 240 thousand and attracted over 10.6 million views online for the various tournaments at Garena World. In total, over 11,000 teams participated in the tournaments leading up to the event in Bangkok. Garena is well-positioned to ride on the wave of eSports growth as one of the region's leading game platforms. We continue to invest in our eSports operations to generate user engagement for our games and to promote user acquisition and retention.\nOur pipeline of games for release in 2018 features a series of highly anticipated PC and mobile titles. These include both classic and new franchises in different genres.\nE-commerce\nShopee achieved robust growth in both GMV and gross orders in each of our markets in the first quarter of 2018 and saw a decrease in sales and marketing expenses from US$135.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to US$127.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. This was driven primarily by our continuous efforts to attract new buyers and sellers in our focus categories while improving our cost efficiency.\nShopee has focused much of its innovation on launching value-added services to our ever-expanding seller base. We continue to broaden our 'Service by Shopee' offering in select markets, where we offer sellers a number of value-added services, such as inventory management, online store operations, and fulfilment services. We also provide 'Shopee Logistics Service' to create a seamless logistics experience for sellers and buyers. In addition, we conduct direct sales of certain products. With this diverse portfolio of services and offerings, depending on the needs and preferences of our sellers, we can help them manage inventory and fulfil orders from warehouses leased and operated by us, operate their stores on our platform, or purchase products from them for resale on our platform.\nOther Development\nAppointment of Group Chief Economist\nThe Company also announced that Santitarn Sathirathai is expected to join the Company as Group Chief Economist in June 2018. Mr. Sathirathai will focus on establishing Sea as a key thought leader in the digital economy and work with policy makers to promote digital transformation in the region. He will report to Forrest Li, Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Sathirathai will be joining the Company from Credit Suisse, where he is the head of Emerging Asia Economics Research. He won the award for best economic forecaster for Indonesia by Consensus Economics for each of 2013, 2014 and 2015, the very first economist in Asia to receive such award for three consecutive years, and was selected as one of Asia's 21 young leaders in 2017 by Asia Society. He is a highly ranked economist for ASEAN and was also rated the best economist for Thailand by Asia Money. Prior to joining Credit Suisse, Mr. Sathirathai worked at the Ministry of Finance of Thailand and Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and taught macroeconomic courses at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand. Mr. Sathirathai holds a doctorate degree in Public Policy and a master's degree in Public Administration from Harvard University, as well as a bachelor's degree in Economics and a master's degree in Public Policy from the London School of Economics and Political Science.\nSummary of Financial Results\n(Amounts are expressed in thousands of US dollars \"$\")\nFor the Three Months\nended March 31,\n2017\n2018\n$\n$\nYOY%\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nRevenue\nDigital Entertainment\n87,586\n110,658\n26.3%\nOthers\n6,359\n44,386\n598.0%\n93,945\n155,044\n65.0%\nCost of revenue\nDigital Entertainment\n(49,277)\n(63,572)\n29.0%\nOthers\n(17,561)\n(82,947)\n372.3%\n(66,838)\n(146,519)\n119.2%\nGross profit\n27,107\n8,525\n(68.6)%\nOther operating income\n218\n729\n234.4%\nSales and marketing expenses\n(63,898)\n(152,149)\n138.1%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(25,208)\n(44,487)\n76.5%\nResearch and development expenses\n(6,252)\n(10,712)\n71.3%\nTotal operating expenses\n(95,140)\n(206,619)\n117.2%\nOperating loss\n(68,033)\n(198,094)\n191.2%\nNon-operating loss, net\n(2,479)\n(18,247)\n636.1%\nIncome tax (expense) credit\n(1,932)\n755\n(139.1)%\nShare of results of equity investees\n(632)\n(583)\n(7.8)%\nNet loss\n(73,076)\n(216,169)\n195.8%\nAdjusted net loss (1)\n(66,963)\n(205,498)\n206.9%\nAdjusted revenue of Digital Entertainment (1)\n102,396\n146,030\n42.6%\nAdjusted revenue of E-commerce (1)\n34\n33,744\n99,147.1%\nAdjusted revenue of Digital Financial Services (1)\n2,034\n3,923\n92.9%\nRevenue of Other Services\n4,291\n13,342\n210.9%\nTotal adjusted revenue (1)\n108,755\n197,039\n81.2%\nAdjusted EBITDA for Digital Entertainment (1)\n37,006\n55,004\n48.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA for E-commerce (1)\n(62,669)\n(179,649)\n(186.7)%\nAdjusted EBITDA for Digital Financial Services (1)\n(9,904)\n(8,570)\n13.5%\nAdjusted EBITDA for Other Services (1)\n(2,923)\n(9,868)\n(237.6)%\nUnallocated expenses (2)\n(2,867)\n(1,591)\n44.5%\nTotal adjusted EBITDA (1)\n(41,357)\n(144,674)\n(249.8)%\n(1) For a discussion of the use of non-GAAP financial measures, see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n(2) Unallocated expenses are mainly related to share-based compensation and general and corporate administrative\ncosts such as professional fees and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to segments.

Our total adjusted revenue increased by 81.2% to US$197.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$108.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. These increases were mainly driven by the growth in each of the segments detailed as follows:\nDigital Entertainment: Revenue increased by 26.3% to US$110.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$87.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted revenue increased by 42.6% to US$146.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$102.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our QAUs to 126.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from 56.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, as we launched new games and expanded our existing games into new markets, which in turn increased the number of our paying users. E-commerce: We began monetizing our e-commerce business in 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, our e-commerce revenue was US$27.3 million, including US$15.6 million of marketplace revenue and US$11.7 million of product revenue. Our e-commerce adjusted revenue was US$33.7 million in the same period. There was negligible e-commerce revenue for the first quarter of 2017. The additional services and product offerings we introduced to sellers under 'Service by Shopee,' 'Shopee Logistics Service,' as well as the other value-added services we recently started to offer created additional income streams for our e-commerce business. Digital Financial Services: Revenue increased by 81.9% to US$3.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$2.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted revenue increased by 92.9% to US$3.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$2.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of use cases to our AirPay platform and a further deepening of our market penetration. Other Services: Revenue increased by 210.9% to US$13.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$4.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to ancillary services we provide to our e-commerce platform users.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue increased by 119.2% to US$146.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$66.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nDigital Entertainment: Cost of revenue increased by 29.0% to US$63.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$49.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in royalty payments to game developers as well as other costs directly associated with our digital entertainment segment which were largely in line with the revenue growth of our business. Others: Cost of revenue for our other segments combined increased by 372.3% to US$82.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$17.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the costs incurred following the launch of 'Service by Shopee,' 'Shopee Logistics Service,' and direct sales at the end of 2017; higher bank transaction fees driven by GMV growth from our e-commerce business; higher costs associated with other ancillary services we provided to our e-commerce platform users; as well as higher staff compensation and benefit costs.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur total sales and marketing expenses increased by 138.1% to US$152.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$63.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The table below sets forth the breakdown of the sales and marketing expenses of our two major reporting segments.

The increase in marketing efforts was aligned with our strategy to fully capture the market growth opportunity and was primarily in connection with shipping and other promotions on our platform in order to increase our user base and enhance user engagement.\nFor the Three Months\nended March 31,\n2017\n2018\nE-commerce\n$\n(unaudited)\n$\n(unaudited)\nSales and marketing expenses\n45,905\n127,198\nGMV\n648,285\n1,941,403\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of GMV\n7.1%\n6.6%\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of GMV was 6.6% in the first quarter of 2018 and improved from 7.1% in the first quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by 76.5% to US$44.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$25.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the expansion of our staff force, the increase in office facilities and related expenses, as well as the increase in other expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses increased by 71.3% to US$10.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from US$6.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the increase in research and development staff force as we expanded and enriched our product offerings.\nNon-operating Income or Losses, Net\nNon-operating income or losses consist of interest income, interest expense, investment gain (loss), fair value change for convertible promissory notes and foreign exchange gain (loss). We recorded a net non-operating loss of US$18.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net non-operating loss of US$2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. This was primarily due to fair value loss of US$18.8 million recognized in the quarter arising from the fair value accounting treatment for convertible promissory notes and interest expenses on those promissory notes, partially offset by an investment gain arising from the disposal of an equity security investment.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had a net income tax benefit of US$0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 which was primarily due to the higher deferred tax assets we recognized as a result of change in statutory tax rate in one of the markets we operate in and the increase in deferred revenue in our digital entertainment segment in the first quarter of 2018.\nShare of Results of Equity Investees\nWe had share of losses of equity investees of US$0.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with US$0.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had net losses of US$216.2 million and US$73.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Loss\nAdjusted net loss, which is net loss adjusted to remove share-based compensation expenses, was US$205.5 million and US$67.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nUpdated Guidance\nFor the full year of 2018, we now expect total adjusted revenue to be between US$780 million and US$820 million, representing 40.9% to 48.1% growth from 2017. This compares to the previously disclosed guidance of between US$730 million and US$770 million, representing 31.9% to 39.1% growth.\nWe are also revising our e-commerce GMV guidance for the full year of 2018. We now expect e-commerce GMV for the full year of 2018 to be between US$8.2 billion and US$8.7 billion, representing 99.4% to 111.5% growth from 2017. This compares to the previously disclosed guidance of between US$7.5 billion and US$8.0 billion, representing 82.4% to 94.5% growth.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMr. Forrest Li, Founder, Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Tony Hou, Group Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Alan Hellawell, Group Chief Strategy Officer, will host a conference call today to review Sea's business and financial performance.\nDetails of the conference call and webcast are as follows:\nDate and time:\n8:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time on 15 May 2018\n8:00 AM Singapore / Hong Kong Time on 16 May 2018\nWebcast link:\nhttp://mms.prnasia.com/se/20180515/default.aspx\nDial in numbers:\nUS Toll Free: 1-888-317-6003\nHong Kong: 800-963-976\nInternational: 1-412-317-6061\nSingapore: 800-120-5863\nUnited Kingdom: 08-082-389-063\nPasscode for participants: 7961550\nA replay of the conference call will be available at the Company's investor relations website ( http://www.seagroup.com/investor/financials ).

This financial measure is used as an approximation of cash spent by our users in the applicable period that is attributable to our digital entertainment segment. Although other companies may present such measures related to gross billings differently or not at all, we believe that the adjusted revenue of our digital entertainment segment provides useful information to investors about the segment's core operating results, enhancing their understanding of our past performance and future prospects. \"Adjusted revenue\" of our e-commerce segment represents revenue of the e-commerce segment (currently consisting of marketplace revenue and product revenue) plus commission income that were net-off against sales incentives. This financial measure enables our investors to follow trends in our e-commerce monetization capability over time and is a useful performance measure. \"Adjusted revenue\" of our digital financial services segment represents revenue of the digital financial services segment plus service revenue that were net-off against sales incentives. \"Total adjusted revenue\" represents the sum of the adjusted revenue of our digital entertainment segment, the adjusted revenue of our e-commerce segment, the adjusted revenue of our digital financial services segment, and the revenue of our other services. This financial measure enables our investors to follow trends in our overall group monetization capability over time and is a useful performance measure. \"Adjusted net loss\" represents net loss excluding share-based compensation expense. We believe that the adjusted net loss helps to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that are included in net loss. The use of adjusted net loss has its limitations in that it does not include all items that impact the net loss or income for the period, and share-based compensation is a recurring significant expense. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" for our digital entertainment segment represents operating income (loss) before share-based compensation plus (a) depreciation and amortization expenses, and (b) the net effect of changes in deferred revenue and its related cost for our digital entertainment segment. Although other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not present it at all, we believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future prospects. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" for our e-commerce segment, digital financial services segment and other services segment represents operating income (loss) before share-based compensation plus depreciation and amortization expenses. Although other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not present it at all, we believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future prospects. \"Total adjusted EBITDA\" represents the sum of adjusted EBITDA of all our segments combined, plus unallocated expenses. Although other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not present it at all, we believe that the total adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future prospects.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. None of the above financial measures should be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to revenue, net loss/income, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to Sea's data. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP financial measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nThe tables below present selected financial information of our reporting segments, the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures, and the related reconciliations between the financial measures .
