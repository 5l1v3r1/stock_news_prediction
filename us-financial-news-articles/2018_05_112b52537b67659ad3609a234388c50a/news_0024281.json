After Lauer retired Jose Martinez on a fly to right, Ozuna pulled a 371-foot homer into the left field corner.\nThen Gyorko struck with a 410-foot drive into the second deck in left. It was the infielder’s eighth homer against his original team. He went 3-for-5 Friday night and is now 21-for-42 as a Cardinal against the Padres.\nDeJong got his career-high fourth RBI in the fifth with a run-scoring single against Bryan Mitchell, who was making his first appearance out of the Padres bullpen after losing his spot in the rotation. Tommy Pham made it 9-0 in the sixth with a two-run homer off Mitchell.\nLauer (1-2) allowed six runs on seven hits (including the four home runs) and a walk in 2 1/3 innings. Mitchell allowed three runs on six hits and three walks over 5 2/3 innings.\nThe Padres scored five times against the Cardinals bullpen on run-scoring doubles by A.J. Ellis and Jose Pirela (his first extra-base hit since April 15), a triple by Franchy Cordero and Travis Jankowski’s first homer of the season leading off the ninth. St. Louis reliever Luke Gregerson also balked in a run in the final frame.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-12T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:10:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
