Each bale contains 170 kg of cotton.\nIndia shipped 5.82 million bales of cotton overseas last marketing year, according to data compiled by the state-run textile commissioner’s office.\nICE cotton futures hit four-year highs earlier this week on buying from Chinese hedge funds, amid expectations of an increase in exports from the United States after trade war fears with China receded.\nThe Indian rupee has fallen more than 6 percent in 2018, making Indian cotton cheaper for overseas buyers, said Nayan Mirani, partner at leading cotton exporter Khimji Visram & Sons.\n“There is export demand but supply of good quality cotton is limited as the season is coming to an end,” he said.\nPakistan, Bangladesh, China and Vietnam are the main buyers of Indian fibre.\nIndian cotton is being offered around 84 to 86 cents per lb on a cost and freight basis (C&F) to buyers in Bangladesh and Vietnam, compared to over 92 cents from the United Sates and Brazil, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media.\nMeanwhile, the country’s cotton imports could drop to 1.2 million bales in 2017/18 from 3 million bales the year before, said Ganatra at CAI.\nThe South Asian country usually imports long staple cotton from the United States and Egypt.\nAnd a pick-up in local consumption amid higher exports is likely to erode India’s cotton stockpile, Mirani said.\nIndia’s cotton consumption is likely to rise 5.3 percent in 2017/18 from the year before to 32.4 million bales, CAI estimates.\nThe country could end the 2017/18 season with closing stocks of less than 2 million tonnes, the lowest in decades, Ganatra estimates.
