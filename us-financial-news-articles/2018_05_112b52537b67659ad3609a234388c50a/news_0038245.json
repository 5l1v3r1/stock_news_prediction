Why different types of 5G matter\nThe J.P. Morgan analysts said that investors were not only worried too soon about 5G expenses, but that they also needed to differentiate between two versions of the technology in development.\n\"The potential impact is significantly different,\" they said.\nThe first version, known as non-standalone 5G, refers to instances where the technology is built into existing networks, with necessary upgrades. That is similar to how firms run current 4G servicesalongside their older networks. \"Mass market adoption for the major identifiable use case for 5G is still [more than] 10 years away.\" -James Sullivan, head of Asia ex-Japan equity research, JP Morgan\nIn other words, companies could offer non-standalone 5G service without having to invest heavily, since much of the infrastructure already exists.\nStandalone 5G, on the other hand, is the idea of a fifth generation network that is built from scratch and does not piggyback on existing infrastructure, according to Sullivan. That sort of network would require higher capital investments.\n\"Non-standalone 5G cannot handle the technical requirements that are devoted to 5G,\" Sullivan said.\nThere is no clearly defined business case for standalone 5G yet, he explained. The main advantage of that approach is that it could allow multiple machines to communicate with one another with minimal interruptions — in some cases, such as autonomous driving, uninterrupted communication between computers is crucial.\n\"The major envisioned use cases are still many years away, such as autonomous cars and industrial applications,\" Sullivan added. \"Mass market adoption for the major identifiable use case for 5G is still [more than] 10 years away.\" Risks and benefits\nThe investment bank said its analysis shows that within Asia, Japanese and Chinese telcos stand to benefit the most from non-standalone 5G networks. That's because they would be able to offer 5G services to users by tapping into existing infrastructure, thereby reducing costs.\n\"We expect incremental equipment costs to be minimal, as much of the cost would be incurred in 4G network upgrades anyway,\" Sullivan said.\nThe bank's analysis said telcom stocks in those two markets were trading below what they're worth, suggesting that risks associated with 5G investments were priced in.\nThe analysts said they were more cautious on the sector in Hong Kong , Singapore and Taiwan because their analysis showed that risks were not yet fully priced in.\nSullivan told CNBC that building standalone 5G network requires more spending, so the risks associated with them are greater than the risks associated with non-standalone networks.
