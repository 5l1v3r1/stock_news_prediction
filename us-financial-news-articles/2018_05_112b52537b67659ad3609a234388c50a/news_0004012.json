The airline's publicity suffered another blow in March when a small French bulldog puppy, Kokito, died onboard one of its flights after an airline employee forced the dog's owner to stow its carrying case in the plane's overhead bin.\n\"Josh is a proven leader and world-class communications strategist who has thrived when the stakes are the highest - and the margin for error is the smallest,\" Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement.\nPrior to joining United, Earnest served as press secretary for President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016. He has since worked as a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.\nEarnest will begin his role at United on May 21.
