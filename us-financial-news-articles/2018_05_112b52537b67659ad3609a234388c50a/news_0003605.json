(TSX:GCL) (“Colabor” or the “Corporation”) today reported its results for the first quarter ended March 24, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nSales of $245.9 million compared with $267.2 million during the equivalent period of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of ($1.2) million compared with $0.9 million during the equivalent period of 2017 Further improvement in the profitability of the Décarie division Net earnings of ($4.5) million or ($0.04) per share, compared to ($3.4) million or ($0.03) per share during the equivalent period of 2017 Total debt reduced to $114.9 million, from $124.9 million during the equivalent period of 2017 Appointment of Lionel Ettedgui as President and Chief Executive Officer\nFinancial highlights Quarter ended (thousands of dollars except per-share data) March 24, 2018 March 25, 2017 (84 days) (84 days) Sales 245,890 267,187 Adjusted EBITDA 1 (1,202 ) 900 Charges not related to current operations - 869 Net earnings (loss) (4,480 ) (3,446) Per share – basic and diluted ($) (0.04 ) (0.03) Cash flow from operating activities 2 (642 ) (4,534) Total debt 114,868 124,915 Weighted average number of shares outstanding\n(basic, in thousands) 3 101,306 102,074 1 Non-IFRS measure. Refer to the table of reconciliation of Net Earnings to Adjusted EBITDA. 2 After the net change in working capital. 3 The Company announced, on January 15, 2018, that it had reduced by less than 1% the number of shares issued and outstanding following the ongoing liquidation and dissolution of Colabor Investments Inc. Lionel Ettedgui, President and Chief Executive Officer of Colabor, said: “Our first quarter results for 2018 continue to be marked by the anticipated loss of sales volume primarily at the Ontario Division, after several measures implemented in 2017 to mitigate this effect. The entire team is working diligently to improve the operating performance.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nConsolidated sales for the 84-day period ended March 24, 2018 stood at $245.9 million, down from $267.2 million for the 84-day period ended March 25, 2017, representing a sales decrease of 8.0%.\nSales of the Distribution segment decreased by 6.6% to $190.9 million compared with $204.5 million during the first quarter of 2017. This reduction comes mainly from the Ontario division following the loss of the supply agreement for the Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen restaurant chain (in November 2017), the effect of which was slightly mitigated by an improvement of sales primarily at the CFD division.\nSales of the Wholesale segment stood at $55.0 million, down 12.3% from $62.7 million during the equivalent quarter of the previous year, from the reduction of sales volume at the Boucherville division. Although the Décarie division also experienced lower sales, the decline was less significant than experienced during the equivalent quarter of last year, following measures put in place by its new leader.\nAdjusted EBITDA was ($1.2) million or (0.5)% of sales, compared to $0.9 million or 0.3% of sales in the equivalent quarter of 2017, resulting mainly from the loss of volume in Ontario and inefficiencies at this division.\nColabor concluded the first quarter of 2018 with net earnings of ($4.5) million, or ($0.04) per share, compared to net earnings of ($3.4) million, or ($0.03) per share in the equivalent quarter of 2017. This variation stems from the effect of the loss of sales volume on the operational result, partially mitigated by the reduction of costs not related to current operations in the first quarter of 2018.\nCash Flow and Financial Position\nCash flow from operating activities reached ($0.6) million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to ($4.5) million for the equivalent quarter of 2017. This is explained by a net working capital improvement compared with the equivalent quarter of last year, when clients and other receivables and inventories were higher.\nAs at March 24, 2018, the Company’s total debt including the convertible debentures and bank overdraft amounted to $114.9 million, down from $124.9 million during the equivalent period of last year.\nOutlook\n“As anticipated and discussed during our most recent financial results, the measures put in place to mitigate the effect of the loss of volume on operating margins in the Ontario division will take effect later than planned in 2018. To mitigate the impact, including from the loss of the supply agreement for the Montana’s BBQ and Bar restaurant banner effective April 1, 2018, we will continue to grow our presence in value-added niche markets and are working to identify opportunities which could allow us to improve our operational performance,” added Mr. Ettedgui.\nConference Call and Annual Meeting of Shareholders\nColabor will hold a conference call to discuss these results on Thursday, May 3, 2018, beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
