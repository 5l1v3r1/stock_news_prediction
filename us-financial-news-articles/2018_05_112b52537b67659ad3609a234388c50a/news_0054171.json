Videos of the tragedy taken by passers-by and locals, plus their testimony had helped investigators locate the second recorder.\nBoth, known as the “black box,” are crucial to explaining what went wrong with the 39-year-old plane which dived into fields south of Havana shortly after takeoff, bursting into flames.\nThe Boeing 737, leased by the little-known Mexican company Damojh to Cuba’s flagship carrier Cubana, had been destined for the eastern city of Holguin and 100 of the victims were Cuban.\nSeven Mexicans, two Argentines and two Sahrawis from a disputed area in the Western Sahara known as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic also died in the tragedy.\nCuba is leading the probe into the crash, one of the Caribbean island’s worst ever, together with Mexican and U.S. investigators.\nOnly two Cuban women have survived but are in a critical condition due to burns and other trauma, the director of the hospital where they are being attended has said.\nMexico’s civil aviation authority said on Monday it had suspended Damojh’s operations while it made sure the firm adhered to regulations and gathered information to help investigators find the cause of the crash.\nPrevious complaints over inadequate maintenance and safety measures have surfaced in recent days.\nReporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T03:49:37.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
