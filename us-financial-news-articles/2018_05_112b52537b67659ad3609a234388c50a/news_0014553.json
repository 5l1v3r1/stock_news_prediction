And the jury that will award the Palme d’Or is this year headed by a woman, Australian actress Cate Blanchett, and is majority-female.\nBut Blanchett said the increased awareness of women’s issues would have “no direct impact” on who wins.\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that of the 21 films in the main competition, there were only three directed by women, Blanchett told a news conference:\n“A few years ago there were only two!”\n Opening ceremony and screening of the film \"Everybody Knows\" (Todos lo saben) in competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France, May 8, 2018 - cast members Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem arrive.
