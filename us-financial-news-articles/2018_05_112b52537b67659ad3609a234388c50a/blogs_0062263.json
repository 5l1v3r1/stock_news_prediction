It (the list) reads like a script from a comedy parody, but it's true.\"\nHowever, Mackenzie remained optimistic that a more gender-equal future was becoming more likely.\n\"We have plenty of reasons to be optimistic — the combination of gender pay gap reporting and the increased focus on equality and diversity in general by responsible businesses means there are more women on boards than ever before,\" she said.\n\"While we still have a long way to go, with the collaboration between government, employers and their employees (both men and women), we could see true equality in our lifetime.\"\nSigns of improvement were highlighted in a report published in March that showed that almost 29 percent of FTSE 100 board positions are now held by women, up from 12.5 percent in 2011. The same report revealed that the number for women on FTSE 350 boards had risen to 25.2 percent.\nshow chapters 6 ways to convince someone the gender pay gap is real 4:45 PM ET Tue, 10 April 2018 | 03:20 This year, the U.K. government enforced businesses with over 250 workers to publish gender pay gap figures by the beginning of April . Many companies reported a gender pay disparity and attributed it to not having enough women in senior roles , but that they would commit to increasing opportunities for women.\n\"Around a third of FTSE 350 companies still have very few women either on their boards or in senior leadership roles. We used to hear these excuses regularly a few years ago, thankfully much less so now,\" Sir Philip Hampton, chair of the Hampton-Alexander Review, said in a statement.\n\"However, leaders expressing warm words of support but actually doing very little to appoint women into top jobs — or quietly blocking progress — are really not much better.\"\nLike this story?
