The expansion of business with the largest personal health care and cosmetic retailer in China and the acquisition of the Manilla, Philippines IT business are two recent examples of our ongoing efforts to expand our IT business.

We understand that this challenge requires better profit margins from core IT business as well as finding newer, higher profit margin IT products and services. Compared to the financial condition of the Company prior to 2016, we believe we have made significant strides in establishing a sustainable IT business, but we also understand and seek to address the challenges of our company to achieve and sustain better net income in the highly competitive IT business in our markets, especially with many larger competitors.”\nBusiness Outlook\nMr. Tan said, “We are encouraged by revenue growth in 1 st quarter of 2018.
