I feel like I’ve played it,” said Kang, who won her first major last year at the Women’s PGA Championship.\n“He’s helped me out on what pins to attack and what to be conservative on,” Kang said. “And also which parts of the course to be avoided at all costs.”\nWhether preferred lies should be allowed has been a hot topic among players the past two days.\nCristie Kerr, the 2007 champion, said that it would be a “joke” if players were not given the chance to clean mud from their balls.\nAustralian Karrie Webb was a little more diplomatic.\n“I will say that it will be the softest U.S. Open I’ve ever played,” said the 2000 and 2001 champion.\n“I’m mentally preparing that we might play it down (no preferred lies).”\nEight-times PGA Tour winner Brad Faxon weighed in on the side of preferred lies, pointing out that the tradition of playing the ball as it lies at major championships was broken in the final round at the 2016 PGA Championship at Baltusrol.\n“I wouldn’t have a problem at all (with preferred lies),” Faxon, here as a television analyst for Fox Sports, told Reuters.\n“It’s something the USGA has never done and they don’t want to start now.\n“If they play one or two rounds with the ball up, I don’t think that takes away (from the stature of the championship).\n“We just did some stuff out on the golf course and there seems to be casual water every step you take.\n“I don’t know how you can play a fair golf tournament, because I know mud affects the players’ shots. If it’s consistently muddy, it’s a big issue.” (Reporting by Andrew Both, editing by Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T02:05:11.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
