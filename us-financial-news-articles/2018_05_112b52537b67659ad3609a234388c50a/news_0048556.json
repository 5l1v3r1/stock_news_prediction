The broader Topix slipped 0.23 percent, with most of its 33 subsectors finishing insurers led losses.\nSeveral index heavyweights, however, clung to gains, with Fanuc higher by 0.88 percent and Fast Retailing rising 0.55 percent by the end of the day.\nMarkets over in China, however, closed in positive territory after getting a boost late in the session. The Shanghai composite was little changed, up 0.02 percent at 3,214.53 and the Shenzhen Composite tacked on 0.38 percent to end at 1,855.16.\nSymbol Name Price Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Elsewhere, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.7 percent to 6,041.90 amid broad-based losses in most sectors.

Mnuchin's Sunday comment that a trade war between the countries was \"on hold\" had cheered global markets on Monday.\nDespite the broader sense of calm in markets now that trade tensions between the world's two largest economies had eased, some still expected the better outlook to be subject to change.\nThe U.S. \"could easily come back with accusations of insufficient change at a moment's notice, probably at a time when it suited them, the mid-term election in November for example,\" Robert Carnell, chief economist of ING, said in a note.\nThe mixed session in the region also came on the back of U.S. stocks closing higher , with the Dow Jones industrial average finishing the session above the 25,000 mark for the first time since mid-March.\nOn the commodities front, oil prices were slightly higher after touching their highest levels in three and a half years overnight. Markets were concerned over U.S. sanctions targeting Venezuela following the latter's recent election , the results of which were widely condemned.\nU.S. crude futures edged up 0.36 percent to $72.50 per barrel and Brent crude futures added 0.19 percent to trade at $79.37.\nThe dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of peers, traded at 93.620. Against the yen, the dollar firmed to trade at 111.07 at 2:38 p.m. HK/SIN, compared to levels around the 110 handle seen last week.\nThe euro, which earlier got some reprieve after taking a hit on recent uncertainty in Italian politics, slipped to trade at $1.1762.\nIn corporate news, Sony said it had reached an agreement to acquire Mubadala Investment's stake in EMI Music Publishing for $1.9 billion.
