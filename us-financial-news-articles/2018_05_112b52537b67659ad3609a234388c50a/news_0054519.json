We are at the mercy of the (Trump) administration, not just on North Korea but on trade with the auto tariffs being announced,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, New York.\n“Sure, the summit was seen as a positive and it being called off is, I suppose, a negative. But I think the weakness in the market is broader.”\nAt 11:33 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 189.15 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,697.66, the S&P 500 was down 14.51 points, or 0.53 percent, at 2,718.78 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 32.54 points, or 0.44 percent, at 7,393.42.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the red, led by the energy sector’s 1.8 percent tumble.\nOil prices recorded their largest one-day drop in two weeks, with expectations building that OPEC could wind down an output deal due to concerns about supplies from Venezuela and Iran.\nFinancial stocks dropped 1.1 percent after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting tempered expectations of faster interest rate hikes.\nThe technology sector’s 0.7 percent decline weighed the most.\nFord was up 1.7 percent and General Motors gained 1.1 percent on the possibility of tariffs on European and Asian car imports. U.S.-listed shares of Fiat fell 1.8 percent.\nBest Buy Co tumbled 8.2 percent, the most on the S&P, after the consumer electronics retailer reported a slowdown in quarterly online sales and did not update its full-year financial outlook.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.58-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 59 new highs and 34 new lows.
