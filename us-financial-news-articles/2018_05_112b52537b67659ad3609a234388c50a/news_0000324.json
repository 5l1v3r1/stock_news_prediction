REUTERS/Pavel Rebrov/File Photo\nThe companies involved are alleged to have supplied machines, machine parts and other services for the construction of the 19 kilometre long bridge spanning the Strait of Kerch, the prosecutor’s office said.\nThis represented a violation of sanctions imposed by the European Union after the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in 2014, the prosecutors said, as they explicitly ruled out the sale of machines and related services for use in Crimea.\n“This is a serious offence, undermining the EU sanction regime”, the prosecutors said in a statement.
