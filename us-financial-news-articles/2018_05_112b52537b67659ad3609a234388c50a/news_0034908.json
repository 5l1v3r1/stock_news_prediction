MSCI will announce in June whether it will upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market status.\n“We expect banks and petrochemicals to lead market movement over the next few weeks, although activity will usually be lower during Ramadan,” he added. The holy month of Ramadan will start this week.\nSaudi British Bank (SABB) and Alawwal Bank asked the bourse to suspend trading in their shares pending an announcement. They have been conducting merger talks.\nThe Dubai index was up 0.7 percent as heavyweight Emaar Properties rose 1.8 percent, rebounding for a second day from a two-year low.\nIts affiliate Emaar Development gained 1.8 percent after MSCI decided overnight to add the stock to its United Arab Emirates index at the end of this month; the decision had been widely expected.\nBuilder Drake & Scull jumped 6.1 percent after reporting it swung to a small first-quarter net profit from a huge year-earlier loss.\nBut DAMAC Properties fell 5.6 percent after posting a 45 percent drop in first-quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates.\nIn Abu Dhabi, the index rose 0.7 percent, backed mainly by heavyweight First Gulf Bank, which rose 1.3 percent. Aldar Properties added 0.5 percent after the largest developer in Abu Dhabi reported a 5 percent rise in quarterly profit, beating estimates.\nQatar’s index rose 0.3 percent on a 3.8 percent gain by Qatar National Bank and a 2.2 percent increase by Qatar Islamic Bank. MSCI said it would raise their weightings after the companies increased their foreign ownership ceilings.\nQatar Gas Transport tumbled 5.9 percent after MSCI downgraded the stock to its small cap index; Arqaam Capital estimated there was only a 10 percent chance of that happening.
