It also said in its report that it was concerned over Folli’s finances.\nThe Greek securities regulator said there would be a clear timetable for the conclusion of the audit and that it would also ask QCM to come up with an “analytical explanation of its arguments” and submit the relevant data.\nThe securities watchdog is also probing transactions on Folli shares, including short sales, since last Friday, it said.\nReporting by George Georgiopoulos, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:45:06.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
