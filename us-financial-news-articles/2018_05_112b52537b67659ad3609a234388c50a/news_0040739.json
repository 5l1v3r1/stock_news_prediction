The Company adopted the standard using the full retrospective method, and the condensed consolidated statements of income, balance sheets and statements of cash flows for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017 have been recast. The impact of the adoption on the condensed consolidated statements of income for both the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017 was immaterial. The condensed consolidated balance sheets reflect the impact of recording the allowance for sales returns on a gross basis rather than as a net liability. The return asset totaled $11.7 million and $11.6 million at May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively, and the allowance for sales returns totaled $20.0 million at May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017.\nPension Presentation\nAdditionally during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company retrospectively adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The impact of the adoption for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017 was a reclass of $1.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, from selling, general and administrative expenses to other expense for the non-service component of net periodic benefit costs.\nThere is no impact to net earnings or earnings per share as a result of the adoption of these standards for the periods presented.\nDillard’s, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited) (In Millions, Except Per Share Data) 13 Weeks Ended May 5, 2018 April 29, 2017 Amount % of\nNet\nSales\nAmount % of\nNet\nSales\nNet sales $ 1,456.3 100.0 % $ 1,418.2 100.0 % Service charges and other income 34.4 2.4 34.6 2.4 1,490.7 102.4 1,452.8 102.4 Cost of sales 903.0 62.0 870.0 61.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 406.0 27.9 396.6 28.0 Depreciation and amortization 56.0 3.8 60.0 4.2 Rentals 6.5 0.4 6.2 0.4 Interest and debt expense, net 14.0 1.0 15.7 1.1 Other expense 1.9 0.1 1.8 0.1 Loss on disposal of assets 0.1 0.0 — 0.0 Income before income taxes 103.2 7.1 102.5 7.2 Income taxes 22.7 36.2 Net income $ 80.5 5.5 % $ 66.3 4.7 % Basic and diluted earnings per share $ 2.89 $ 2.12 Basic and diluted weighted average shares 27.8 31.3 Dillard’s, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) (In Millions) May 5, 2018 April 29, 2017 Assets Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 164.1 $ 301.5 Restricted cash 1.9 — Accounts receivable 43.5 40.4 Merchandise inventories 1,780.8 1,713.9 Other current assets 55.1 48.6 Total current assets 2,045.4 2,104.4 Property and equipment, net 1,662.9 1,764.5 Other assets 73.2\n257.6 Total Assets $ 3,781.5 $ 4,126.5 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current Liabilities: Trade accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 1,052.3 $ 1,069.9 Current portion of long-term debt and capital leases 162.1 90.5 Federal and state income taxes 63.9 86.9 Total current liabilities 1,278.3 1,247.3 Long-term debt and capital leases 368.0 529.9 Other liabilities 240.5 238.3 Deferred income taxes 12.6 220.6 Subordinated debentures 200.0 200.0 Stockholders' equity 1,682.1 1,690.4 Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity $ 3,781.5 $ 4,126.5 Dillard’s, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited) (In Millions) 13 Weeks Ended May 5, 2018 April 29, 2017 Operating activities: Net income $ 80.5 $ 66.3 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization of property and other deferred cost 56.5 60.6 Loss on disposal of assets 0.1 — Changes in operating assets and liabilities: (Increase) decrease in accounts receivable (5.1 ) 6.9 Increase in merchandise inventories (317.2 ) (307.5 ) Increase in other current assets (4.7 ) (1.1 ) (Increase) decrease in other assets (1.4 ) 1.4 Increase in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 224.4 215.7 Increase in income taxes payable 22.3 35.1 Net cash provided by operating activities 55.4 77.4 Investing activities: Purchase of property and equipment (39.2 ) (34.5 ) Proceeds from disposal of assets 1.9 — Proceeds from insurance — 1.9 Distribution from joint venture 0.8 0.3 Net cash used in investing activities (36.5 ) (32.3 ) Financing activities: Principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations (0.3 ) (0.2 ) Cash dividends paid (2.8 ) (2.3 ) Purchase of treasury stock (36.8 ) (88.1 ) Net cash used in financing activities (39.9 ) (90.6 ) Decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (21.0 ) (45.5 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 187.0 347.0 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period $ 166.0 $ 301.5 Non-cash transactions: Accrued capital expenditures $ 8.1 $ 3.2 Accrued purchases of treasury stock — 3.0 Estimates for 2018\nThe Company is providing the following estimates for certain financial statement items for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2019 based upon current conditions.
