Condola Rashad in “Saint Joan,” Lauren Ridloff in “Children of a Lesser God” and Amy Schumer in “Meteor Shower” were the other nominees for best actress in a play.\n“Coming back to Broadway is like coming home again,” Washington said after his nomination. “‘The Iceman Cometh’ experience has been especially gratifying,” the past Tony and Oscar winner added, citing, “our sensational director George C. Wolfe and my 18 wonderful castmates.”\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows The Palace Theatre where the Harry Potter and The Cursed Child parts One and Two play is being staged, in London, Britain July 30, 2016.
