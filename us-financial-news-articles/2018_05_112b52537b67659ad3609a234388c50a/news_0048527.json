Shields allowed two runs on five hits in seven innings while striking out five and walking two, keeping the White Sox in the game until they could break through.\nRondon (2-2) tossed one scoreless inning with two strikeouts. Nate Jones allowed a walk and a hit in the ninth but fanned two while earning his fourth save of the year.\nChicago racked up 13 hits, with Orioles starter Kevin Gausman hurling 6 1/3 innings of shutout baseball despite allowing nine hits. He struck out 10 and walked one.\nGausman was anything but dominant, working through two-on jams in the first, second, fifth and sixth innings. He only had one inning of three-up, three-down pitching, and he was lifted in favor of Mychal Givens after surrendering a one-out single in the seventh.\nGivens (0-1) took the loss for Baltimore after allowing three runs on three hits in his lone inning.\nThe Orioles took a 2-0 lead in the second inning. Mark Trumbo doubled to left field to plate Jonathan Schoop, and Jace Peterson followed with a groundout that drove home Pedro Alvarez from third base.\nThose runs were enough to keep the Orioles in front until the eighth. Welington Castillo singled home Daniel Palka to get the White Sox on the board. Yoan Moncada followed with a sacrifice fly off Orioles reliever Richard Bleier to drive in Trayce Thompson to tie the game and set the table for Sanchez’s heroics.\nThe series will continue Wednesday with right-hander Alex Cobb (1-5, 6.56 ERA) going to the mound for Baltimore to oppose Chicago right-hander Dylan Covey (0-1, 6.00).\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:13:22.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
