It will then assess whether an additional “headroom” is needed above the cost base to take into account uncertainties and risks.\nThe price cap is due to be lifted in 2020 but the government can extend its duration by 12 months on three occasions.\nThose wishing to participate in the consultation have until June 25 to reply.\nSome of Britain’s biggest energy companies have announced price increases this year, citing higher wholesale prices and the cost of government policies to support renewable energy generation.
