Thao is also the vice chairwoman at HCMC Development Bank.\nThe stake sale, to be conducted via a share auction, is to take place by end-July. If that date is missed, PetroVietnam Oil is looking to move the sale to November, pending approval from the Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the company, also known as PVOIL, said in a separate statement.\nThe Vietnamese government raised $184 million through the sale of a 20 percent stake in PVOIL in an initial public offering in January.\nPVOIL said the strategic investors will have to hold their stake for at least 10 years.\nIdemitsu Kosan already holds a 35.1 percent stake at Nghi Son Refinery and Petrochemical LLC, which owns a 200,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Thanh Hoa province.\nPVOIL reported a pretax profit of 238 billion dong ($10.5 million) on total revenue of 16.5 trillion dong in the first four months of this year, PetroVietnam said, without giving comparative figures.\nReporting by Khanh Vu; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:15:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
