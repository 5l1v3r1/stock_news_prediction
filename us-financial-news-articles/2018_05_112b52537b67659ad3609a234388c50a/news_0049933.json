Mills are usually willing to pay a premium of about $10-$15 a tonne for Australian wheat as it is typically seen as better quality.\nThose prices come as Australian farmers are forced to plant wheat crops in some of the driest soil in years after scorching weather parched fields.\n“It is very had to get back share once a market develops a taste for an alternative variety which is not just getting better in quality but is cheaper,” said a veteran grains trader in Singapore.\nNEARLY DOUBLE Indonesia, which is estimated to buy a record 12 million tonnes of wheat in 2018, is likely to take about half of that from Russia and Ukraine, the traders said. That would be almost double the roughly 3 million tonnes it bought from those countries last year and would make it Asia’s biggest importer of Black Sea wheat.\nOther importers recently buying Russian and Ukrainian cargoes are Malaysia, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, traders said.\nAsian wheat importers bought 12.6 million tonnes of Black Sea wheat in 2017, up from 10.6 million tonnes the year before, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon agricultural flows data.\n“Most modern mills can blend lower quality grains with higher quality and get the right end-product,” said a purchasing manager at one of Southeast Asia’s biggest flour mills.\nMeanwhile, Australian wheat production could drop further from a decade-low of 21.2 million tonnes last year, piling further upwards pressure on grain from the country.\n“The Official forecast for 2018/19 is 23.7 million tonnes of wheat, but looking at the dryness in April-May, we could be producing just about 20 million tonnes,” said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney.\nReporting by Naveen Thukral; Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:06:28.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
