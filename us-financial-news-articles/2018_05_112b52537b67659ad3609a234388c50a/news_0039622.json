These are annual exercises and we are very transparent about them,\" White said.\nMeanwhile, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that the administration was continuing to prepare for the June 12 summit in Singapore.

The exercise that was supposed to involve the B-52s was a separate endeavor.\n\"There was never any plan for B-52s to participate in exercise Max Thunder, and the exercise continues as scheduled without change,\" a Pentagon spokesman told CNBC.\nLisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described Pyongyang's reaction to the planned military exercises as a \"cover to express their dissatisfaction with a bunch of different issues.\"\n\"North Korea does normally take issue with military exercises, but these were announced several weeks ago, and even the South Koreans said that Kim Jong Un was willing to overlook the U.S. and South Korean exercises happening in the region,\" Collins said in a previous interview with CNBC .\nCollins also said she expects the reclusive leader from the North to attend the meeting with Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:10:24.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
