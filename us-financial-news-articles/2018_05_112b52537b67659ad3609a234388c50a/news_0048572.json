REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo\nHis decision is expected to be announced at a party event on Tuesday, according to the senior government official, who spoke anonymously because the news has not yet been made public.\nTemer and Meirelles have been polling in the low single digits ahead of the October election.\nWith his popularity at rock bottom, Temer had hinted in recent days that he might throw in the towel.\nOver the weekend, he said Brazil’s centrist parties needed to join behind one candidate if they were to win the presidential election and continue his pro-business policies and balance the federal budget.

REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/File Photo\nPressure had mounted on Temer to hand the mantle to Meirelles within the ruling MDB party as its leaders came to terms with his dismal chances of reelection and as key allies began to launch their own candidates.\nWith less than five months until the Oct. 7 vote, candidates are still working to build party coalitions and win the attention of voters disenchanted with Brazil’s graft-tainted political class. Investors have been on edge amid uncertainty about the wide-open race and the fate of Temer’s fiscal reforms.\nTemer last week touted his achievements in reviving Latin America’s largest economy, reducing inflation and turning around state-run companies in the two years since he took over from the impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff.\nStill, his approval rating remained stuck at 4 percent in the latest MDA poll that showed that 71 percent of Brazilians considered his government bad or terrible, turned off by a string of corruption scandals and high unemployment.\nHis rejection rate was even higher, with 88 percent of those surveyed saying they would never vote for him.
