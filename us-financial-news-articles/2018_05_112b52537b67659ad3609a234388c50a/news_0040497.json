He was sworn in as Malaysia’s seventh Prime Minister last Thursday after a surprise general election win over rival Najib Razak.\nThe council of advisers met about 180 fund managers in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday to hear their concerns, and also reassure them.\nZeti, who led the discussions, told reporters after the meetings that many issues were raised by investors.\n“But the point that I highlighted is that this change that is taking place in Malaysia is a historic development and it takes place at a time when our economy is doing well,” she said.\n“And it is taking place at a time when the global economy is also rebounding, so this is a very positive environment to undertake these changes.”\nZeti said the country’s fiscal deficit would be improved by controlling expenditure.\n“There will be a re-prioritizing of projects, efforts to increase efficiency of the government, efforts to reduce wastage of the public sector. All this will improve the fiscal position,” Zeti said.\nMalaysian markets have reacted positively to 92-year-old Mahathir’s surprise election win. The stock market was up 0.4 percent at 0700 GMT on Tuesday after making a 0.21 percent gain on Monday.\nThe ringgit was also stronger after dipping offshore last week in the wake of the election.\nZeti said the ringgit will perform better when confidence is restored.\n“Especially when the fiscal regime and the fiscal conditions improve, this is the final factor that will contribute to us having a better opportunity to have our ratings improved,” Zeti said.\nReporting by A.Ananthalakshmi; writing by Praveen Menon; editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
