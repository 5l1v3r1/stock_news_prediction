Taliban fighters were also pushed back in Teshkan district, where they had taken a number of checkpoints.\n“The Taliban suffered heavy casualties, but there is no updated information on the exact number as the area is remote and the telecommunication system weak,” he said.\nWith the Taliban’s annual spring offensive well under way, there was violence in several parts of the country.\nLate on Saturday, a district governor in Paktia province, on the border with Pakistan, was among five people wounded in a car bomb explosion, Abdullah Hasrat, spokesman for the Paktia provincial governor said.\nAlso on Saturday, a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives in an attack on a house belonging to Kandahar police chief Abdul Razeq in Spin Boldak on the border with Pakistan.\nRazeq, who has a fearsome reputation fighting the Taliban and who has survived dozens of assassination attempts, was not harmed in the attack, which he confirmed had taken place.\nReporting by Qadir Sediqi and Sayed Sarwar Amani in KANDAHAR; Editing by James Mackenzie and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T09:03:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
