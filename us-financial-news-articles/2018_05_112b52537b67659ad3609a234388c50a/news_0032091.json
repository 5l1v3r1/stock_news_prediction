Our answer was: We will be in construction in 2018. I reaffirm that commitment today.”\nCalitz later told reporters that a trade spat over imported fabricated industrial steel components (FISC) was no longer an issue for the project and would not have any impact on an investment decision by the joint venture partners.\nLNG Canada had asked Canada’s Finance Ministry to exempt it from the 45.8 percent anti-dumping tariffs, which apply to certain FISC components imported from Spain, South Korea and China. LNG trains, most of which are built in Asia, are FISC components.\nCalitz did not make clear why the FISC duties were no longer an issue, but said the modules have been contracted and the company has more clarity on the parameters and legal application of the tariffs.\nLNG Canada is a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ), PetroChina Co Ltd ( 601857.SS ), Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ) and Korea Gas Corp ( 036460.KS ). TransCanada Corp ( TRP.TO ) will build the pipeline.
