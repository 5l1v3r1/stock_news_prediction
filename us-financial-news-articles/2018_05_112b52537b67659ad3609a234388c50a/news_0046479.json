Concerns about the U.S. deficits and rising government debt needs are also weighing on bonds.\nTwo-year note yields, which are the most sensitive to rate hikes, rose as high as 2.598 percent on Thursday, the highest since August 2008, before falling back to 2.569 percent on Monday.\nBenchmark 10-year note yields rose to 3.128 percent on Friday, the highest since July 2011, before falling back to 3.074 percent on Monday.\nThe Fed will release minutes from its May meeting on Wednesday, which will be further evaluated for indications of how many rate hikes are likely this year.\nThe U.S. central bank left rates unchanged at the meeting and expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation to near the U.S. central bank’s target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.\nThe government will also sell $16 billion in two-year floating rate notes on Wednesday.
