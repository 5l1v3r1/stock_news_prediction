REUTERS/ Dinuka Liyanawatte His comments came in a policy statement at the first session of the parliament since he suspended it last month after 16 of his party legislators defected from the government.,\nHis coalition still has a majority, but the defections will dent its stability in parliament and affect its ability to pass key laws.\n“..the power struggle among the parties in the national government as well as the power struggle between the government and the opposition must be contained. It is the people who are aggravated by all forms of conflicts over power,” Sirisena told the parliament.\nSri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena announces the policy statement at the 8th session of the parliament after suspended the legislature on April 12 during a ceremony in Colombo, Sri Lanka May 8,2018. REUTERS/ Dinuka Liyanawatte The political parties led by Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe formed a national government after the last parliamentary election in August 2015. But Sirisena’s center-left party has opposed many liberal economic policy measures proposed by Wickremesinghe’s center-right UNP.\nWickremesinghe survived a confidence vote last month sponsored by opponents who blame him for failing to prevent an alleged scam in the bond market and anti-Muslim riots in March.\nSirisena’s government is also under fire for not fulfilling his main 2015 election pledge to eliminate rampant corruption.\nOn Tuesday the government said it would establish special courts to speed up long delayed murder and corruption cases.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T00:11:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
