In addition, Ryan D. Shepherd has been promoted from President to Chief Executive Officer of KAILO.

Dr. Cook will retain his role as Chairman of the Board for KAILO Energy, and will refocus his efforts as CEO and Chairman of Global Unicorn Holdings, Inc., the parent company for KAILO.\n\"Ryan is incredibly competent and has been the driving force in developing KAILO clean energy products,” said Cook. He has proven his leadership ability and I am confident that KAILO will experience amazing growth in sales, while continuing to develop new and exciting opportunities in the clean energy space.”\nThe PowerBox is a portable home battery backup system that allows home users to power essential electric systems when the power is out.

Pre-order sales are expected to be completed by mid-June. In addition, new sales positions are being filled to continue to promote and sell the PowerBox.\n“Dr. Cook’s leadership has propelled KAILO through the development process and we will continue to build on the foundation he has established,” explained Shepherd. “We have a great product that I believe will significantly improve the lives of our customers.”\nAbout:\nKAILO Energy, a Global Unicorn Holdings company, manufactures high-tech residential batteries and energy management solutions for home owners around the world.
