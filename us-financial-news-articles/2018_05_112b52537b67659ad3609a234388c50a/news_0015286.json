(“Jamieson Wellness” or the “Company”) (TSX: JWEL) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars. Certain metrics, including those expressed on an adjusted basis, are non-IFRS measures. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below.\nHighlights of First Quarter 2018 Results versus First Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenue increased 8.0% to $70.1 million; Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.0% to $12.7 million; Net Income was $4.6 million and Adjusted Net Income increased 165.4% to $5.8 million; Earnings per diluted share were $0.12 and Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.15.\n“The Jamieson brand continues to enjoy excellent momentum during the first quarter driven by strong consumer demand and the launch of our new Jamieson Essentials plus Protein. Jamieson brands led sales gains in the quarter, driving 8.0% consolidated revenue growth and strong increases in both Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA,” said Mark Hornick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Jamieson Wellness. “Strategic Partners revenue was impacted by the timing of orders, which we anticipate will balance out in the third and fourth quarters. We have also begun the integration of our health food operations, including the consolidation of our distribution facilities and the integration of the salesforce. We remain confident with our 2018 outlook, our innovation pipeline and are focused on capturing incremental international growth opportunities.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenue increased 8.0% to $70.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $64.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 and was driven by a 13.2% increase in Jamieson Brands revenue, partially offset by a 14.8% decrease in Strategic Partners revenue. The increase in the Jamieson Brands revenue was driven by 7.8% organic growth and the acquisition of Body Plus. The decrease in Strategic Partners was primarily driven by the timing of customer orders, including the launch of customer branded innovation during the first quarter of 2017 that was not repeated in first quarter of 2018.\nGross profit increased 14.2% to $25.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $22.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 and gross profit margin increased 200 basis points to 36.2% from 34.2% in the same respective period. The increase in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by segment mix, manufacturing efficiencies and includes higher relative margins from Sonoma activities.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased 10.2% to $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 21.1% from 20.7% in the prior year period. The increase as a percentage of revenue reflected the inclusion of $0.6 million of public company costs and the higher SG&A as a percentage of revenue associated with the acquired businesses, partially offset by $0.7 million of lower marketing costs as marketing spend this year is aligned to support the launch of Jamieson Essentials plus Protein in the second quarter of 2018.\nOperating income increased 26.2% to $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 and operating margin increased 200 basis points to 14.4% from 12.4% in the same respective periods.\nInterest expense and other financing costs were $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The change was driven by lower borrowings including discharge of the note payable to Jamieson Finco LP in the pre-IPO reorganization, lower interest rates on the Company’s credit facility entered into in January 2017 and a write-off of deferred financing fees in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.6 million compared to net loss of $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net Income, which excludes all non-operating expenses, increased to $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted Net Income for the first quarter of 2018 excludes costs associated with termination benefits and related costs, business integration costs, foreign exchange losses, other non-recurring expenses and adjusts for purchase consideration accounted for as compensation expense, as well as the related tax effects of each item. Adjusted Net Income for the first quarter of 2017 excludes costs associated with preferred share accretion, write-off of deferred financing fees, termination benefits and related costs, acquisition costs, purchase consideration accounted for as compensation expense, amortization of fair value adjustments, share based compensation, foreign exchange loss, public offering costs, other non-recurring expenses and related tax effects. A detailed reconciliation of reported net income to non-IFRS Adjusted Net Income is included in the tables accompanying this release under the heading Non-IFRS measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 11.0% to $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 18.1% compared to 17.6% in the prior year period.\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\nThe Company used $5.2 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2018 compared to generating $8.1 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2017. The decrease reflects deferred compensation associated with the acquisition of Body Plus and Sonoma and higher inventories relating to the timing of sales in the Strategic Partners segment. The Company’s cash at March 31, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to $4.8 million on December 31, 2017. On February 27, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per common share to holders of record as of March 7, 2018 and paid such dividend on March 15, 2018. The dividend payment was approximately $3.0 million in the aggregate.\nThree months ended March 31 ($ in 000's) 2018 2017\n$ Change\n% Change Cash, beginning of period 4,833 15,881 (11,048 ) (69.6 %) Cash flows from (used in): Operating activities (5,159 ) 8,114 (13,273 ) (163.6 %) Investing activities (3,066 ) (83,204 ) 80,138 96.3 % Financing activities 5,765 67,604 (61,839 ) (91.5 %) Cash, end of period 2,373 8,395 (6,022 ) (71.7 %) Outlook\nThe Company is reiterating its outlook for fiscal 2018, which was initially provided when the Company reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on February 22, 2018. The company continues to anticipate generating revenue in a range of $325.0 to $335.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $67.0 to $69.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $0.83 to $0.87. This outlook is based, in part, on a forecasted CAD/USD exchange rate of $1.25, the potential for higher interest rates and a fully diluted share count of approximately 39.8 million shares.\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and accompanying notes as at and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) are available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://investors.jamiesonwellness.com .\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 results at 5:00 p.m. ET on May 9, 2018.

Management uses these non-IFRS financial measures for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of ongoing operations and in analyzing the Company’s business performance and trends. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures, including “gross profit”, “gross profit margin”, “operating margin” “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA margin”, “Adjusted Net Income” and “Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share” to provide supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company’s core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to prepare annual operating budgets and to determine components of management compensation. Definitions of non-IFRS measures can be found in our MD&A.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income\nIn thousands of Canadian dollars\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Net income (loss) 4,626 (21,651 ) Adjustments to net income (loss): Share-based compensation - 441 Amortization of fair value adjustments - 565 Amortization of deferred financing fee - 3,078 Foreign exchange loss 200 232 Termination benefits and related costs 1,732 2,499 Acquisition costs - 1,857 Purchase consideration accounted for as compensation expense (1,066 ) 1,476 Public offering costs - 231 Preferred share accretion - 15,385 Non-recurring business integration 961 - Other 93 213 Related tax effects (786 ) (2,156 ) Adjusted net income 5,760 2,170 Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nIn thousands of Canadian dollars\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Net income (loss) 4,626 (21,651 ) Add: Provision for (recovery of) income taxes 1,404 (546 ) Interest expense and other financing costs 2,176 8,312 Preferred share accretion - 15,385 Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment 1,263 1,271 Amortization of intangible assets 870 834 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) 10,339 3,605 Add EBITDA adjustments: Share-based compensation 427 746 Amortization of fair value adjustments - 565 Foreign exchange loss 200 232 Termination benefits and related costs 1,732 2,499 Acquisition costs - 1,857 Purchase consideration accounted for as compensation expense (1,066 ) 1,476 Public offering costs - 231 Non-recurring business integration 961 - Other 93 213 Adjusted EBITDA 12,686 11,424\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006260/en/\nInvestor Relations\nICR\nScott Van Winkle\n617-956-6736\nScott.VanWinkle@ICRinc.com\nor\nMedia\nICR\nMary Nelson\n646-277-1219\nMary.Nelson@ICRinc.com\nSource: Jamieson Wellness Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedar.com&esheet=51803762&newsitemid=20180509006260&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sedar.com&index=1&md5=77cf8ce1791d7036ee619fb136981e03", "http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=12", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.jamiesonwellness.com&esheet=51803762&newsitemid=20180509006260&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.jamiesonwellness.com&index=2&md5=82aeee978b189ed6d83ffae717199173", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006260/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.viavid.com%2Findex.php%3Fid%3D12&esheet=51803762&newsitemid=20180509006260&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.viavid.com%2Findex.php%3Fid%3D12&index=4&md5=a166bb3799c865304bcd45de8afc3941", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.jamiesonwellness.com&esheet=51803762&newsitemid=20180509006260&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.jamiesonwellness.com&index=3&md5=22fd3fdb503067d1c16b05d7e6713db1"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T23:52:02.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
