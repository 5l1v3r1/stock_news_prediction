Transactions had already been constrained as many large foreign banks remained wary of trade even under the nuclear deal.\n“The exodus by the limited number of foreign banks willing to process transactions with Iran is a big blow, especially on the trade finance side,”one finance source said.\nThe 2015 nuclear agreement, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for limits to its nuclear program.\nTehran is pressuring Europe to come up with a package of economic measures by May 31 after major powers agreed on Friday to move quickly to offset Washington’s withdrawal from the deal.\nThose measures include banning EU-based firms from complying with the reimposed U.S. sanctions, urging governments to make transfers to Iran’s central bank to avoid fines and creating alternative financing channels.\nBut analysts say there are big challenges to keeping the nuclear deal alive.\n“The U.S. sanctions will make Iran’s business environment more difficult to operate in,” BMI Research said in a note last week.\n“Firms that ... have exposure to the U.S. market are therefore unlikely to want to maintain or expand their Iranian presence for fear of U.S. sanction related penalties and backlash in the U.S. market.” Editing by Adrian Croft and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T14:39:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
