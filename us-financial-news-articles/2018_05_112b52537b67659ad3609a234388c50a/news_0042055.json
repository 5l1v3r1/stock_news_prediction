The United States relocated its embassy to Jerusalem a week ago, drawing Palestinian anger. It was followed by Guatemala on Wednesday.\nThe status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who with broad international backing want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as their capital.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gestures as he stands next to Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes during a meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, following the dedication ceremony of the embassy of Paraguay in Jerusalem, May 21, 2018.

Sebastian Scheiner/Pool via Reuters “This is a historic day that strengthens ties between Paraguay and Israel,” Cartes said at the ceremony.\n“A great day for Israel. A great day for Paraguay. A great day for our friendship,” Netanyahu responded. “You have not only the support of our government but the profound gratitude of the people Israel.”\nHanan Ashrawi, an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization, denounced Paraguay’s move.\n“By adopting such a provocative and irresponsible measure that is in direct contravention of international law and consensus, Paraguay has conspired with Israel, the United States and Guatemala to entrench the military occupation and to seal the fate of occupied Jerusalem,” Ashrawi said in a statement.\nIn December, U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of U.S. policy and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies.\nMost world powers do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city and says its final status should be set in peace negotiations.\nReporting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Dan Williams and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T12:28:45.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
