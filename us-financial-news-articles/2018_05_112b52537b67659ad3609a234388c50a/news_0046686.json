World number one Simona Halep will face Elina Svitolina in a repeat of last year’s Italian Open final after recovering from a set down to beat Russian Maria Sharapova 4-6 6-1 6-4 in Rome on Saturday.\nTennis - WTA Premier 5 - Italian Open - Foro Italico, Rome, Italy - May 19, 2018 Ukraine's Elina Svitolina celebrates winning her semi final match against Estonia's Anett Kontaveit REUTERS/Tony Gentile Defending champion Svitolina put in a clinical performance earlier in the day to beat unseeded Estonian Anett Kontaveit 6-4 6-3 in the other semi-final.\nHalep and Sharapova both made nervy starts, with neither able to hold serve until the seventh game, when the Russian finally managed to get her nose in front.\nThat proved to be the only hold of the first set, with Sharapova relinquishing her serve once more either side of breaking Halep to clinch the opener.\nThe Romanian came out stronger at the start of the second set, breaking Sharapova in the first game before holding service for the first time in the match to go 2-0 up.\nShe saved break points to extend her lead to 3-1 and then 5-1 before leveling the match.\nTennis -
