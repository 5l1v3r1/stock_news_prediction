REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo The U.S. oil firm’s actions so far have included the seizure of oil inventories and assets in the Caribbean islands where PDVSA operates. The measures have forced the state-run company to halt storage and shipping from at least four terminals, creating a bottleneck of tankers around its Venezuelan ports.\n“We look forward to hearing PDVSA’s proposals to resolve this matter. But absent any agreement and payment of the ICC award, we will continue our enforcement actions,” said Janet Langford Carrig, Conoco’s general counsel.\nReporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T23:16:45.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
