Revenues resulted primarily from sales in the United States and Europe of our dermaPACE ® and orthoPACE ® devices and related applicators. The increase in revenues for 2018 was due to first sale of dermaPACE ® devices and applicators in the United States after obtaining FDA approval and slight increase in refurbishment applicator sales.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1,300,066, compared to $718,064 for the prior period, an increase of $582,002. Research and development expenses increased by $89,106, as a result of hiring of a full-time software engineer, accrual of bonus for 2018 and a grant given to a university for clinical work to be performed. General and administrative expenses increased by $497,000, due to hiring of a human resources director, higher travel costs, accrual of bonus for 2018, recruiting fees for open positions, higher legal and accounting fees related to SEC filings and higher consultant fees related to the commercialization of dermaPACE ® .\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5,856,655, or ($0.04) per share, compared with a net loss of $493,532, or ($0.00) per share for the same period in 2017, which is an increase in the net loss of $5,363,123. The increase in the net loss for 2018 was a result of higher interest expense related to convertible promissory notes, an increased loss on warrant valuation, and increase in operating expenses discussed above.\nOn March 31, 2018, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of $154,205 compared to $730,184 as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $575,979. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash used by operating activities was $1,848,553 and $114,884 respectively, primarily consisting of compensation costs, research and development activities and general corporate operations. The increase in the use of cash for operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period for 2017, of $1,733,669 was primarily due to the increased operating expenses and decreased payables in 2018. Net cash used by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 consisted of purchase of property and equipment of $7,720. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1,279,371 which consisted of $1,159,785 from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, $94,058 net from note payable, product, $13,528 from the exercise of warrants and $12,000 from the advances from related parties for exercise of warrants.
