Odorizzi left with a 5-1 lead after throwing 93 pitches.\nRyan Pressly worked two innings, and Taylor Rogers and Phil Hughes hurled one each to secure the win for Odorizzi. Each of the three relievers faced the minimum of batters, as the Cardinals left just two runners on base in the game.\nCarlos Martinez (3-2) took the loss for the Cardinals, allowing four runs (two earned) and four hits in five innings of work. Martinez struck out two and walked three.\nThe Cardinals stuck first, scoring in the opening inning on Jose Martinez’s solo home run over the center field fence.\nMinnesota responded with run in the second as Ehire Adrianza’s sacrifice fly drove home Rosario. The Twins took the lead in the fourth when Mitch Garver singled in Rosario and played add-on in the fifth as Robbie Grossman’s double plated Brian Dozier and Rosario.\nLogan Morrison’s single in the sixth pushed Adrianza to the plate and made the score 5-1. Eduardo Escobar then ripped a two-run home run in the seventh to push the Twins’ advantage to 7-1.\nThe Twins and Cardinals each have the day off on Wednesday before heading to the West Coast to begin four-game series in Los Angeles and San Diego, respectively.\nMinnesota will play the Angels, with right-hander Jose Berrios (3-3, 3.98 ERA) getting the ball Thursday for the Twins while Los Angeles’ starting pitcher is still to be determined.\nRight-hander Miles Mikolas (4-0, 2.70 ERA) gets the start for the Cardinals on Thursday and will be opposed by Padres right-hander Jordan Lyles (0-0, 3.66).\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:48:25.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
