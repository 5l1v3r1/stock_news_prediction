The lowered duties will take effect July 1 and come after the Trump administration agreed this weekend to hold off on imposing tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods.\nChina is a major market for U.S. automakers, and shares of General Motors and Ford rose more than half a percent in Tuesday trading.\nBut when it comes to global trade, Germany sells more passenger cars in China than any other country does, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\nIn the first four months of this year, German-made vehicles accounted for 20.8 percent of passenger cars sold in China, or 1.67 million units, the association said in an online post dated Friday. In contrast, American-made cars accounted for 11 percent, in third place behind Japan and a slight decrease from the same period last year, the data showed.\nOf the top 10 brands by sales during that time, Volkswagen-affiliated sedans accounted for six, the association said.\nThe only American brand on the list was General Motors' Buick. Japan's Nissan and Toyota had one car each on the top 10 list, and the lone Chinese-made brand was Geely.\nShares of BMW climbed 2.75 percent, Volkswagen gained 2.2 percent and Daimler rose nearly 1.7 percent, as some of the top advancers in the German DAX in Tuesday trading.\nIn 2017, Chinese imports of automobiles rose well over 15 percent to 1.2 million vehicles, the association said.
