Matrix reports these increases, in spite of the competition in the sector in which Matrix operates the frequent changes and the challenges in recruiting technology experts. Matrix reported record-breaking revenues of NIS 777.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting an increase of 11.6% year over year. Operating income increased to NIS 52.1 million, reflecting an increase of 7.2% year over year and net income attributable to Matrix shareholders soared to NIS3 4.2 million, reflecting an increase of 21.9% year over year.\"\n“Matrix has zeroed in on the U.S. market as its next strategic market and is currently in the process of merging a number of U.S. companies that it has acquired over the past two years. At the same time, Matrix continues to acquire companies and activities in Israel to expand its value propositions to its customers in the areas of analytics and big data, cyber, cloud computing, digital and mobile, regulation and compliance, training and deployment. Matrix continues to be recognized as a leading company in Israel, including being ranked among the top 50 companies and the first among all the software services companies in Israel.”\n“Magic continued the forward momentum of the very strong 2017 and reported record-breaking results for the first quarter of 2018 powered by the continued high demand for its products and professional services across all of its regions and markets. Magic’s fiscal year 2018 is off to an excellent start with revenues at an all-time high of $69.7 million, operating income of $7.6 million and non-GAAP operating income 1 of $9.7 million, up 15%, 19% and 16% respectively year over year, driven almost exclusively by organic growth.\"\n“In keeping with its successful strategic direction, Magic remains focused on expanding its customer base as it continues to evolve its portfolio with powerful and innovative technologies in the fields of software application development, mobile, cloud, big data, and especially in integration, which I believe will account for the majority of an organization’s digital transformation efforts.\"\n“The results of the first quarter of 2018 reflect that Sapiens is back on track with the execution of its long-term strategy to be a leading global provider of insurance software solutions and services. Now that Sapiens has completed the integration of its recent acquisitions including Stone River, Adaptik and KnowledgePrice, it is able to realize deal synergies while maximizing its acquired talent. The first quarter non-GAAP 2 operating margin was 12.5% and Sapiens remains on track to improve operating margins throughout 2018 and reiterate the 2018 non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 12% to 13% with revenue in the range of $280-$285 million (on a non-GAAP basis).\"\n“Lastly, since its launch in January 2018, we are pleased with the positive adoption rate of Michpal’s new product and new service line – \"Michpal Pension\" and \"Michpal PensionPlus” – by its existing customer base. This new business line is the first step in our business strategy to expand Michpal’s offerings.”\nAbout Formula\nFormula Systems (1985) Ltd. is a global information technology company engaged, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, in providing software consulting services and computer-based business solutions and developing proprietary software products.\nFor more information, visit www.formulasystems.com .\nExcept for any historical information contained herein, matters discussed in this press release might include forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
