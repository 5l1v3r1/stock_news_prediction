May 15, 2018; Washington, DC, USA; Tampa Bay Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman (77) celebrates after scoring a goal against the Washington Capitals in the second period in game three of the Eastern Conference Final in the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs at Capital One Arena. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\nTampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy, who had appeared rattled at times in the games on his home ice, made 36 saves Tuesday. The Capitals had only six shots in the third period until the waning minutes, and Vasilevskiy stopped all except one of 13 by period’s end.\nWashington goalie Braden Holtby stopped 19 shots. He was pulled with more than three minutes remaining as the Capitals were desperate to create more offense. It paid off with Kuznetsov’s goal with 3:02 to play.\nIn the first two games, Washington scored goals in the waning seconds of a period in each contest. This time, the Lightning prevented the momentum swings.\nAfter Tampa Bay scored the game’s first three goals, Connolly tallied for the Capitals midway through the second period.

He took a feed from Hedman, converting for his 10th career postseason power-play goal — a franchise record.\nWashington registered 14 first-period shots without scoring.\nKucherov and Hedman scored within a two-minute span early in the second period.\nAfter Kucherov’s power-play tally at 1:50, Hedman was left alone on the right side and sent a sizzling shot past Holtby to stretch the lead to 3-0 at 3:37.\n“That’s a great team over there. They didn’t do what they did all year because of a fluke,” Washington center Jay Beagle said. “We know they’re really dangerous off the rush and we’re trying limit their odd-man rushes. ... Limiting turnovers at their blue line is also a big factor.”\nCapitals center Nicklas Backstrom remained out of the lineup despite going through the morning skate. He has yet to play this series due to a hand injury sustained in the previous round.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T07:16:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
