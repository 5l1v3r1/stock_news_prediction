Were pleased that USTR is going to look into the unfair treatment U.S. goods are getting from Thailand, he said.\nIn April the NPPC filed a GSP review with the trade representative's office, citing Thailand's failure to provide access to its market for U.S. products - including pork.\nThe group said Thailand, through exorbitant tariffs and \"de facto bans,\" severely limits U.S. pork exports while enjoying its Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate on agriculture imports into the United States.\nNPPC urged the Trump administration to withdraw or limit Thailand's benefits under the MFN program, which allows for removal of a countrys benefits if the United States is not allowed fair and reasonable access to its market.\nIn 2017, U.S. pork exports to Thailand totaled 31 tonnes valued at roughly $128,000, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The European Union supplies the vast majority of Thailand's imported pork, USMEF said.
