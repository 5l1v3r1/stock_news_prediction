The only question now is if the Rockets will return home as Western Conference champs or with a Game 7 against Golden State on deck.\nOn Friday, James Harden said he and Paul stayed together and were “just talking and chopping it up, laughing and talking about life. We’re not here to be down and moping around and sad. We’ll be good.”\nHead coach Mike D’Antoni said Eric Gordon would be called upon to fill more of a playmaking role with Paul out.\n—Warriors head coach Steve Kerr claims he likes where the team is entering Game 6 with a 3-2 deficit in the Western Conference finals series with the Rockets.
