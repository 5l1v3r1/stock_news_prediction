What are these risks? First and foremost, an escalation of trade tensions should be avoided,\" acting OECD chief economist Alvaro Pereira wrote in an introduction to the organization's biannual Economic Outlook.\nThe warning comes as European governments brace for the expiration of temporary exemptions on new U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs on June 1, which has outraged Washington's closest allies.\nThough the number of trade restrictions has crept higher over the last decade, further measures could create a significant drag on growth because the global economy is now more interconnected than ever before, the OECD said.\nOutlook\nWith tax cuts boosting U.S. investment, the world's biggest economy was forecast to grow 2.9 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year.\nAs a result the Federal Reserve was expected to keep gradually increasing its interest rates, bringing the Fed funds rate to 3.25 percent by the end of 2019.\nThe euro area economy was seen growing 2.2 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2019 as the labor market and wages recover. The European Central Bank was seen halting bond purchases this year and increasing its negative deposit rate in the second half of 2019.\nOutside the euro area, the OECD marginally raised its outlook for Britain to 1.4 percent growth this year and 1.3 percent in 2019. The Bank of England was expected to only gradually raise interest rates given the uncertainty over Brexit.\nJapanese growth was seen at 1.2 percent both this and next year as growing labor shortages force companies to increase business investment and hire more workers.\nOutside of the OECD, Chinese growth was expected to ease gradually from 6.7 percent this year to 6.4 percent in 2019 as infrastructure investment slows in the face of tighter lending conditions and tougher government project approvals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:46:06.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
