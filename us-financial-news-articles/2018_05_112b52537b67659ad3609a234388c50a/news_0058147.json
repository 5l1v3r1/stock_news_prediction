China is the world’s biggest crude oil importer.\nOil prices have risen to their highest since 2014 after U.S. President Donald Trump on May 8 announced his decision to exit an international nuclear deal with Iran and revive sanctions on OPEC’s third-largest producer, amid fears of tight supplies.\nCrude exports from Iran could drop by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1 million barrels bpd as a result of U.S. sanctions, according to BP.\nOn Friday, however, Brent crude fell more than 2 percent towards $77 a barrel as Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs.\nReporting by Josephine Mason and Tom Daly; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:18:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
