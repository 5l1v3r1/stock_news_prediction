Disappointing growth data on Japan, together with concerns about the financial demands of a potential Italian coalition government from its neighbors, caused a drop in German bond yields and stemmed another jump in U.S. yields. Tuesday's sharp rise in the 10-year yield above 3.05 percent, which was seen as a key technical support level, unnerved Wall Street as traders considered whether U.S. bonds are gaining appeal as an alternative to riskier stocks. As the bond market stabilized, investors said U.S. yields would likely hold at the higher levels until there were meaningful changes in economic data or signs that Federal Reserve officials are moving away from the current monetary policy stance of a gradual pace of interest rate increases, analysts said. \"Cooler heads have prevailed following bets that pushed up the 10-year yield based on more optimism about growth and inflation,\" said Craig Bishop, lead strategist of the fixed income group at RBC Wealth Management in Minneapolis. Data on Wednesday supported traders' view that the economy is expanding but far from firing on all cylinders. U.S. industrial output grew 0.7 percent in April, while home construction declined 3.7 percent last month, government data showed. At 10:55 a.m. (1455 GMT), the 10-year Treasury yield was up 0.9 basis point at 3.089 percent after touching 3.095 percent, which was the highest level since July 2011, on Tuesday, Reuters data showed. The 10-year yield reversed an initial decline as Wall Street stock prices recovered some of Tuesday's losses. It fell earlier in step with a fall in German Bund yields.
