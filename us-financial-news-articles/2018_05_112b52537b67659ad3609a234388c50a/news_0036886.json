It also added 239,000 mobile customers over the same period, its best quarterly performance on record.\nBROADBAND BATTLE SFR’s quarterly revenue decreased on a yearly basis, by 1.1 percent to about 2.6 billion euros ($3.07 billion).\nGrowth is expected as the company adds broadband customers, in particular those opting for the more profitable fiber technology, and loses fewer subscribers.\nAltice’s performance in the fixed business contrasted with that of rival Iliad ( ILD.PA ), whose shares plummeted after admitting it had lost broadband customers for the first time.\nHeavy investments on fixed networks, combined with prolonged heavy promotions by SFR and competitors Iliad, Orange ( ORAN.PA ) and Bouygues Telecom ( BOUY.PA ), have led to cut-throat competition in the French telecoms sector.\n“There’s going to be a battle between the four on the market in 2018,” said Xavier Buffon, an analyst at S&P who covers Altice.\nAltice Europe’s total revenues remained flat over the quarter on a constant currency basis at 3.53 billion euros. Core operating profit dipped by 0.5 percent on the same basis to about 1.3 billion euros.\nThe sale of assets Altice deems non-essential, such its Dominican Republic unit and French and German towers, will be finalized in the second half, Altice said.\nThe group confirmed but adjusted its full-year guidance to reflect the adoption of a new accounting standard. It said its separation with Altice USA ( ATUS.N ) will be effective early June.\nReporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:28:34.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
