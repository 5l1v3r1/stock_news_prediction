By then, the game was well in hand, with Chicago collecting a whopping 15 hits off three Reds pitchers. Willson Contreras went 3-for-6 with an RBI while Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo each bagged two hits.\nAfter a 93-minute rain delay before first pitch, the first five Cubs to bat touched Homer Bailey (1-6) for hits. Ben Zobrist singled and Bryant doubled to set the table. Rizzo, Contreras and Russell all dug in and took bites with RBI singles for a 3-0 lead before Bailey got his first out.\nChicago made it 4-0 in the third when Javier Baez grounded into a double play with the bases loaded, scoring Contreras. By the time the Cubs had circled through their order twice, Bailey was coming to the plate for his first at-bat in the third.\nIt was unsuccessful, like most of Cincinnati’s plate appearances against Lester. The veteran left-hander didn’t allow a hit until second baseman Scooter Gennett started the fourth with a single to right. But the hit was erased four pitches later by a 5-4-3 double play ball off Eugenio Suarez’s bat.\nLester (4-1) walked one and struck out eight in six innings. His shutout bid ended when Adam Duvall led off the fifth with his ninth homer, a 386-foot blast to left-center field.\nBy then, the Cubs had sent Bailey packing with two runs in their half of the fifth. Kyle Schwarber followed Russell’s third hit by lacing a double to center that scored him from first. Lester later helped the offense by dropping a squeeze bunt which plated Schwarber.\nBailey lasted 4 2/3 innings, allowing 10 hits and six runs with five walks and three strikeouts.\nBaez’s infield hit in the eighth scored Rizzo to make it 7-1, and an error by Gennett in the ninth chased Albert Almora Jr. home to cap the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:21:17.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
