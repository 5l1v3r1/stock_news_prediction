Pursuant to the recently completed plan of arrangement under which NextView New Energy Lion Hong Kong Limited (\"NextView\") acquired Lithium X, the rights under that Investor Rights Agreement now pass to NextView. The Company has been advised that NextView is not yet ready to nominate its director to Pure Energy’s board and Mr. Moubarak’s contract with NextView has ended. The Company thanks Mr. Moubarak for his able assistance and leadership over the past year.\nPatrick Highsmith, Pure Energy’s President & CEO, commented on the board changes, “ We are pleased to welcome Frank Wells to the Pure Energy board of directors. Frank brings strategic thinking from major mining company experience and particular financial insight into new projects and business development. He has seen so many projects and so many transactions that his work has a terrific practicality and simplicity to it. We look forward to his valued input on the audit committee, where Bassam has been so helpful over the last year. The Board also wishes Bassam good fortune in his future endeavors.”\nMr. Wells has more than 35 years of diverse experience as a financial analyst, business development specialist, financial officer, and director. He spent 17 years with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp. in senior business development and planning positions in the western US and around the world. Mr. Wells also acted as Finance Director and CFO of Central Asia Metals Ltd. His recent experience includes extensive financial modeling in association with advanced engineering studies and acquisition opportunities in the gold, lithium, copper, lead-zinc, rare earth element, and chromite sectors.\nMr. Wells has considerable financing and transactional experience, including helping to raise tens of millions of dollars as Central Asia Metals built its portfolio of assets and put its SX-EW Kazakhstan copper project into production. He is also an expert at project valuation, having participated from both the buy and sell sides in the negotiations and execution of numerous mineral asset transactions. Mr. Wells has a bachelor of arts degree from The Johns Hopkins University and an MBA from Duke University.\nIssuance of Stock Options\nThe Company also announces, subject to regulatory approval, it has granted a total of 250,000 stock options (the “Options”) to a director of the Company to purchase common shares of the Company in accordance with its stock option plan.
