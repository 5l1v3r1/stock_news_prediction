The companies have filed an all-parties, all-issues settlement agreement in the merger proceeding before the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (“OPUC”). This represents a full settlement which all parties have agreed is consistent with the public interest and will provide net benefits to Avista’s Oregon customers. The settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the OPUC.\n“This is yet another key milestone as we navigate the path toward completing this transaction,” said Mayo Schmidt, President and CEO, Hydro One. “Once complete, this merger of two leading institutions will generate tremendous value for our organization, as well as our shareholders, employees and customers. We are very pleased by the progress we have been able to achieve in cooperation with all parties involved.”\n“This settlement agreement is a positive next step in the process to finalize our partnership with Hydro One, for the benefit of our customers in Oregon and all of our stakeholders,” Avista Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott L. Morris said. “With the broad support of all of the parties in Oregon, we believe the settlement agreement meets the standard for approval in Oregon and affirms the commitments we’ve made to continue to operate as we do today, with local decision-making and increased community support.”\nThe settlement agreement in Oregon includes financial and non-financial commitments, and confirms Avista’s commitment to its customers and the communities it serves. Under the settlement agreement, customers in Oregon would receive immediate financial benefits in the form of rate credits that would become effective at the close of the transaction, along with additional safeguards to assure the continued financial well-being of Avista.\nAs a result of this settlement agreement in Oregon, settlement agreements in Washington, Idaho and Alaska and commitments in Montana, the total financial commitment across all states, if approved, would be approximately $78.6 million.
