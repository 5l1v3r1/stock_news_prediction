There are currently 20,000,000 Series F Shares outstanding.\nWith respect to any Series F Shares that remain outstanding after June 1, 2018, holders thereof will be entitled to receive quarterly fixed cumulative preferential cash dividends, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of Enbridge.

The dividend rate applicable to the Series G Shares for the three-month floating rate period commencing on June 1, 2018 to, but excluding, September 1, 2018 will be 0.93764 percent, based on the annual rate on three month Government of Canada treasury bills for the most recent treasury bills auction of 1.21 percent plus 2.51 percent in accordance with the terms of the Series G Shares (the Floating Quarterly Dividend Rate).
