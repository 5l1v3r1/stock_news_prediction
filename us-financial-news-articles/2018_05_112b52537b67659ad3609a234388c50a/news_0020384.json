(NASDAQ:RVNC), a biotechnology company developing neuromodulators for use in treating aesthetic and therapeutic conditions, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRecent Company Highlights and Upcoming Milestones for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002):\nExpects to report the SAKURA 3 open-label, long-term safety study of RT002 for the treatment of glabellar (frown) lines in the second half of 2018. On track to file a Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for RT002 to treat glabellar (frown) lines in first half of 2019. Plans to commence enrollment in the ASPEN Phase 3 program with RT002 for the treatment of moderate to severe isolated cervical dystonia for the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. The program is expected to include a single pivotal trial, plus an open-label trial, totaling approximately 300 patients from the U.S., Canada and Europe. Announced a collaboration and license agreement in February 2018 with Mylan Ireland Limited, on a biosimilar to BOTOX® that provided for an upfront payment of $25 million to Revance, with contingent payments upon achievement of additional clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, plus sales royalties worldwide (except Japan).\n“With unparalleled 6-month duration demonstrated in the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials, the next major RT002 milestone is the reporting of the SAKURA 3 open-label results later this year. SAKURA 3 represents one of the largest data sets collected with a neuromodulator for an aesthetic indication, with at least 2,500 patients evaluated over two years. We believe the upcoming data from SAKURA 3 will further reinforce RT002 as first and best positioned neuromodulator to address the most sought after improvement to currently available products-the need for longer duration,” said Dan Browne, President and Chief Executive Officer at Revance. “As we approach the FDA filing for glabellar lines in the first half of 2019, and expand our pipeline for RT002 to include adult upper limb spasticity and chronic migraine, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our milestones and become the leader in neuromodulators.”\nSummary Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2018 were $268.8 million.\nRevenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $0.2 million compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2017. The $0.2 million recognized for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 represents revenue earned from the $25 million upfront payment for Mylan under the biosimilar collaboration and license agreement.\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $22.2 million compared to $19.4 million for the same period in 2017. The change in research and development expenses is primarily due to the ongoing clinical trials for RT002 for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, and plantar fasciitis and increased costs to support manufacturing, quality efforts and research.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $13.6 million compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased costs related to personnel, consulting and pre-commercial activities to support future product launches.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $35.9 million compared to $27.2 million for the same period in 2017. Stock-based compensation for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $4.2 million. When excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation, total operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $31.3 million.\nNet loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $35.0 million compared to $27.2 million for the same period in 2017.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nRevance reiterates its financial guidance provided in January 2018. Revance expects cash burn for 2018 to be in the range of $117 to $137 million. Revance expects 2018 GAAP operating expense to be in the range of $128 to $154 million, which when excluding depreciation of $1 to $3 million and estimated stock-based compensation of $17 to $21 million, results in projected 2018 non-GAAP operating expense of $110 to $130 million, driven by increased research and development expenditure and launch preparation activities. With three clinical programs and preparations to file the BLA all underway, Revance anticipates 2018 GAAP research and development expense to be in the range of $84 to $101 million, which when excluding depreciation of $1 to $2 million and estimated stock-based compensation of $7 to $9 million, results in projected 2018 non-GAAP research and development expense of $76 to $90 million.\nConference Call\nIndividuals interested in listening to the conference call may do so by dialing (855) 453-3827 for domestic callers, or (484) 756-4301 for international callers and reference conference ID: 4580549; or from the webcast link in the investor relations section of the company's website at: www.revance.com .\nA replay of the call will be available beginning May 8, 2018 at 4:30pm PT/7:30pm ET to May 9, 2018 at 4:30pm PT/7:30pm ET.
