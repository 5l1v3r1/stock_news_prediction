As a result, we had a steep production ramp as we exited the first quarter and continuing into April, after experiencing a significant amount of production downtime in January and February when we shut-in a number of producing wells to accommodate elevated offset completion activity. As evidenced by our recent well highlights, we continue to see compelling well results from both our Delaware and Midland Basin positions and we are on track to deliver on our production guidance for the year.\"\nMr. Gray continued, “We are excited about our pending transaction with Concho, which creates one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin with the largest development program. I want to thank our Board, management team, employees, shareholders, vendors and all of our partners for the outstanding accomplishments we have achieved together and express my gratitude for the opportunity to lead this organization.”\nProposed Merger with Concho Resources\nAs previously announced, on March 27, 2018, RSP and Concho entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which Concho will acquire RSP in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9.5 billion, inclusive of RSP’s net debt. Stockholders of RSP will receive 0.320 shares of Concho common stock in exchange for each share of RSP's common stock, representing consideration to each stockholder of RSP of $50.24 per share based on the closing price of Concho common stock on March 27, 2018. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to the approval of both RSP and Concho stockholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nIn light of the pending merger with Concho, we do not in general plan to provide or update guidance and long-term outlook information regarding our results of operations during the pendency of the merger.

(2) Average prices for oil are net of transportation costs. Average prices for natural gas and NGLs in the first quarter of 2018 were impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\"), which requires certain transportation, gathering, processing and compression fees paid to the Company's midstream processing entity to be recorded as a deduction to revenues. Prior to 2018, these fees were recorded as gathering and transportation which are included in lease operating expenses. (3) Represents compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and performance share awards granted as part of the Company’s compensation and retention programs. Production volumes for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 averaged 62,778 Boe/d, or a total of 5,650 MBoe, an increase of 39% over prior year’s first quarter of 45,189 Boe/d.

RSP’s average realized oil price for the first quarter of 2018, before the effects of hedges, was $61.87 per barrel, a negative $1.00 differential compared to average NYMEX WTI pricing of $62.87 per barrel for the same period, or 98% of NYMEX WTI pricing. RSP’s average realized natural gas price for the first quarter of 2018, before the effects of hedges, was $1.98 per Mcf, a negative $1.02 differential compared to average NYMEX Henry Hub pricing of $3.00 per MMBtu for the same period, or 66% of NYMEX Henry Hub pricing. RSP’s average realized NGL price for the first quarter of 2018 was $18.33 per Bbl, or 29% of NYMEX WTI pricing for the same time period. RSP’s average realized commodity price per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2018, before the effects of hedges, was $48.91. Per unit cash operating expenses excluding interest expense but including lease operating expense, gathering and transportation expense, production and ad valorem taxes and recurring cash general and administrative expenses were $10.17 per Boe.\nOperational Update\nThe Company operated seven horizontal rigs and three full-time completion crews during the first quarter of 2018 (third crew added in late January). RSP drilled 22 gross operated horizontal wells and completed 31 gross operated horizontal wells (Midland: seven Lower Spraberry, seven Wolfcamp A, five Wolfcamp B, one Middle Spraberry; Delaware: five Wolfcamp A, four Wolfcamp XY, one Second Bone Spring and one Third Bone Spring). The Company began the quarter with 36 gross operated horizontal drilled but uncompleted wells (\"DUCs\") and exited the quarter with a total of 27 operated horizontal DUCs.\nFinancial Results\nThree Months Ended (in thousands, except per share data) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Total Revenues $ 276,322 $ 249,023 $ 169,931 Net Cash from Derivative Instruments (13,717 ) (8,566 ) (2,812 ) Adjusted Total Revenues 262,605 240,457 167,119 Net Income $ 89,573 $ 140,786 $ 38,934 Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted 0.57 0.89 0.26 Adjusted Net Income (1) $ 79,033 $ 50,122 $ 24,212 Adjusted Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted 0.50 0.32 0.16 Adjusted EBITDAX (1) $ 205,202 $ 182,425 $ 124,451 (1) Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted Net Income deducts from Adjusted EBITDAX depreciation, depletion, and amortization, accretion on asset retirement obligations, exploration expenses, interest expense, stock-based compensation, merger and acquisition costs and adjusted income tax expense.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are useful because they allow the Company to more effectively evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the Company's industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance, such as Company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company's computations of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income to the GAAP financial measure of net income.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDAX\nThree Months Ended (in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net income $ 89,573 $ 140,786 $ 38,934 Interest expense 22,503 22,174 19,224 Income tax expense (benefit) 21,932 (153,450 ) 15,072 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 76,122 77,159 61,040 Asset retirement obligation accretion 205 151 153 Exploration expenses 246 825 2,580 Merger and acquisition costs 2,757 42 4,052 Impairments of oil and natural gas properties 4,200 52,935 125 (Gain) loss on derivative instruments (2,907 ) 46,968 (17,121 ) Net settled derivative instruments (13,717 ) (8,566 ) (2,812 ) Stock-based compensation 5,327 4,422 3,924 Other income, net (1,039 ) (1,021 ) (720 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 205,202 $ 182,425 $ 124,451 Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income\nThree Months Ended (in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net income $ 89,573 $ 140,786 $ 38,934 Merger and acquisition costs 2,757 42 4,052 Impairments of oil and natural gas properties 4,200 52,935 125 (Gain) loss on derivative instruments (2,907 ) 46,968 (17,121 ) Net settled derivative instruments (13,717 ) (8,566 ) (2,812 ) Other income, net (1,039 ) (1,021 ) (720 ) Adjustment to income taxes for above items 166 (181,022 ) 1,754 Adjusted Net Income $ 79,033 $ 50,122 $ 24,212 Conference Call\nRSP will host a conference call for investors at 10:00 AM Central Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018, to discuss first quarter 2018 results.
