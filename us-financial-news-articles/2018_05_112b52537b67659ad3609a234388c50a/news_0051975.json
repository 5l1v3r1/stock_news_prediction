REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi/File Photo\nThe Caruana Galizia family declined to comment. They previously warned that the journalist’s sources could be compromised by handing over the laptops to Maltese authorities.\nIt was not clear why the family believed German involvement would protect sensitive information contained in her laptops.\nCaruana Galizia was killed in October last year by a car bomb believed to have been triggered by a mobile phone signal and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been helping Maltese authorities to solve the case.\nWidening international involvement in the murder case was revealed in a statement to Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper by Oliver Kuhn, a spokesman for its Federal Prosecutors’ Office. He said representatives of Galizia’s family had handed over the laptops and hard drives to German federal police “for distribution to the Maltese authorities”.\nMaltese detectives have been trying to obtain the laptops for their investigation into who ordered Caruana Galizia’s killing on Oct. 16 and why. Three local men have been charged with her murder. All deny the accusations.\nKuhn said Maltese legal authorities had been informed that German police were in possession of Caruana Galizia’s laptops and hard drives and it was for them to officially request access to or copies of the digital material. No inquiry into the laptops was being carried out in Germany, he said.\nA spokesman for the Maltese government had no immediate reaction.\nSince Caruana Galizia’s murder, Malta has come under pressure from European Union institutions, with an inquiry under way on its banking supervision and calls for investigations into the Mediterranean island country’s rule of law.
