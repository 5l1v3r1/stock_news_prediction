REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File Photo SoftBank ( 9984.T ) will sell its 20-plus percent stake as part of the deal, Bloomberg said, adding Google’s parent Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ) was likely to participate in the investment with Walmart.\nA final close of the deal is expected within 10 days, although deal terms could still change and a deal isn’t certain, Bloomberg reported.\nFlipkart and Alphabet did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment.\nEarlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported that Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) has made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart. Amazon, which is Flipkart’s biggest rival in India, declined to comment on that report.\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T11:28:09.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
