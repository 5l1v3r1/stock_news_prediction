The new system adds important features to the companyâ€™s first product, which was cleared by the FDA in May, 2017, with the indication to cool patients using its patented anatomically-targeted temperature regulation pads.\nThe IQool Warm System is a next-generation precision surface temperature regulation system intended for temperature management with a focus on three independent anatomical zones: head/neck, thigh and torso. The IQool Warm System quickly and effectively regulates body temperature in adult patients when clinically indicated using easy-to-apply non-stick adhesive pads prefilled with BCCOOL TM (a non-toxic and bacteriostatic cooling agent) that are attached to an automated temperature control unit. The IQool Warm System engages within seconds, allowing clinicians in a variety of settings to manage patient temperature quickly and effectively.\nBrainCool CEO Martin Waleij commented, \"We are very pleased to be moving into new clinical applications of our IQool System in the US to combine cooling and warming of patients quickly and effectively. The implementation of the warming function is essential to offset cooling when reaching target temperature quickly, and maintaining target temperature within narrow limits over time. The cooling process may be enhanced and the added effective warming component aims to add precision to temperature management.\n\"In addition to this new FDA clearance, we expect to present data for the product from an evaluation in Sweden and Germany at US scientific meetings this fall. Within the business area of brain cooling, BrainCool is collaborating with European researchers on our proprietary RhinoChill-system, which is currently CE-marked. We anticipate results in late 2018 and hope to be able to deliver this mobile cooling system to the US market soon.\"\nBased in Lund, Sweden, Europe, BrainCool AB (publ) (AktieTorget: BRAIN) is a publicly traded medical device company focused on next-generation temperature management systems. The technology platform both cools and warms patients using focused anatomical zones as opposed to whole body applications such as cooling blankets. BrainCool advances the temperature management standard of care by delivering a physically-targeted, speed-driven temperature management system designed to be easy to use and effective. The company currently markets a number of CE-marked devices in Europe addressing therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest and stroke (BrainCool TM and RhinoChill TM ), with products focused on traumatic brain injury and pain management (oncology and migraine) currently in development.\nThis information is information that BrainCool (publ) is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
