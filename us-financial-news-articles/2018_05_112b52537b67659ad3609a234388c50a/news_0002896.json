REUTERS/Mike Blake\nThe partnership was struck before Amazon bought rival specialty grocery Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion last summer. Amazon Prime Now had delivered from 15 of its 298 Sprouts stores.\n“The transition will impact comps for the next several quarters, but we remain very confident about growing our home delivery business as it brings a unique health and value proposition to our customers,” Chief Executive Amin Maredia said on a conference call with investors.\nSprouts will continue to deliver groceries through Instacart, a relationship it started at the beginning of the year, and expand that to its major markets.\nAmazon Prime Now provides free delivery, with some restrictions, for subscribers of Amazon’s $99 Prime service that also offers free video streaming and other perks. Instacart users in Los Angeles pay a delivery fee of $5.99 to $7.99 at Sprouts, or can choose to pay a $149 membership fee.\nSprouts also cut its full-year sales forecasts.\nIts new net sales forecast calls for growth in the range of 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent versus 11.5 percent to 12.5 percent previously.\nFor same-store sales, it forecast a rise of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent versus 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent previously.\nShares in Sprouts fell 13 percent to $21.22 shortly before the close of trading.
