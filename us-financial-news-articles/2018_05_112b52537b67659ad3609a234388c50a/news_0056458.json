It has about 150 million regular users per month and its games were downloaded about 300 million times last year.\nOne of its recent successes, Helix Jump, features a bouncing ball that has to progress through a helix tower labyrinth.\nThe terms of the deal with Goldman Sachs’ fund, West Street Capital Partners, were not disclosed. But the Voodoo’s two co-founders, Alexandre Yazdi and Laurent Ritter, will keep control over a majority of the shares, according to a statement.\n“It’s clearly a change of scale for us,” Yazdi told Reuters.\n“The challenge for us now will be to attract engineers and product managers who have artistic skills and a sensibility.”\nThe company, which only employs people in France, might build sales teams in the United States within two years to work more closely with Apple and Google, which both offer advertising and distribution tools, Yazdi said.\nVoodoo competes head-to-to head with Ubisoft’s Ketchapp, bought by the France’s biggest video game maker in 2014. Other rivals include Vivendi’s Gameloft.\nThe company is profitable and makes money through ads shown to its users. Users can, however, avoid watching them by paying a premium.\nGoldman Sachs’ investment vehicle is a new private equity fund that raised around $7 billion last year, people familiar with the matter have said.
