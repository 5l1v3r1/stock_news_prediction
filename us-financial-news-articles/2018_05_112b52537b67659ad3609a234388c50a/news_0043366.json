Tennis - ATP World Tour Masters 1000 - Italian Open - Foro Italico, Rome, Italy - May 18, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates after winning his quarter final match against Italy's Fabio Fognini REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\nDjokovic plotted a similar path to the Spanish claycourt king when the Serb lost the first set against Japan’s Kei Nishikori before recovering to win 2-6 6-1 6-3 and seal an open-era record 51st career meeting against Nadal.\nNadal started strongly and raced into a 4-1 lead but Fognini refused to surrender in front of a partisan Rome crowd, clawing a break back before running away with the set.\nThe Italian’s joy was short-lived, however, as Nadal regrouped, charging around the court and putting his opponent under relentless pressure as he took the second set to level things up.\nFognini was then hampered by an injury to his left knee as Nadal continued to fire on all cylinders and the Spaniard duly wrapped up the match in two hours and 14 minutes.

There’s a lot of positive things out of the match today.”\nDjokovic, who last met Nadal in the semi-finals of the 2017 Madrid Open, was on the back foot early against Nishikori as the Japanese baseliner capitalised on consecutive backhand errors to forge the first break.

This is what I was looking forward to. It’s what I was hoping to achieve.”\nMeanwhile, defending champion Alexander Zverev beat ninth seed David Goffin of Belgium 6-4 3-6 6-3 in the day’s final match to remain on course to defend his title after notching up a 12th consecutive victory.\nThe German, who is the form player on the ATP Tour, will battle Croatian Marin Cilic for a place in the final. Fourth seed Cilic pulled off a regulation 6-3 6-3 victory over Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta earlier in the day.
