A white woman named Delaney took the mic and then repeated the numerous N-words found in the “m.A.A.d City” lyrics, prompting Lamar to stop the music. Delaney, who had already shown a remarkable amount of confidence, seemed confused. “Aren’t I cool enough for you? What’s up, bro?”\nWhile fans boo’ed, Kendrick said, “you got to bleep one single word, though.”\nWho can or can’t say the N-word, particularly the version that appears in rap, continues to be a debate worth having evidently.\nLinguistics student Aliah Luckman, offered a terrific explanation as to why the word is problematic last spring, right around the time Bill Maher was forced to apologize for making a “house nigger” joke in a televised exchange with an utterly startled Senator Ben Sasse (R-Neb.)\nIn a tweet stream now shared more than 41,000 times, she explains in extraordinary detail how damaging the slur has always been, how the diminutive form “nigga” came to be, and how to assess when controversial words can be used:\n“[P]ragmatic competence is the ability to use language appropriately under various circumstances. These circumstances include the purpose for communicating, the relative status of those communicating, and the location of communication.”\nSo, even if Delaney’s black friend says it’s okay to say “my nigga” in their home, Delaney should not feel it’s okay to use the word at the mall. Or anyplace else. And if Delaney accidentally belts out the word performing a track in front of God, her neighbors, and Kendrick Lamar, she should apologize.\nWhen Delaney was confronted with her mistake, she apologized. “I was used to singing it like you wrote it,” she said. Pragmatic competence delayed, not deferred.\nLast fall, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates fielded the question of why white people can’t use the N-word during an event at Evanston Township High School in Illinois. His response was extraordinarily helpful.\nHe began by saying that it’s normal for certain subcultures to use terms that other people don’t, but this one word seems to pull people up short. “The question one must ask is why so many white people have difficulty extending things that are basic laws of how human beings interact to black people,” he said.\nIn other words, Why do you feel entitled to this word in either its vile or repurposed form?:\n“The experience of being a hip-hop fan and not being able to use the word ‘nigger’ is actually very, very insightful. It will give you just a little peek into the world of what it means to be black. Because to be black is to walk through the world and watch people doing things that you cannot do, that you can’t join in and do. So I think there’s actually a lot to be learned from refraining.”\nIt’s a fact that a fan named Rohan Ghosh seemed to grasp. Ghosh wowed the crowd immediately before Delaney but opted to move the mic away from his mouth at N-word time to avoid even the slightest chance that it would tumble out. All that time practicing alone in his room finally paid off.\nLamar gave Delaney a second chance, and she finished her performance N-word free.\n“ Be a Rohan, not a Delaney ,” said the crowd, driving the lesson home.\nClearly, refraining is a journey. One white raceAhead reader says that her young teen girls have taken to substituting the word “neighbor” when they rap along with their favorite stars. “It’s weird, but it works,” she says.\nIt is weird. But the pragmatic competence it shows is laudable.\nAlthough some words are not for everyone, redemption is. If you make a mistake, apologize, learn, and do better. Neighbor, we gon’ be alright . Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon’ be alright. On Point Stacey Abrams makes history as first black, female gubernatorial nominee The liberal Democrat handily defeated Stacey Evans to become the first black woman from a major party to be a nominee for governor in the state – and the U.S. (The deep South has not had an African American governor since Reconstruction, by the way.) She’s also a fascinating person, who has been candid about her life’s journey and the specific barriers she’s faced. “Race and gender play a major role in determining just how big of a financial disadvantage we’re likely to face,” she wrote in a candid essay for Fortune that touched on her personal debt and the burdens she faced supporting her parents and niece, the child of a younger brother struggling with addiction. “Even with a well-paid job, we often live paycheck to paycheck,” she says. Fortune Which mission-driven brands inspire consumers the most? The World Value Index is a fascinating mix of what resonates with consumers, and is based on how inspired they say they are with the missions of big companies, non-profits, and social movements. The St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital is number one, but Amazon — with its commitment to value and convenience — is in the top ten. #MeToo ranks higher than Chobani, Delta Airlines, and the Catholic Church, and Walmart ranks higher than Ben and Jerry’s. “[I]n the 21st century, the great brands will inspire people around something bigger than just consumption and will actually inspire people around the mission,” says the cofounder of the creative agency that created the report. So, it may surprise you to learn that the Ku Klux Klan made the list. This is not a drill. The Klan is on this list. The one with the sheets, that Klan. Fast Company Documents in Colin Kaepernick’s collusion case show that teams thought he was starter material According to Mike Florio of the NBC Sports show ProFootball Talk, “internal franchise documents generated as part of the free-agency evaluation process and testimony from witnesses harvested via depositions,” show that teams thought Kaepernick was good enough to be a starting quarterback for an NFL team. While coordination between teams may be hard to prove, it seems that talent isn’t the issue. “Which means that, at least as to Kaepernick, the notion that teams make decisions based only on trying to win football games doesn’t hold water,” says Florio. ProFootballTalk Sephora is launching in-store beauty classes for trans customers The free programs launch in June and will be hosted by trans and nonbinary Sephora make-up artists, known as “cast members.” The programming is part of their Classes for Confidence series which launched in 2016 and offers complimentary training for people in complex transitions, like workforce re-entry or cancer patients looking to reclaim their beauty. “This is the third curriculum we’ve rolled out, and we couldn’t be more excited,” Corrie Conrad, Head of Social Impact and Sustainability at Sephora tells Them. Conrad said it was one of the first programs they wanted to offer, but they wanted to “make sure we did it right.”", "external_links": ["https://theblast.com/kendrick-lamar-show-rohan-n-word-delaney-hangout-fest/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY", "https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/05/21/kaepernick-collusion-case-proving-that-teams-viewed-him-as-a-starting-quarterback/", "https://secure-web.cisco.com/1w2l8AwPwQxLgBc1OWzPlZHKh7Yh48vCtF9eUmwOA5zWZWqZ0UOXEVU7u_3U3zmYjUD9bDCtwtxpFnu-3wbTR1qdrX5OXKr3Xgn8kx_Do5nsmmEO74jkzhSu4nIZTHtGwdC4FHvRCFdZ4_CimVhFcYwrzC9w8FjHLvNXX3vHii9If1UTuvonCguPnhWf8wyntFywLXD7jYYAQbui1UahpdtBXHcIzFNeGQocb3SgElFuCPWS4Tk2eY9H37_OVt2DrHyMrr0_GRC8DYJp2jP4tDnsF9YDZT4LtNyi1agzjWuT-ad_au5-H0qXj5PGei-7kRB5UJxf8ffwp6xtog1KT4qINCBToI-gKZvxhq8Djhkg/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephorastands.com%2Fclasses_for_confidence%2F", "https://twitter.com/Luckwman/status/862280151358418944", "https://www.fastcompany.com/40576142/which-brands-inspire-consumers-the-most-with-their-missions", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO15S3WC9pg", "https://twitter.com/Rghoshy/status/998759933117173761", "https://twitter.com/search?q=be%20a%20Rohan%2C%20not%20a%20Delaney&src=typd", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/03/entertainment/bill-maher-racial-slur-sasse-interview/index.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-I3ElbPIkU", "http://enso.co/worldvalue", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/us/politics/georgia-primary-abrams-results.html"], "published": "2018-05-23T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:29:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
