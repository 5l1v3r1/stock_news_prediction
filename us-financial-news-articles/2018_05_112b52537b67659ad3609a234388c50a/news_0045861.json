A predator could have tracked your child’s cell phone to know when they were alone.”\nHe later praised the FCC decision to investigate, as first reported by Reuters.\n“I urge the FCC expand the scope of this investigation, and to more broadly probe the practice of third parties buying real-time location data on Americans,” Wyden said.\nRobert Xiao, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, said a flaw in a demo tool from LocationSmart could have been used to track anyone.\nLocationSmart spokeswoman Brenda Schafer said on Friday the vulnerability “has been resolved and the demo has been disabled.”\nPrior to Xiao’s efforts, which included locating up to two dozen users, Schafer said the company believes no one else exploited the vulnerability.\nThe company is committed to “continuous improvement of its information privacy and security measures,” she said.\nLast week, the New York Times reported that the former sheriff of Mississippi County, Missouri, used Securus Technologies [CASHAL.UL] to track mobile phones - including those of other police officers - without court orders, citing charges filed against him.\nSeveral published reports said Securus is getting its data through an intermediary of LocationSmart.\nVerizon spokesman Rich Young said Friday the company has “taken steps to ensure that Securus can no longer access location information about Verizon Wireless customers.” He added the company has “initiated a review of this entire issue.”\nAT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris said the company does not “permit sharing of location information without customer consent or a demand from law enforcement. If we learn that a vendor does not adhere to our policy we will take appropriate action.”\nSprint said it is conducting an internal review of the issue. T-Mobile US did not immediately comment.\nSecurus said later on Friday that access to location-based services “data has been disabled for the time being,” out of an abundance of caution and in light of ongoing discussions with partners.\nThe company also said it has “no direct business relationship with LocationSmart,” adding it is ready to work with law enforcement and vendors to reinstate the service as soon as possible.\nLast week Wyden said that Securus, a major provider of correctional facility telephone services, was purchasing real-time location information from carriers and providing information “via a self-service web portal for nothing more than the legal equivalent of a pinky promise.”\nWyden wrote all four of the U.S. major mobile carriers, saying the practice “exposes millions of Americans to potential abuse and unchecked surveillance by the government.”\nReporting by David Shepardson; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T04:08:22.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
