These employees’ regular schedule would be Sunday to Thursday or Tuesday to Saturday, avoiding costly overtime.\nUnder the current contract, most package-truck drivers work Monday to Friday shifts and earn higher wages on weekends. The union says they are entitled to double-time wages in some areas for working on a Sunday, or hourly rates of nearly $74.\nThe hybrid driver role would allow UPS UPS, +0.12% to start regular Sunday delivery of packages, a service the U.S. Postal Service provides for customers such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.98% UPS started Saturday package delivery in some markets in 2017 but hasn’t disclosed any plans to start delivering on Sundays.\nA Teamsters spokeswoman said the proposals between the union and UPS were part of the negotiating process and the two sides hadn’t come to any agreement about hybrid drivers. A UPS spokesman on Tuesday declined to comment on contract negotiations.", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ups-and-teamsters-discuss-adding-lower-paid-workers-for-weekend-deliveries-2018-05-09"], "published": "2018-05-10T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:35:16.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
