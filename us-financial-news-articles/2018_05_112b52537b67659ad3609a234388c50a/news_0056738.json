But I know it will be so much sweeter.”\nKendricks is the only major vaulter he has not defeated, the 18-year-old Duplantis said.\nThe world junior record holder added Lavillenie to his list on Friday.\nThe Frenchman, who had earlier said vaulting would be difficult because of the conditions, missed twice at 5.71 and then ran out of time on his third attempt. His only clearance was at 5.56 on his third try.\nBrazil’s Olympic champion Thiago Braz failed to clear a height.\nGermany’s Thomas Rohler, Johannes Vetter and Andreas Hofmann put on a clinic in the javelin with Rohler thrilling the crowd with a top throw of 89.88 meters.\nWorld champion Vetter had led with a best of 89.34 meters before Rohler’s winning throw.\nHofmann finished third with 86.45 meters.\n“It was great,” Vetter said of the sweep. “Hopefully we hold it through the rest of the season.”\nOn the track, Kenya’s Emmanuel Korir claimed the men’s 800 meters in 1:45.16, his fastest time of the year, as he outraced Nigel Amos of Botswana (1:45.51).\nEthiopia’s 18-year-old Selemon Barega took top honours in the infrequently run two miles, clocking 8:20.01.\nBarega held off American Olympic 5,000 meters silver medalist Paul Chelimo for the victory. Chelimo clocked 8:20.91.\nThe meeting continues on Saturday with world 60 meters record holder Christian Coleman makes his outdoor debut in the 100 meters.\nThe competition is last major event to be held at nearly 100-year-old Hayward Field before the facility is demolished to make way for a new stadium for the 2021 IAAF world championships.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T08:27:20.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
