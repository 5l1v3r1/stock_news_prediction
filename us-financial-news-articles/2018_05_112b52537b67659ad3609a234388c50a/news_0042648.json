An FSK representative, who did not comment on the talks, said any deal would need government approval.\nInterRAO, which owns thermal power plants in Russia among other assets, has said it does not plan a share buyback or the retirement of its quasi-treasury shares.\nInterRAO’s deal with Rushydro could take place this month or next, while a deal with FSK could take place at the end of June, one of the sources said.\nOne of the sources said that InterRAO’s main shareholder, state holding company Rosneftegaz, whose board is chaired by Igor Sechin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, would increase its indirect control of InterRAO.\nRosneftegaz owns 27.63 percent of InterRAO, with the company’s capitalization amounting to 415.5 billion roubles ($6.74 billion). The redemption at market price of 23.5 percent of shares could be worth some 97.6 billion roubles.\nIf the deals were to take place, Rosneftegaz, InterRAO Capital and companies close to them would control some 70 percent of the holding.\n“It will allow for better control of the process,” the source said.\n$1 = 61.6800 roubles Reporting by Anastasia Lyrchikova Writing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:27:04.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
