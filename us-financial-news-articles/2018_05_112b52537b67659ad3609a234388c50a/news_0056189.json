She wrapped it up in just 24 minutes as she mixed her powerful game with a couple of delicate dropshots.\nThe five-times Grand Slam champion broke early in the second set too, only for Hogenkamp to level for 3-3.\nAnother trade of breaks ensued and Hogenkamp broke again in the 10th game to level the match when Sharapova netted a backhand.\nThings then got much worse for Sharapova.\nShe peppered the court with unforced errors, falling 3-0 down in the decider as Hogenkamp bagged six games in a row.\nBut the double French Open champion’s never-say-die attitude resurfaced and she pocketed the remaining six games to set up a second-round meeting with Croatia’s Donna Vekic.
