Several networks said it was removing reruns of her show. Hulu said episodes of the new show would no longer be available on its streaming service.\nThe original \"Roseanne\" ran from 1988 to 1997, featuring a blue-collar family, the Conners, with overweight parents struggling to get by. It was praised for its realistic portrayal of working-class life.\nThe current \"Roseanne\" was ABC's biggest hit of the 2017-2018 season, drawing an average 18.7 million viewers, second only to CBS sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory,\" according to Nielsen data through May 20.
