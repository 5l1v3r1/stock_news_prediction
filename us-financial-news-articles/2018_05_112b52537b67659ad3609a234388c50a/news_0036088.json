Passengers also missed connecting flights and flights were delayed as a result.\nThe affected system contains information on aircraft positions, which is used to send ground staff to planes.\n“All this had to be carried out manually during the failure,” Lufthansa said, adding that it had to ask flight crews to use radios or telephones to state their position.\nFraport was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan Additional reporting by Ilona Wissenbach Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:58:15.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
