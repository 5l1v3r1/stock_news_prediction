The pact between OPEC, Russian and other producers has been implemented since January 2017.\nGazprom said its board of directors had agreed to sell 44 percent of its subsidiary Gazprom Neft-Vostok to Mubadala Petroleum, which is owned by the Mubadala fund in the United Arab Emirates.\nRussia’s Kommersant newspaper had reported talks on the deal in February, saying Gazprom Neft-Vostok produced oil at six fields in Western Siberia’s Omsk and Tomsk regions.\nThe Russian oil subsidiary’s combined production declined by 3 percent to 1.64 million tonnes in 2017.\nThe stake in Gazprom Neft-Vostok would be sold for at least $271 million, according to Gazprom. Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) acquired almost 5 percent.
