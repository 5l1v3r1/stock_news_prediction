Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nSince the first quarter ended on March 31, WTI crude oil has surged almost 9 percent to $70.70 a barrel, based on Friday's close. That level puts oil prices around 3 year-highs. ICE Brent oil , which settled at $77.02 a barrel, is seeing a similar pattern.\nKloza believes there's little to prevent Brent oil from reaching beyond the range of $80 a barrel. He suspected crude will trail behind Brent prices due to lower prices in the actual shale oil fields.\nNonetheless, the scenario screams higher prices at the pump.\nIn a note to CNBC, he wrote that \"we are seeing a quiet crisis that is leading to very expensive diesel and jet fuel prices. Refiners and producers are doing wonderfully — retailers of gasoline or restaurants and end-users BEWARE.\"\nHe estimated there's a 50-50 chance the nationwide average price for unleaded gasoline will exceed $3 a gallon this summer. That could put pressure on President Donald Trump.\n\"The President is not dumb, and he knows that when gasoline prices get above $3 a barrel a gallon, whoever is in charge in the Oval Office gets blamed,\" Kloza said. \"That will be an interesting thing to watch.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T23:54:54.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
