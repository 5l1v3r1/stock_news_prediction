But we have not yet found his name in our records,” an official at the Sorbonne told Reuters, adding staff would keep on searching through old written records.\nCambridge University declined to comment, but a source said they had not found any evidence he had studied there in September 2001, suggesting instead he might have attended a course run by a third-party in the grounds of Girton College.\n“DEFAMATORY CAMPAIGN” Conte himself made no public comment, but 5-Star issued two statements during the day to defend the professor, saying he had never specified what courses he had taken or claimed to have qualifications that he had not received.\n“Conte, like any researcher, went abroad to study, to deepen his knowledge, to perfect his English legal language skills,” the party said, adding that the Italian and international press were deliberately distorting Conte’s record.\n“The defamatory campaign is so explicit and crude that it will only strengthen us,” 5-Star added.\nPolitical opponents jumped on the saga to suggest that Conte was not up to running Italy.\n“If he didn’t study at NYU, what guarantees are there that the rest of the CV is right? To start with a lie is certainly not the best way to be presented to the head of state as a possible premier,” said Michele Anzaldi, a lawmaker with the centre-left Democratic Party.\n5-Star emerged as the largest party in elections on March 4, while a conservative coalition led by the League won the most seats. But both sides fell well short of an absolute majority, leading to months of political deadlock.\nA source close to Mattarella said the president had not yet decided how to proceed, adding that any problems that may arise over Conte’s candidacy were not the responsibility of the head of state — an apparent reference to the curriculum issue.\nItalian 10-year bond yields have risen nearly 70 basis points since the start of the month, while the cost of insuring against Italian government debt has hit 7-month highs.\nA partial recovery on Tuesday was checked by media reports that eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona was in the running to become economy minister in the new government.\nThe 81-year-old has often said European monetary union was a flawed project that had hurt Italy’s economy.\nLeague leader Matteo Salvini said later that Conte remained the party’s prime minister candidate and that he would like Savona to be economy minister.\nIn a book due for publication this month, Savona calls Italy’s entry in the euro zone a “historic error” and calls for a “plan B” to be drawn up to allow it to leave the currency bloc with as little damage as possible if it should prove necessary.\n“Savona’s background as a vocal critic of Europe’s construction make him the least market-friendly candidate,” Mizuho strategists told clients.\nFILE PHOTO: 5-Star Movement leader Di Maio shakes hands with Giuseppe Conte in Rome ahead of Italy's election, March 1, 2018.
