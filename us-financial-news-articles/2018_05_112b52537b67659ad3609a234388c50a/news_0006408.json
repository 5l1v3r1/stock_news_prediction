(NASDAQ:RTRX) today reported its first quarter 2018 financial results and provided a corporate update.\nThe Company recently obtained regulatory feedback from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the development pathway for sparsentan in IgA nephropathy (IgAN); a single registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial is expected to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2018 In April 2018, the Company announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the DUPLEX Study, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating sparsentan in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS); top-line data from the interim endpoint efficacy analysis are expected in the second half of 2020 Net product sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $38.4 million, compared to $33.6 million for the same period in 2017 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as of March 31, 2018, totaled $264.1 million\n“We made significant development advancements to start the year with our recent regulatory feedback on sparsentan’s development path in IgA nephropathy and the initiation of our pivotal Phase 3 DUPLEX Study in FSGS,” said Stephen Aselage, chief executive officer of Retrophin. “The prospect of running parallel registrational trials is exciting not just for us, but also for patients with FSGS and IgA nephropathy worldwide. We look forward to building upon our momentum in the clinic, as well as the continued growth of our commercial products to further our efforts in delivering life-changing therapies to patients living with rare diseases.”\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018\nNet product sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $38.4 million, compared to $33.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in net product sales is attributable to growth across the Company’s commercial products: Chenodal ® , Cholbam ® and Thiola ® . The Company continues to expect full year 2018 net product sales to be in the range of $170.0 to $180.0 million.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $24.6 million, compared to $20.9 million for the same period in 2017. The difference is largely attributable to support of non-clinical and clinical efforts related to fosmetpantotenate and sparsentan, as well as development funding to support the advancement of CNSA-001. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, R&D expenses were $23.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $18.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $26.5 million, compared to $23.1 million for the same period in 2017. The difference is largely attributable to an increase in headcount as a result of the Company’s operational growth, as well as marketing initiatives to support its commercial portfolio. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $19.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $14.5 million for the same period in 2017.\nTotal other expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.2 million, compared to total other income of $1.3 million for the same period in 2017. The difference is largely attributable to a change in accounting guidelines in which adjustments to the fair value of derivative instruments no longer impacts the net income or loss of the Company.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $18.4 million, or $0.46 per basic share, compared to $11.1 million, or $0.29 per basic share for the same period in 2017. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.6 million, or $0.14 per basic share, compared to net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per basic share for the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $264.1 million.\nProgram Updates\nFosmetpantotenate\nThe Company continues to enroll patients in the Phase 3 FORT Study, an international, registrational clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of fosmetpantotenate in approximately 82 patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) aged 6 to 65 years. The primary endpoint in the study is the change from baseline in the Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration Activities of Daily Living (PKAN-ADL) scale through 24 weeks of treatment. After completing the 24-week treatment period, all patients will be eligible to receive fosmetpantotenate as part of an open-label extension. The FORT Study is expected to be registration-enabling in the U.S. and Europe, and is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement, which indicates concurrence by the FDA that the design of the trial can adequately support the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA). The Company anticipates enrollment of pediatric patients to commence in the FORT Study during the second quarter of 2018, and completion of patient enrollment around year-end 2018. Top-line data are expected in the second half of 2019.\nFour PKAN patients receiving fosmetpantotenate for more than three years under physician-initiated treatment outside of the U.S. continue to receive therapy and remain stable.\nSparsentan\nIn April 2018, the Company announced the initiation of the pivotal Phase 3 DUPLEX Study, a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in approximately 300 patients with FSGS aged 8 to 75 years. The DUPLEX Study protocol provides for an unblinded analysis of at least 190 patients to be performed after 36 weeks of treatment to evaluate the interim efficacy endpoint – the proportion of patients achieving a modified partial remission of proteinuria [urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (Up/C) ≤1.5 g/g and a >40 percent reduction in Up/C from baseline] at Week 36. While the confirmatory primary endpoint of the study is the change in slope of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after 108 weeks of treatment, successful achievement of the 36-week interim efficacy endpoint is expected to serve as the basis for Subpart H accelerated approval in the U.S. and Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) consideration in Europe. Top-line data from the 36-week interim endpoint efficacy analysis are expected in the second half of 2020.\nThe Company recently received feedback from both the FDA and EMA indicating a single Phase 3 trial of sparsentan in IgAN could support registration in the U.S. and Europe. Study start-up activities are underway in anticipation of initiating a pivotal study in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCNSA-001\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the single ascending dose portion of the CNSA-001 Phase 1 study completed and the program advanced into the multiple ascending dose portion of the study. A Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) remains on track to commence in mid-2018, with results expected to be available in early 2019.\nThiola\nIn 2018, the Company expects an NDA to be filed for the new formulation of Thiola for the treatment of cystinuria. Pending approval, the Company expects to begin marketing the new formulation in 2019.\nConference Call Information\nRetrophin will host a conference call and webcast today, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss development updates as well as first quarter 2018 financial results.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and potential future results. They are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Retrophin’s management regularly uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate its business and make operating decisions. In addition, Retrophin believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures enhances the ability of investors to compare its results from period to period and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics the Company uses in making operating decisions.\nInvestors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. In addition, from time to time in the future the Company may exclude other items, or cease to exclude items that it has historically excluded, for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; because of the non-standardized definitions, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company in this press release and the accompanying tables may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by the Company’s competitors and other companies.\nAs used in this press release, (i) the historical non-GAAP net income (loss) measures exclude from GAAP net income (loss), as applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization and depreciation expense, revaluation of acquisition related contingent consideration, change in fair value of derivative instruments and income tax; (ii) the historical non-GAAP SG&A expense measures exclude from GAAP SG&A expenses, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense, and amortization and depreciation expense; (iii) the historical non-GAAP R&D expense measures exclude from GAAP R&D expenses, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense.\nAbout Retrophin\nRetrophin is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in identifying, developing and delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare diseases.
