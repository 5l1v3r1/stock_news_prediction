In the end, the dermatologists were only 86.6% accurate at diagnosing skin cancer, while the computer was able to diagnose issues with a 95% accuracy.\nThe 58 dermatologists involved in the study came from a variety of backgrounds and 17 countries. A little more than half were considered “expert” level with more than five years experience, while 19% had between two and five years of experience, and 29% had less than two years of work experience.
