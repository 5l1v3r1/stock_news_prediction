Realmuto and Starlin Castro homered to lead the Miami Marlins to a 6-3 win over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night at Marlins Park.\nOzzie Albies led Atlanta with a solo homer, a walk and two runs scored. His homer, No. 12 on the season, tied him at that moment for the National League lead with Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals.\nRealmuto, who went 3-for-5 and fell a triple short of what would’ve been the first cycle in Marlins history, homered on the first pitch in the bottom of the third inning. Castro homered on the second pitch in the bottom of the fifth.\nMiami shortstop Miguel Rojas went 3-for-4 as the Marlins, who are in last place in the National League East, snapped a four-game losing streak.\nDan Straily (1-0), who started the season on the disabled list, won his first game of the year. It was his third start of the season, and he allowed three hits, three walks and three runs, two earned. He struck out five and went past four innings for the first time this season.\nBrandon McCarthy (4-2) took the loss as Atlanta’s three-game win streak was snapped. Atlanta’s eight-game road win streak also ended.\nMcCarthy allowed 11 hits, two walks and six runs in five innings. In his past two starts, he has allowed 23 hits and 14 runs in 8 1/3 innings.\nMiami opened the scoring in the first. Leadoff batter Realmuto doubled down the third base line and came around to score on a groundout by Castro.\nAlbies tied the score in the third by pulling an inside, 91 mph fastball just inside the right field foul pole.\nTwo batters later, Realmuto pulled the first pitch of the bottom of the third for a homer down the left field line. Realmuto hit a 91 mph sinker for his fifth homer of the season.\nAtlanta tied the score 2-2 in the fourth on Ryan Flaherty’s bases-loaded walk. The run was unearned after Marlins first baseman Justin Bour couldn’t handle a hard ground ball that hit his glove, putting runners on first and third. Straily then hit Johan Camargo on a 1-2 pitch and lost Flaherty on a full-count slider. McCarthy ended the rally when his drive was caught on the warning track.\nMiami answered again in the bottom of the fourth, taking a 4-2 lead. Derek Dietrich singled, advanced to third on Rojas’ single and scored on Lewis Brinson’s chopper over Flaherty at third base. Realmuto’s RBI single past the mound capped the rally.\nAtlanta cut its deficit to 4-3 in the fifth. Albies drew a leadoff walk and scored from first on Nick Markakis’ two-out double to right.\nMiami quickly extended its lead to 6-3, responding to an Atlanta score with at least one run for the third consecutive inning. Castro hit his homer 427 feet to left-center, and the Marlins added an RBI single by Rojas to cap the inning.\nBrad Ziegler pitched a scoreless ninth for his fifth save of the season and No. 100 for his career.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-12T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:38:53.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
