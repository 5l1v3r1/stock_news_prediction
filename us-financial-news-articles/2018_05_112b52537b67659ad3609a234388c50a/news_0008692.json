The median progression-free survival had not been reached, with a median follow up of 6.6 months.

Company raises revenue guidance to $95-$115 million. Q1 revenues were $30.5 million, including $28.1 million in product sales.\nHENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NasdaqGS: SPPI), a biotechnology company with fully integrated commercial and drug development operations with a primary focus in hematology and oncology, announced today financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\n“We had a productive first quarter as we continued to advance our lead pipeline drugs poziotinib and ROLONTIS,” said Joe Turgeon, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. “We were honored to have poziotinib data appear in Nature Medicine, be presented at AACR, and announce our strengthened IP with MD Anderson in addition to releasing ROLONTIS topline data. In the next few months, we look forward to announcing important clinical data from both therapies at key scientific meetings.”\nClinical Program Update:\nPoziotinib, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor:\nThe company has initiated a multi-center study which is currently enrolling non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This trial will enroll up to 87 patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and up to 87 patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations at leading cancer centers throughout U.S. The study will evaluate objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), quality of life (QOL) and safety as additional endpoints. An investigator sponsored trial is ongoing at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in NSCLC patients with exon 20 mutations in EGFR or HER2. The 50 patient EGFR cohort is fully enrolled. In an April 2018 Nature Medicine publication, updated data from the first 11 NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations receiving poziotinib in MD Anderson’s Phase 2 clinical trial showed a confirmed objective response rate of 64 percent. As noted in the publication, the median progression-free survival had not been reached, with a median follow up of 6.6 months. The safety profile was consistent with those previously described for poziotinib and other TKIs. The company expects additional data from this study at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, in Toronto (September 23-26, 2018). Data presented at AACR in April 2018, demonstrated pre-clinical and early clinical activity of poziotinib in HER2 exon 20 mutant NSCLC, suggesting poziotinib could be a promising agent for the numerous cancer types driven by HER2 exon 20 mutations. The company is planning a basket trial to study poziotinib in exon 20 mutations across several solid tumors. The company has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with MD Anderson which strengthens and extends intellectual property on poziotinib. The filed patents, if granted, will extend until 2037.\nROLONTIS (eflapegrastim), a novel long-acting GCSF:\nA registrational Phase 3 study, ADVANCE, was initiated under a special protocol assessment with the FDA last year to evaluate ROLONTIS in the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The company announced the ADVANCE study met the primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferiority in duration of severe neutropenia between ROLONTIS and pegfilgrastim. The adverse event profile was similar between the two treatment arms. Phase 3 data abstract to be released by American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) followed by an oral presentation at Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) in June 2018. The company has completely enrolled RECOVER, an international Phase 3 study that has a design similar to ADVANCE. Spectrum is working toward a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA to ensure alignment in preparation for a planned Q4 BLA submission.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe company has also raised guidance for 2018. Expected 2018 revenue will be between $95 million to $115 million, up from previously projected revenue of $90 million to $110 million. Additionally, the company expects its current cash and marketable securities to be sufficient to fund operations into 2020.\nThree-Month Period Ended March 31, 2018 (All numbers are approximate)\nGAAP Results\nTotal product sales were $28.1 million in the first quarter of 2018.

Non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the tables of this press release and the accompanying footnotes. The non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude the items summarized in the below table. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results and that these items are not indicative of the company's on-going core operating performance.\nManagement uses non-GAAP net income (loss) in its evaluation of the company's core after-tax results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believes that these measures are important components of its internal performance measurement process. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to view the company's financial results in the way that management views the financial results.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented herein have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the company's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nSPECTRUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjustments for Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, expect per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (1 ) GAAP product sales, net & license fees and service revenue $ 30,495 $ 29,101 Non-GAAP adjustments to product sales, net & license fees and service revenue: (2,001 ) — Non-GAAP product sales, net & license fees and service revenue $ 28,494 $ 29,101 (2 ) GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses $ 24,104 $ 19,104 Non-GAAP adjustments to SG&A: Stock-based compensation (3,690 ) (3,238 ) Litigation expenses — (116 ) Depreciation expense (46 ) (90 ) Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative $ 20,368 $ 15,660 (3 ) GAAP research and development $ 17,895 $ 14,779 Non-GAAP adjustments to R&D: Stock-based compensation (787 ) (482 ) Depreciation expense (2 ) (3 ) Non-GAAP research and development $ 17,106 $ 14,294 (4 ) GAAP net loss $ (15,816 ) $ (23,547 ) Non-GAAP adjustments to net loss: Adjustments to product sales, net & license fees and service revenue, SG&A, and R&D as noted above 2,524 3,929 Amortization of intangible assets 6,947 6,889 Adjustments to other (expense) income (8,308 ) 1,573 Adjustments to benefit for income taxes 3 (201 ) Non-GAAP net loss $ (14,650 ) $ (11,357 ) (5 ) GAAP loss per share (Basic and Diluted) $ (0.16 ) $ (0.30 ) Non-GAAP loss per share (Basic and Diluted) $ (0.15 ) $ (0.14 ) Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic and Diluted 100,809,853 78,523,023 (1) Non-GAAP product sales, net & license fees and service revenue: These amounts reflect adjustments to reverse revenue recognition for upfront revenue from out-licenses and revenue from milestone achievement(s) that do not consistently recur. The resulting non-GAAP revenue solely consists of our (i) product sales, (ii) percentage-based royalties from our licensees’ sales, and (iii) on-going service revenue. We believe this measure of non-GAAP revenue is more indicative of the period-over-period success of our core ongoing product sales and service revenue.\n(2) Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative: These amounts reflect adjustments to reverse allocated operating expenses for certain non-cash items (including stock-based compensation and depreciation). We believe the resulting non-GAAP SG&A value is more indicative of the period-over-period success of our administrative expense control, and more reflective of our normalized SG&A expense trends.\n(3) Non-GAAP research and development: These amounts reflect adjustments to reverse allocated operating expenses for certain non-cash items (including stock-based compensation and depreciation), as well as non-recurring R&D milestone achievements that we record to expense for our in-licenses. We believe the resulting non-GAAP R&D value is more reflective of our true R&D expense trends.\n(4) Non-GAAP net loss: These amounts reflect all non-GAAP adjustments described in (1) through (3) above, plus other non-cash and/or non-recurring items, including: (i) adjustments to reverse sales milestone achievements; (ii) adjustments to reverse operating expenses for non-cash amortization and impairment of intangible assets (the reversal of these non-cash expenses allows for a clearer representation of the period-over-period success of our overall financial results and future working capital requirements); (iii) adjustments to reverse the impact of income taxes; (iv) adjustments to reverse the impact of mark-to-market contingent consideration (although our contingent consideration results from prior acquisitions and is a part of our business strategy, these adjustments through earnings typically result from variables other than our current commercial activity or other operating performance measures that are a focus of our management), (v) reversal of foreign exchange gains and losses (non-cash), (vi) reversal of debt discount accretion expense (non-cash) for our convertible notes, and (vii) reversal of the mark-to-market adjustment on our equity securities.\n(5) Non-GAAP loss per share: These amounts reflect all non-GAAP adjustments in (1) through (4) above to present our overall non-GAAP financial results for each period on a per-share basis.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006423/en/\nSpectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nShiv Kapoor\nVice President, Strategic Planning & Investor Relations\n702-835-6300\nInvestorRelations@sppirx.com\nSource: Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006423/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sppirx.com&esheet=51800957&newsitemid=20180503006423&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sppirx.com&index=1&md5=f0742ef84e8971b2242e01fd6b3bd303", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sppirx.com&esheet=51800957&newsitemid=20180503006423&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sppirx.com&index=2&md5=32f88d626d7d9e26c95bc44dfc03e8c8"], "published": "2018-05-04T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:50:22.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
