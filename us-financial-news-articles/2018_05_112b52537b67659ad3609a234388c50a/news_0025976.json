(PDL or the Company) (NASDAQ: PDLI) today reported first quarter ended March 31, 2018 including:\nTotal revenues of $38.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. GAAP diluted EPS of $0.01 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. GAAP net income attributable to PDL's shareholders of $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Non-GAAP net income attributable to PDL's shareholders of $13.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. A full reconciliation of all components of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial results can be found in Table 3 at the end of the release.\nRevenue Highlights\nTotal revenues of $38.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 included: Product revenues of $23.3 million, which consisted of $18.3 million from sales of Tekturna ® and Tekturna HCT ® in the United States, Rasilez ® and Rasilez HCT ® in the rest of the world (collectively, the Noden Products) and $5.0 million for product sales of the LENSAR ® Laser System; Net royalty payments from acquired royalty rights and a change in fair value of the royalty rights assets of $11.1 million, which consisted of the change in estimated fair value of our royalty right assets, primarily related to the Depomed royalty asset; Royalties from PDL's licensees to the Queen et al. patents of $2.8 million, which consisted of royalties earned on sales of Tysabri ® ; and Interest revenue from note receivable investment to CareView Communications of $0.7 million. Total revenues decreased by 15 percent or $6.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017. The evolution of our revenues reflects PDL's strategic shift to a specialty biopharmaceutical business model and the residual decline in royalty income from our expired Queen et al. patents. The 85 percent increase in product revenues was derived from the sales of the Noden Products and the LENSAR Laser System, the latter of which PDL did not begin to recognize until May 2017. Product revenues accounted for approximately 61 percent of total revenues compared to approximately 28 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Rasilez and Rasilez HCT revenues were $7.8 million, which was the first full quarter of revenue recognized from the ex-U.S. commercialization by Noden, having assumed commercialization from Novartis in November 2017; PDL received $18.6 million in net cash royalties from its royalty rights in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $13.5 million for the same period of 2017. The increase in cash royalties is mainly due to royalties from Glumetza ® sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., partially offset by the decrease of royalties from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as royalties ceased when the asset was sold in the first quarter of 2017; Royalties from PDL's licensees to the Queen et al. patents were 80 percent or $11.4 million lower than in the first quarter of 2017 as product supply of Tysabri ® manufactured prior to patent expiry in the United States have been extinguished and ex-U.S. product supplies are rapidly being exhausted; and The decrease in interest revenues was primarily due to the sale of the kaléo, Inc. note receivable in September 2017.\nOperating Expense Highlights\nOperating expenses were $34.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $26.9 million for the same period of 2017. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily a result of Noden Products and LENSAR contributing additional cost of product revenue of $5.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, which was the result of increased revenue and recognition of costs of goods for ex-U.S. revenue from Noden Products and increased revenue from LENSAR, which PDL did not begin to recognize until May 2017. Sales and marketing expenses at Noden and LENSAR increased an additional $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and research and development expenses increased an additional $0.6 million due to LENSAR clinical studies. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $2.0 million, a decrease in research and development costs for the completion of a pediatric trial for Tekturna and a decrease in general and administration asset management and legal expenses related to the Merck litigation.\nRecent Developments\nStock Repurchase Program\nFrom April 1, 2018 to May 8, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program at a weighted average price of $3.03 per share for a total of $8.4 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in March 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of its common stock for a total of $12.6 million. Approximately $12.4 million remains available under the current share repurchase program.\nOther Financial Highlights\nPDL had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and other investments of $405.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $532.1 million at December 31, 2017. The change in cash balance for the quarter was primarily a result of PDL retiring the remaining $126.4 million of principal of its 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 at their stated maturity by making a payment to the noteholders of $129.0 million, which included $2.6 million of accrued interest.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nPDL will hold a conference call to discuss financial results at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, May 9, 2018.\nTo access the live conference call via phone, please dial (800) 668-4132 from the United States and Canada or (224) 357-2196 internationally.

We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures provides our investors with additional information that reflects the amounts and financial basis upon which our management assesses and operates our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and are not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance performed in conformity with GAAP.\n\"Non-GAAP net income\" is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represent GAAP net income adjusted to exclude (1) mark-to market adjustments related to the fair value election for our investments in royalty rights presented in our earnings, which include the fair value re-measurement of future discounted cash flows for each of the royalty rights assets we have acquired, (2) non-cash interest revenue from notes receivable (3) stock-based compensation expense, (4) non-cash interest expense related to PDL debt offering costs, (5) mark-to market adjustments related to warrants held, (6) mark-to-market adjustment related to acquisition-related contingent considerations, (7) amortization of intangible assets, and to adjust (7) the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP financial measures used by PDL may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pdl-biopharma-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300645781.html\nSOURCE PDL BioPharma, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pdl-biopharma-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300645781.html"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:23:38.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
