(Nasdaq:CARA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pruritus and pain by selectively targeting peripheral kappa opioid receptors, today announced financial results and operational highlights for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“During the quarter, we were pleased with the progress made in building out our pruritus pipeline, headlined by the initiation of our pivotal U.S. Phase 3 trial of KORSUVA injection in hemodialysis patients with chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus,” said Derek Chalmers, Ph.D., D.Sc., President and Chief Executive Officer of Cara Therapeutics. “We look forward to the continued development of our other pruritus clinical programs, including Oral KORSUVA for the treatment of pruritus in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease and chronic liver disease patient populations, and will be reporting on the progress of these studies later this year. In addition, we have now completed enrollment in our adaptive Phase 3 trial in acute post-operative pain and expect to announce top-line data later this quarter.”\nFirst Quarter and Recent Developments:\nKORSUVA Injection: Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Pruritus (CKD-aP): Hemodialysis\nIn January 2018, the Company initiated the first pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial (KALM-1) of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in the United States for the treatment of CKD-aP in patients undergoing hemodialysis. In addition, the Company is conducting a 52-week Phase 3 safety study of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in patients undergoing hemodialysis with CKD-aP.\nOral KORSUVA: Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Pruritus (CKD-aP): Non-Hemodialysis\nThe open label, dose-escalating Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK), safety and tolerability trial continues to enroll moderate and severe CKD patients in escalating dose cohorts. Top-line data are expected in the second quarter of 2018.\nOral KORSUVA: Chronic Liver Disease-Associated Pruritus (CLD-aP)\nIn February 2018, the Company announced dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 PK and safety trial of Oral KORSUVA in patients with CLD. Data from this trial will inform the design/doses for the planned Phase 2 trial of Oral KORSUVA in patients with moderate-to-severe CLD-aP.\nI.V. CR845/Difelikefalin: Acute Post-Operative Pain\nEnrollment is complete in the adaptive Phase 3 trial of I.V. CR845 for the treatment of acute post-operative pain in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Data from this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2018.\nUpcoming Activities\nThe Company expects to make presentations at the following conferences through June 2018:\nInternational Investigative Dermatology Meeting, May 16-19, 2018 Jefferies 2018 Global Healthcare Conference, June 5-8, 2018 Cantor Dermatology & Aesthetics Summit, June 19, 2018\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet Loss: The Company reported a net loss of $16.8 million, or $0.51 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $22.2 million, or $0.81 per basic and diluted share, for the same quarter of 2017.\nRevenues: The Company did not recognize any revenue during the first quarter of 2018. Total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 was $911,000, which consisted of:\n(1) License and milestone fees revenue of $530,000 related to a sub-license fee earned from Maruishi Pharmaceuticals, or Maruishi, in connection with its sub-license agreement with Kissei Pharmaceuticals.\n(2) Collaborative revenue of $313,000 related to a sub-license fee earned from Maruishi; and\n(3) Clinical compound revenue of $68,000 from the sale of clinical compound to Maruishi.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $20.8 million in the same period of 2017. The lower R&D expenses in 2018 were principally due to a net decrease in direct clinical trial costs, which were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and payroll and related costs for R&D personnel.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $3.7 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.4 million in the same period of 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expense and payroll and related costs for G&A personnel.\nOther Income: Other income was $311,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $90,000 in the same period of 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to higher dividend and interest income resulting from a higher average balance of the Company’s portfolio of investments in the 2018 period.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Position: At March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $74.5 million compared to $92.6 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the balance of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily resulted from cash used in operations of $18.5 million, partially offset by proceeds of $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options.\nFinancial Guidance\nBased on timing expectations and projected costs for current clinical development plans, Cara expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities as of March 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures into the first half of 2019, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments under existing collaborations.\nConference Call\nCara management will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results and provide a business update.\nTo participate in the conference call, please dial 855-445-2816 (domestic) or 484-756-4300 (international) and refer to conference ID 1264618. A live webcast of the call can be accessed under \"Events and Presentations\" in the News & Investors section of the Company's website at www.CaraTherapeutics.com .\nAn archived webcast recording will be available on the Cara website beginning approximately two hours after the call.\nAbout Cara Therapeutics\nCara Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pruritus and pain by selectively targeting peripheral kappa opioid receptors (KORs). Cara is developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates, led by KORSUVA™ (CR845/difelikefalin), a first-in-class KOR agonist that targets the body's peripheral nervous system, as well as certain immune cells. In Phase 2 trials, KORSUVA injection has demonstrated statistically significant reductions in itch intensity and concomitant improvement in quality of life measures in hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) and is currently being investigated in Phase 3 trials in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP. Additionally, CR845/difelikefalin has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain, without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available opioid pain therapeutics.\nThe FDA has conditionally accepted KORSUVA™ as the trade name for difelikefalin injection. CR845/difelikefalin is an investigational drug product, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\nForward-looking Statements\nStatements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are \" \" within the meaning of the 1995.
