We are working closely with our customers and expect a more modest pricing environment as we target ongoing margin stability. We are well positioned to manage and pass on raw material headwinds.\n\"We continue to make progress on the construction phase of our complex Pori project. Our current estimate for the self-funded portion of the reconstruction and commissioning remains within the range of our previous guidance of $325 to $375 million.\"\nSegment Analysis for 1Q18 Compared to 1Q17\nTitanium Dioxide\nThe $71 million, or 18%, increase in revenues in our Titanium Dioxide segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to a 23% increase in average selling prices, a 10% improvement driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily against the Euro, partially offset by a 15% decrease in sales volumes. The increase in selling prices reflects continued improvement in business conditions for TiO 2 , allowing for an increase in prices globally. Sales volumes decreased primarily as a result of the fire at our Pori, Finland manufacturing facility and as a result of plant closures as part of our restructuring programs. Excluding the impact of the fire at our Pori plant and the impact of plants closed as part of our restructuring programs, sales volumes increased by 2%.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA of our Titanium Dioxide segment increased by $95 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This improvement was primarily a result of higher revenues, $7 million from the sale of carbon credits and $8 million of EBITDA benefit from our Business Improvement Program, partially offset by increases in raw material and other direct costs.\nPerformance Additives\nThe increase in revenues in our Performance Additives segment of $14 million, or 9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to a 7% increase in average selling prices, a 6% improvement driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 1% decrease in volumes and a 3% decrease due to less favorable mix and other. The improvement in selling prices was primarily in certain color pigment and functional additives product lines, where we raised prices to offset increases in raw material costs.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA in our Performance Additives segment increased by $3 million, or 14% compared to the same period in 2017, due to the increase in revenue and a $2 million increase due to savings from our Business Improvement Program, partially offset by increases in raw material costs.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and other represents expenses which are not allocated to our segments. Losses from Corporate and other were $10 million lower than the same period in the prior year as our costs to operate as a standalone company are lower than those costs historically allocated to us from Huntsman.\nUpdate on Pori\nCurrently, 20% of the site's prior total capacity is available for production. We are focused on restoring an additional 40% of capacity as quickly as possible to reach an aggregate 60% of former site capacity for manufacturing of our higher value specialty products. This reconstruction process entails a series of mechanical construction phases with a concurrent rolling commissioning. Subject to the pace of our progress during commissioning, we expect some of this additional capacity to be producing finished product during the second half of this year, and the remaining specialty capacity to be restored and producing finished product during 2019. Based on current market and economic conditions, associated costs and projected returns, we intend to rebuild the commodity production capacity of the facility, but do not currently expect it to produce product prior to 2020. We continue to estimate the self-funded portion of the reconstruction and commissioning remain within the range of our previous guidance of $325 to $375 million.\nTax Items\nWe recorded income tax expense of $20 million and income tax benefit of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We expect our adjusted long-term effective tax rate will be approximately 15% to 20%. We believe the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on our adjusted long-term effective tax rate will not be material, given the low percentage of our global pre-tax income earned in the United States. We expect our cash tax rate will be between 10% to 15%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $223 million compared with $238 million as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we have in place an undrawn asset based revolving credit facility available for our working capital needs and general corporate purposes with an available borrowing base of $263 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, net debt was $529 million compared to $519 million as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, capital expenditures, excluding Pori, were $20 million. We continue to expect total capital expenditures, excluding Pori, to be approximately $120 million in 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call Information\nWe will hold a conference call to discuss our first quarter 2018 results on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET.\nCall-in numbers for the conference call:\nU.S. participants\n1-866-807-9684\nInternational participants\n1-412-317-5415\n(No passcode required)\nIn order to facilitate the registration process, you may use the following link to pre-register for the conference call.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) from continuing operations, depreciation and amortization, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, after eliminating the following: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation expense, net; (c) net income of discontinued operations net of tax; (d) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (e) net plant incident (credits) costs; and (f) restructuring, impairment, plant closing and transition costs. We believe that net income (loss) is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. Finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. This can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nNevertheless, our management recognizes that there are limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of us as compared to net income. Our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than U.S. GAAP results alone.\nIn addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. For example, while EBITDA from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or future results.\nAdjusted net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation (gain) expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) (gain) loss on disposition of businesses/assets; (e) net income of discontinued operations; (f) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) net plant incident (credits) costs; (i) restructuring, impairment, plant closing and transition costs. Basic adjusted net earnings (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Adjusted diluted net earnings (loss) per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. For the periods prior to our IPO, the average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted adjusted net income per share was based on the ordinary shares that were outstanding at the time of our IPO. Adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information.\n(2)\nThe income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. We do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful information than is provided under U.S. GAAP.\n(3)\nManagement internally uses a free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate the Company's liquidity, (b) to evaluate strategic investments, (c) to evaluate the Company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations and used in investing activities. Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the Company's consolidated and combined statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. Free cash flow is presented as supplemental information.\nAbout Venator\nVenator is a global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that comprise a broad range of pigments and additives that bring color and vibrancy to buildings, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption.
