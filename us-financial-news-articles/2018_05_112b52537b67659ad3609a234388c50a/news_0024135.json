If political will joins substance, then things can happen - we have done our work on the substance,” he said, speaking at a briefing at think-tank Chatham House.\nEU and Polish officials have previously signalled that a potential compromise should be agreed before EU ministers are due to discuss the matter at a May 14 meeting.\nReporting by Ritvik Carvalho, writing by Karin Strohecker; editing by Sujata Rao\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:29:59.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
