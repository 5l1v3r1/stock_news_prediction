Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City vs Huddersfield Town - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - May 6, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and their players and staff celebrate winning the premier league title Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nFollowing a surprise 0-0 draw with Huddersfield Town on Sunday, maximum points from their final two games, at home to Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday and away at Southampton, would ensure the champions finish on exactly 100 points.\n“We cannot deny it would be nice to reach 100 (points),” City manager Pep Guardiola said.\n“We spoke about that. These targets help us to be focused.”\nNo side in England’s top flight have achieved this. Antonio Conte, the Chelsea manager, suggested back in 2016 that a 100-point season was an impossible feat.\nYet perfectionist Guardiola will be irritated if their majestic campaign is not rewarded with a three-figure flourish, even though he concedes it will be mighty difficult, especially with Southampton fighting for their Premier League lives on Sunday.\nAgainst Brighton, who can relax after winning their fight for survival, the Etihad faithful will be expecting normal service to be resumed, with City needing a win to move to 97 points, two more than Chelsea’s landmark of 95 in 2004-05.\nTwo more goals would also see City’s total for the season surpass Chelsea’s record of 2009-10, when Didier Drogba spearheaded a tally of 103.\nThe Wednesday action also sees the resumption of the battle between City’s distant pursuers to guarantee Champions League football next season.\nTottenham Hotspur can move third on 74 points, leapfrogging Liverpool by two points if they beat Newcastle United at Wembley.\n“It is in our hands to finish third,” Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said.\nThe Argentine was disappointed with Spurs’ last-gasp 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday — the first time they have failed to score in 24 league matches — which has left the door ajar for Chelsea in the top-four race.\nChelsea, fifth on 69 points, would jump into fourth by beating struggling Huddersfield on Wednesday and Spurs lose to Rafa Benitez’s side.\nShould Huddersfield lose, their Premier League fate would go down to the wire when they host Arsenal in Arsene Wenger’s final game in charge of the Gunners.
