It's billed as a \"proof-of-process\" tunnel in the company's large-scale plans for reducing transportation congestion and travel times.\nThe company is also working on projects along the East Coast and in Chicago.\nThe tunnels will eventually be a paid alternative to buses or subways. The Instagram video, posted around 11 p.m. ET Thursday, had garnered 1.8 million views within 10 hours.\nWATCH: Elon Musk's big ambitions may be killing Tesla show chapters Tesla's earnings were better than expected, but Elon Musk still has a lot on his plate 8:48 PM ET Wed, 2 May 2018 | 05:31", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BinoVT6Acpd/"], "published": "2018-05-11T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:18:30.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
