Ukrainian authorities released a drawing of the man they suspect is Babchenko's assassin, around 40-45 years old, with a grey beard and wearing a cap.\nTwo years ago Pavel Sheremet, a Belarussian journalist known for his criticism of his home country's leadership and his friendship with the slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, was blown up in a car bomb in central Kiev.\n\"Putin's regime takes aim at those who cannot be broken or intimidated,\" Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker and adviser to the interior minister, wrote on Facebook.\nBabchenko's house had run out of bread and he had gone to the shops to buy some, Gerashchenko said.

He then he became a war reporter for several Russian newspapers. On Feb. 27 last year, he wrote on Facebook that he had left Russia.\nHe reported on Russia sending private military contractors to Syria and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in July 2014 in eastern Ukraine, for which investigators last week held the Russian state responsible.\nRussian authorities again denied any connection with the plane's downing over an area of Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatist forces.\nIn his last Facebook post before he was killed, Babchenko recalled an incident four years ago when he was meant to fly in a Ukrainian military helicopter in Ukraine's embattled Donbass region. The helicopter was overloaded and he was not permitted to fly. It was shot down and 14 people on board were killed.\n\"And I was lucky.
