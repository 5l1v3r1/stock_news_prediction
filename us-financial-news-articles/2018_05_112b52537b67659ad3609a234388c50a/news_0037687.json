Balotelli has not been called up by Italy since the 2014 World Cup.\nMancini, a gifted forward in his playing days, won a surprisingly modest 36 caps for Italy and never played at a World Cup, although he was an unused member of the 1990 squad.\nHe began his coaching career with Fiorentina in 2001 and won the Coppa Italia in his first season even though the club was plagued by financial problems.\nHe then moved to Lazio but had his biggest success at Inter Milan where he won three successive Serie A titles.\nThat was followed by a stint at big-spending Manchester City where he won one English Premier League and one FA Cup title in four seasons.\nSince then, he has coached at Galatasaray, had another less successful spell at Inter and finally a season at Zenit.\nAt one point, he criticized predecessor Antonio Conte for calling up naturalized players such as Brazilian-born Eder and Argentine-born Franco Vazquez.\nWriting by Brian Homewood in Bern; editing by Pritha Sarkar\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
