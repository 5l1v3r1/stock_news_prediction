The only outlier so far is Mitsubishi Motors, which sees a rise in operating profit despite a stronger yen.\nToyota is targeting total group sales of a record 10.5 million vehicles globally in the year to March, versus 10.44 million last year, led by strength in Asia.\nIt expects sales in Asia to rise 8.2 percent to 1.67 million units, while it sees sales in North America, its biggest market, dropping slightly to 2.8 million units.\nIn North America, Toyota and its domestic rivals are grappling with intense competition and falling demand for sedans, a mainstay of Japanese automakers in the region, amid an overall slowdown in the world's second-biggest auto market.\nNorth America remains \"challenging\", senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi said, adding the company planned to keep vehicle discounts, a major cost to the company, at current levels or lower them this year.\nShares in Toyota reversed early losses to close up 3.8 percent on Wednesday, buoyed partly by a company plan to buy back shares worth up to 300 billion yen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T07:59:00.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
