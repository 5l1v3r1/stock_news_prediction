[NYSE:LM], today announced that it has sent the following letter to the Board of Directors of athenahealth Inc.\nMr. Jeff Immelt\nMr. Brandon Hull\nMs. Jacqueline Kosecoff\nMr. Brian McKeon\nathenahealth Inc.\n311 Arsenal Street\nWatertown, MA 02472\nMay 30, 2018\nDear Members of the athenahealth Inc. Board:\nOur thanks are extended to members of the Board of Directors for their frank conversation on Monday, May 21. We are pleased that the Board is committed to driving sound corporate governance, organizational improvement and maximizing value for all shareholders.\nAs we discussed, ClearBridge Investments has been a long-term investor in athenahealth since early 2010. We've believed in the opportunity to disrupt the health care information technology industry and eventually generate attractive profitability metrics.\nThe litany of executive turnover, misexecution on several initiatives and persistent downward trajectory of a variety of financial measures suggests that a different mindset may be best to guide the business prospectively.\nWe acknowledge that the Board began to take measures last summer to scrutinize the business from all angles and improve execution. We further believe it is essential to continue that effort to its fullest logical outcome. We urge the Board of Directors to instruct its financial advisors, Lazard and Centerview Partners, to commence a formal solicitation process including all potential strategic and financial suitors.\nIn light of the public proposal to take athenahealth private by Elliott Management, ClearBridge Investments strongly encourages the Board of Directors to fully exercise its fiduciary responsibility to represent all of the company's shareholders.\nWe would be happy to make ourselves available should you wish to discuss this further. Thank you for your consideration and prompt action.\nRespectfully,\nBrian Angerame\nDerek Deutsch, CFA\nAram Green\nJeffrey Russell, CFA\nAbout ClearBridge Investments\nClearBridge Investments is a leading global equity manager with $135.3 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2018.
