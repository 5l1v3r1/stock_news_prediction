Photo: SAUL LOEBSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty\nExecutives are less optimistic about the U.S. economy and their own company’s prospects, according to the second-quarter economic outlook survey by the American Institute of CPAs released Thursday.\nThe share of executives that are upbeat about the economy fell to 74%, down five percentage points from last quarter, amid concerns about trade and political uncertainty. Optimism about their own company’s outlook fell one percentage point to 70%, according to the survey of 831 certified public accountants that hold various leadership positions at their companies, including chief financial officer or controller.\nThe uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs is partly behind a more sober business outlook this quarter, said Joselin Martin, finance chief at plasterwork contractor Hayles & Howe Inc. The company, which helped restore the ceiling at Union Station in Washington D.C. among other historical buildings, imports many of its material even though its main cost is labor, she said.\n“When we’re estimating jobs now, we have put in either a worst-case or some sort of cushion so that if the tariffs do go ahead we can still afford the job,” Ms. Martin said. “It’s hard to plan when you don’t know maybe some major decisions will be made.”\nProfit growth estimates slipped to 4% from 4.4% in the first quarter, while revenue growth forecasts eased to 4.8% from 5%.\nStill, the share of businesses who said they planned to hire immediately rose to 30% from 27%. However, the availability of skilled workers remained the top challenge for companies for the fourth quarter in a row.\n“Despite their more tempered views on growth, business executives still see a strong hiring picture over the next year,” said Arleen Thomas, a managing director at the AICPA, in a statement. “Labor market tightness continues to be a concern, with companies encountering difficulty in recruiting candidates with the right skills.”\nShare this: business outlook ECONOMY Previous CFO Moves: Diago, Essentra, HP, Advance Publications, [24]7.ai and RBS Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Executive Transitions: Your Team Is Your Brand Incoming executives are usually hired to improve performance and drive change, not to maintain the status quo.
