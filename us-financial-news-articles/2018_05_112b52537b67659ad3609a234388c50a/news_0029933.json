Alexander Nemenov/Pool via REUTERS\nIn Kiev, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: “The illegal construction of the Kerch bridge is the latest evidence of the Kremlin’s disregard for international law.\n“It is particularly cynical that its opening is happening on the eve of the latest anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean-Tatar people by the Stalin regime.” Slideshow (2 Images)\nRussia annexed Crimea from neighbouring Ukraine in 2014, drawing sanctions and prompting a sharp deterioration in ties with the West. But many in Russia saw the move as restoring Moscow’s rule over a historically Russian region.\nBuilt at a cost of 223 billion roubles ($3.60 billion), the bridge is set to be the longest dual-purpose span in Europe.\nThe Kremlin said the bridge would be opened to cars on Wednesday. The rail section was due to be completed at the end of 2019.\n“Putin initiated this project himself. Many didn’t believe these plans were possible,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday ahead of the ceremony.\n“This is an extremely important day from this point of view and in a practical sense and in symbolic terms.” Reporting by Gleb Stolyarov; Editing by Richard Balmforth", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:11:52.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
