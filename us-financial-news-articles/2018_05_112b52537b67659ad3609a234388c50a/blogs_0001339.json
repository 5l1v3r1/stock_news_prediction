Shares of the tech giant are down 2.4 percent, while the S&P 500 is down 1 percent and the tech sector is up more than 3 percent this year.\nWorth noted that Apple's underperformance is a rather rare occurrence. For only eight of the past 36 years, Apple stock was down while the tech sector was up in the January to April period, Worth said.\nEven more importantly is how Apple stock performed following those periods of underperformance, said Worth. In the week following, the stock rose nearly 4 percent; in the two weeks following, the stock jumped 8 percent; in the three weeks following, it surged 11 percent. Furthermore, the odds that the stock rises ranges from 57 percent to 85 percent.\n\"I'm going to make the bet that Monday's action alone [in Apple] was very bullish in the context of a bad tape is a tell that Apple might just be defensive,\" Worth said.\nMoreover, \"Apple has made no progress. It's dead even with the market for three years. So we can't consider it a runaway stock or expensive,\" Worth added. \"I'm going to make the bet that we bounce in response to earnings.\"\nAnalysts polled by FactSet are expecting Apple to report earnings of $2.69 per share on $61 billion in revenue.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
