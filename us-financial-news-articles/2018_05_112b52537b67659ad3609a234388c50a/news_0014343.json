(NYSE American:RNN), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative, targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Rexahn had a strong start to 2018, with the presentation of encouraging data on RX-3117 in metastatic pancreatic cancer and advanced bladder cancer and the announced collaboration with Haichang to develop RX-0201 for hepatocellular carcinoma,” said Peter D. Suzdak, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Rexahn. “We look forward to the continued clinical advancement of RX-3117 and RX-5902 and we will be presenting data on these programs in June at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. These data will include interim data from the Phase 2a trials of RX-3117 in advanced bladder cancer patients and of RX-5902 in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. We also look forward to presenting data later this year on the ongoing Phase 2a trial of RX-3117 in combination with Abraxane ® in newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.”\nRecent Highlights:\nThe European Commission granted Orphan Drug Designation for RX-3117 in pancreatic cancer in January 2018. Presented data from the Phase 2a clinical trial of RX-3117 in metastatic pancreatic cancer at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers 2018 Annual Meeting. Of the 43 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 31% had disease stabilization for two months or more and 12% had disease stabilization for greater than four months. Presented data from the Phase 2a clinical trial of RX-3117 in advanced bladder cancer at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers 2018 Annual Meeting. Encouraging progression-free survival and evidence of tumor shrinkage (including one patient with a partial response) were observed in patients with advanced bladder cancer who had failed on multiple prior treatments including immunotherapy and gemcitabine. Received notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in January 2018 for a new U.S. patent covering the Use of RX-5902. The allowed Patent Application No. 15/255,901, “Quinoxalinyl Piperazinamide Methods of Use,” covers the use of RX-5902 for the treatment of cancers including triple-negative breast cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor agents such as cytotoxic agents or immune checkpoint inhibitors. The allowed application will extend the patent protection for uses claimed under this patent until 2036. Entered into a research and development collaboration with Zhejiang Haichang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Haichang) for the development of RX-0201. Under the agreement, Haichang will develop a nano-liposomal formulation of RX-0201 using its proprietary QTsome™ technology and conduct certain preclinical and clinical activities through completion of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Presented preclinical data at the American Association of Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2018 demonstrating that RX-3117 promotes epigenetic effects in cancer cells through enhanced degradation of DNA methyltransferase 1. Enhanced leadership team by appointing Douglas J. Swirsky as President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary in January 2018. As of May 4, 2018, had $19.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments (unaudited). Rexahn expects that its cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund the company’s currently expected cash flow requirements for its activities into mid-2019.\nQ1 2018 Financial Results:\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in research and development is primarily attributable to increases in drug manufacturing costs and clinical trial costs from the advancement of our clinical trials.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $1.8 million, compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses.\nNet Loss: Rexahn’s loss from operations was $5.9 million and $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Rexahn's net loss was $2.1 million, or $0.07 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $21.6 million, or $0.91 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Included in the net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is a non-cash charge of $17.7 million due to an adjustment to the fair value of outstanding warrants primarily resulting from the increased stock price of the underlying common stock, as compared to a non-cash gain of $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAbout Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nRexahn Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NYSE American:RNN) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing novel, targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The company's mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by developing next-generation cancer therapies that are designed to maximize efficacy while minimizing the toxicity and side effects traditionally associated with cancer treatment. Rexahn's product candidates work by targeting and neutralizing specific proteins believed to be involved in the complex biological cascade that leads to cancer cell growth. Preclinical studies show that certain of Rexahn's product candidates may be effective against multiple types of cancer, including drug resistant cancers, and difficult-to-treat cancers, and others may augment the effectiveness of current FDA-approved cancer treatments. The Company has two oncology product candidates, RX-3117 and RX-5902, in Phase 2 clinical development and additional compounds in preclinical development including RX-0201.
