Moskowitz says Hickey violated state laws against short-term renting and profiting off rent-stabilized apartments.\nHickey says the Airbnb rentals spanned 85 nights over 10 months a few years ago. She says she needed money for her then-husband's medical bills and believed the rentals were legal.\nThe 72-year-old also owns a Manhattan condo. She says she uses it as an office.\nSan Francisco-based Airbnb said Friday it encourages tenants to consult their landlords before renting out their homes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:06:05.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
