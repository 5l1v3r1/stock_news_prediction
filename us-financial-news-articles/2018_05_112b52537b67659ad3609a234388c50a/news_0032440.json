Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n“They’re playing tougher than we are,’ Lue said of the physicality in the series. “We see that. They’re being physical, they’re gooning the game up and we gotta do the same thing.”\nLue made the comments after Tuesday night’s Game 2, a 107-94 Celtics win.\nThe Celtics didn’t seem to mind Lue’s assessment.\nBoston forward Marcus Morris, who has frequently drawn the assignment of guarding LeBron James, somewhat agreed.\n“Gooning? That’s a good word,” Morris said. “(Expletive) we’re doing what it takes. Whatever it takes, every player, 1 to 15, whatever it takes, that’s what we’re doing. You call it what you want to call it. We’re just trying to get the win.”\n“I don’t even know what to say to that,” said Jaylen Brown of Lue’s comment. “I agree, I guess.”\nOddly enough, it’s Cleveland guard JR Smith who drew criticism for borderline dirty play.

I think we’ve got to be physical, and we’ve got to have a physical mindset, you know, that they’re coming in, playing tough. They’re aggressive, and we’ve got to match that.”\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:52:45.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
