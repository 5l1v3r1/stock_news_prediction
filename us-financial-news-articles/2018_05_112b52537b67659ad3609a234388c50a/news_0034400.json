EDT\nHOUSTON, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vertex Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VTNR), a specialty refiner of alternative feedstocks and marketer of high-purity petroleum products, announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 2018\nConsolidated revenue increased 19% to $41.4 million, compared to $34.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit was up 67% to $6.8 million compared to 11.7% for the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit margin was 16.4%. Total overall volume rose 1%, compared to the prior year’s period. Consolidated per barrel margin increased 65% for the first quarter of 2018 over the same period a year ago. Collected volume grew 17% for the first quarter of 2018 over the first quarter of 2017.

Cowart, Chairman and CEO of Vertex Energy, Inc., stated, \"Overall, we are pleased with the state of our business operations. We managed to hit or surpass many of our internal targets. However, we are not happy with our EBITDA and net income results, which were negatively affected by a heater problem at our Heartland facility and an extended turnaround down time at our Marrero facility. Both of our facilities are now fully operational.\"\nMr. Cowart added, \"Despite the negative impact on our production, there was strong demand for our finished products. We witnessed an improvement in our revenues, gross profit, and gross profit margins. In addition, we managed to protect our spreads by maintaining our charge-for-oil for collected volume. We have recaptured our production capacity and plan to continue to make adjustments at our facilities as necessary in an effort to yield a significant improvement in production volume and our financial performance for 2018.\"\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS CONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nManagement will host a conference call today at 9 A.M.

These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.\nEBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before unrealized losses (gains) on derivative contracts and stock-based compensation expense. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they provide additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently than Vertex Energy does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nVERTEX ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(UNAUDITED) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 ASSETS Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 52,876 $ 1,105,787 Accounts receivable, net 11,237,297 11,288,991 Federal income tax receivable 274,423 — Inventory 8,112,625 6,304,842 Prepaid expenses 2,635,727 1,771,832 Total current assets 22,312,948 20,471,452 Noncurrent assets Fixed assets, at cost 65,541,421 65,237,652 Less accumulated depreciation (17,673,342 ) (16,617,824 ) Fixed assets, net 47,868,079 48,619,828 Goodwill and other intangible assets, net 14,047,119 14,499,354 Deferred tax asset — 274,423 Other assets 492,417 440,417 TOTAL ASSETS $ 84,720,563 $ 84,305,474 LIABILITIES, TEMPORARY EQUITY, AND EQUITY Current liabilities Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 11,465,453 $ 10,318,738 Dividends payable 554,917 420,713 Capital leases-current 9,698 — Current portion of long-term debt, net of unamortized finance costs 1,158,196 1,616,926 Derivative liability 466,828 — Revolving note 4,239,388 4,591,527 Total current liabilities 17,894,480 16,947,904 Long-term liabilities Long-term debt, net of unamortized finance costs 14,744,333 13,531,179 Capital leases-long-term 19,923 Contingent consideration 236,680 236,680 Derivative liability 2,677,159 2,245,408 Total liabilities 35,572,575 32,961,171 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Note 3) — — TEMPORARY EQUITY Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share;\n10,000,000 shares designated, 3,479,016 and 3,427,597 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017,\nrespectively with a liquidation preference of $10,784,950 and $10,625,551 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 7,583,722 7,190,467 Series B1 Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share;\n17,000,000 shares designated, 12,947,916 and 13,151,989 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017,\nrespectively, with a liquidation preference of $20,198,749 and $20,517,103 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 15,659,226 15,769,478 Total Temporary Equity 23,242,948 22,959,945 EQUITY 50,000,000 Preferred shares authorized: Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value;\n5,000,000 shares designated, 453,567 and 453,567 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017,\nrespectively, with a liquidation preference of $675,815 and $675,815 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 454 454 Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value;\n44,000 shares designated, 31,568 and 31,568 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017,\nrespectively, with a liquidation preference of $3,156,800 and $3,156,800 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 32 32 Common stock, $0.001 par value per share;\n750,000,000 shares authorized;
