Solid organic revenue growth reflects our focus on the top line. At Stantec, we’ve leveraged our solid client relationships and local expertise around the world to secure more projects across our business operating units. In fact, we have now seen four consecutive quarters of overall gross and net organic revenue growth.\n“Acquiring and fully integrating firms expands our presence and capabilities in key geographies and sectors. As part of this strategy, we completed two important acquisitions this quarter: ESI Limited, which builds on our environmental services consulting business in the United Kingdom; and Occam Engineers Incorporated, which adds to our water, transportation, and public works capabilities in the southwestern United States.\n“In 2018, our management team is focused on making key improvements to project execution oversight, employee utilization, cost effectiveness and continuing to maintain our strong client relationships. This quarter shows the positive results of our actions.”\nQ1 2018 Summary of Results\nQuarter Ended March 31 2018 2017 Change % Increase (in millions of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts and percentages) $ $ $ Gross revenue 1,281.7 1,276.3 5.4 0.4 % Net revenue 876.6 870.8 5.8 0.7 % EBITDA (note) 90.3 89.7 0.6 0.7 % Adjusted EBITDA (note) 90.4 89.9 0.5 0.6 % Net income 36.8 (58.0) 94.8 163.4 % Adjusted net income (note)\n47.8 45.8 2.0 4.4 % EPS - basic 0.32 (0.51) 0.83 162.7 % EPS - diluted 0.32 (0.51) 0.83 162.7 % Adjusted EPS - basic (note) 0.42 0.40 0.02 5.0 % Adjusted EPS - diluted (note) 0.42 0.40 0.02 5.0 % Dividends declared per common share 0.1375 0.1250 0.0125 10.0 % note: EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are non-IFRS measures (discussed in the Definition of Non-IFRS Measures subsection of our 2017 Annual Report)\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted for the current period.

We missed our performance targets in Construction Services due to continued UK waste-to-energy project impacts (more details below). Net income as a percentage of net revenue was impacted by normal seasonality effects, project performance issues in our Buildings business operating unit, waste-to-energy project impacts in Construction Services, and an unrealized fair value impact of a $2.7 million IFRS 9 accounting change (more details below). We believe we will achieve our annual targets by the end of the fiscal year. Stantec achieved organic gross revenue growth of 1.7% and organic net revenue growth of 2.6%. The Company achieved organic net revenue growth in both Consulting Services and Construction Services and in all geographies and business operating units except Buildings. Buildings was affected by continued weakness in UK and Middle East markets and by project execution issues, which we anticipate will improve during the year. Our Energy & Resources business operating unit experienced double-digit organic growth in Q1 18 compared to Q1 17, with strong revenue growth in all sectors. Construction Services experienced organic gross revenue retraction of 3.7% and organic net revenue growth in Q1 18 compared to Q1 17. During the quarter, we recorded a net $3 million impact related to UK waste-to-energy projects. Stantec continues to pursue claims against parties the Company believes are responsible for these added costs. Gross margin was down 1.7%—from 53.9% in Q1 17 to 52.2% in Q1 18. Gross margin for Consulting Services decreased in our Buildings business operating unit primarily because of project execution issues. Our Energy & Resources business operating unit also experienced a lower gross margin because of the mix of projects and competitive pressures. Also, gross margin in our US Water business was impacted by the divestiture of Innovyze, which operated at higher margins. Administrative and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 43.3% in Q1 17 to 41.3% in Q1 18, mainly due to improved utilization of employee resources, lower integration costs, management focus on cost reductions, and a decrease in occupancy costs from consolidating office spaces. EBITDA increased 0.7%—from $89.7 million in Q1 17 to $90.3 million in Q1 18. Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.6%—from $89.9 million in Q1 17 to $90.4 million in Q1 18. During the quarter, the Company adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), which impacts the way the Company recognizes and records revenues. The cumulative effect of adoption was recognized as a $23.9 million adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company also adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which changes the way Stantec classifies financial assets, accounts for debt modifications, records unrealized fair value gains and losses on equity securities, and calculates loss provisions through an expected credit loss model. The cumulative effect of adoption was recognized as a $0.1 million adjustment to opening retained earnings. Due to revised accounting policies under IFRS 9, Stantec had a $2.7 million fair value adjustment in Other Income in Q1 18 related to unrealized losses on equity investments held for self-insured liabilities. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 5%—from $0.40 in Q1 17 to $0.42 in Q1 18. During the quarter, Stantec exercised its option to use the Company’s Normal Course Issuer Bid to repurchase 279,686 common shares at an average price of $32.34 per share and an aggregate price of $8.9 million. Stantec’s backlog of secured work is strong at $5.0 billion—$3.8 billion in Consulting Services and $1.2 billion in Construction Services.\nSubsequent Events\nOn April 1, 2018, Stantec acquired Traffic Design Group Limited (TDG), an 80-person transportation firm with offices throughout New Zealand and an office in Sydney, Australia. Building on TDG’s 40-year history of supporting communities in New Zealand and Australia, Stantec is now one of the largest transportation practices in the region.\nOn April 26, 2018, Stantec announced that it has initiated a strategic review of MWH Constructors, Stantec Treatment, and Slayden (“Constructors”), acquired with MWH Global Inc. in May 2016. During the strategic review, Stantec will evaluate ways to optimize the value of Constructors to provide the best prospects for employees, clients, and shareholders. The strategic review will be further discussed during Stantec’s first quarter conference call this morning (see below for more information).\nAdditional Company Activity\nOn February 21, 2018, Stantec declared a dividend of $0.1375 per share that was paid on April 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 29, 2018. On May 9, 2018, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.1375 per share, payable on July 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of June 29, 2018.\nOn March 19, 2018, Stantec signed a letter of intent to acquire Norwest Corporation (Norwest), a 140-person energy and resources firm headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, with other offices in Vancouver, British Columbia; Denver and Trinidad, Colorado; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Charleston, West Virginia. When complete, this acquisition will strengthen Stantec’s presence in the recovering energy and resources sector in western Canada and the western United States. We anticipate this acquisition will close in Q2 18.\nOn April 26, 2018, Stantec signed a letter of intent to acquire Cegertec, a leading 250-person engineering and project management firm headquartered in Chicoutimi, Quebec, with offices in Quebec City, Montreal, and soon in Beauce’s St-Georges. This acquisition will significantly complement Stantec’s existing Quebec markets, services, and geographic presence, reinforcing our position as a leader in Quebec’s engineering industry.\nAs part of the Company’s commitment to doing business that meets the needs of the present while contributing to an environmentally, socially, and economically viable future, Stantec recently published its 2017 Sustainability Report. Prepared in accordance with the internationally recognized Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards framework, the report shares Stantec’s ongoing commitment to environmental, social, and economic sustainability and addresses the Company’s sustainability performance for fiscal year 2017.
