He said at least 30 soldiers and militiamen were killed.\nIn recent months the militants have stepped up hit-and-run attacks in an area whose terrain makes it difficult for the army to secure, relying on ambushes to replenish their weapons and equipment, activists say.\nThe British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict, said at least 26 people fighting on the Syrian government side were killed, including 17 non-Syrians, among them Iranians.\nPro-government social media sites gave lists of 16 officers and soldiers killed or injured and said it was verifying names of others who were killed.\nIslamic State, which was driven from most of the Euphrates River valley last year, now controls only two besieged desert areas in eastern Syria. The group also captured a third of neighbouring Iraq in 2014 but was largely defeated there last year.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; editing by John Stonestreet and David Stamp\n Advertise with Us ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:24:05.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
