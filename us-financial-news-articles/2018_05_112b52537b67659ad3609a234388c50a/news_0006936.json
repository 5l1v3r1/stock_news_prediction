KenGen, which is 70 percent owned by the government, has an installed capacity of 1,631 MW.\nDemand for electricity is growing at about 8 percent a year according to the government’s transmission and generation plan.\nEast Africa’s richest economy is ramping up electricity production and investing in its grid to keep up with the growing demand for power and to reduce frequent blackouts.\nIt relies heavily on renewables such as geothermal and hydropower.\nThe World Bank said in its statement that the project would help build on those gains and “ultimately ... lower the cost of electricity”.\nKenya’s energy minister ordered the sector regulator on Friday to review electricity tariffs after persistent complaints by consumers that electricity distributor Kenya Power was overcharging them.\nReporting by Omar Mohammed Editing by Maggie Fick and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:01:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
