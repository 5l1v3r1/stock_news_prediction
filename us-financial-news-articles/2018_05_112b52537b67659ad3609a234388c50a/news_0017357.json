The newly acquired leases are located within the proposed 3D seismic geophysical survey area, which is scheduled to commence in August and will include approximately 9,000 data points. To date the Company has conducted a paleontology survey and is nearing completion of the archeological survey.\nUnder terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”), MGX has the option to earn a Net Revenue Interest (“NRI”) on 9,158.4 gross/net acres within the Company’s area of mutual interest.

Seller delivered 83.0% NRI on 8,481.53 acres, and 82.5% on remaining 677.31 acres. On or before December 15, 2021, MGX will drill a well on the largest of the acquired leases to a TVD of 8,000' or to a depth sufficient to test the Cane Creek Shale (Cycle 21) of the Paradox Formation. MGX has the option to extend the drilling obligation for an additional three years in exchange for payment of an additional $100,000. MGX also has an option to acquire an additional lease covering 1,172.48 acres if and when that lease is issued by the BLM.\nThe Blueberry Unit (oil, gas and lithium) and Lisbon Valley Claims (lithium) now consists of approximately 115,000 acres of oil and gas leases and 118,000 acres of largely overlying and contiguous mineral claims. Brine content within the Lisbon Valley oilfield have been historically reported as high as 730 ppm lithium (Superior Oil 88-21P).\nThe Project is being simultaneously explored for oil, gas, lithium and other brine minerals to determine locations for deployment of the Company’s lithium and mineral extraction technology.\nBlueberry Unit\nMGX is currently earning a 75% working interest in the Project, with the remaining interest primarily controlled by the Paradox Partner. The Paradox Partner has been engaged by MGX as subcontracted operator of the Project. The Project is host to National Instrument (N.I) 51-101 estimated prospective resources (the “Estimate”) consisting of leasehold and royalty interests in San Juan County, Utah and Miguel County.
