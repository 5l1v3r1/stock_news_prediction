More info: https://t.co/lOYN4BofdK .\n— Hawaiian Airlines (@HawaiianAir) May 4, 2018\nKilauea is the most active volcano in Hawaii, erupting almost continuously since 1983, according to the U.S. Geological Service. Several hundred to a thousand people live in subdivisions some 25 miles from Kilauea and received mandatory evacuation alerts on Thursday.\nAs of late Thursday local time, the USGS said the lava eruption had stopped but there may be more “lava outbreaks.”\n“It is not possible at this time to say when and where new vents may occur,” the agency said.\nIn November of last year, Bali’s primary airport was closed for several days due to the eruption of Mount Agung . And the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland in 2010 famously caused days of air travel headaches.
