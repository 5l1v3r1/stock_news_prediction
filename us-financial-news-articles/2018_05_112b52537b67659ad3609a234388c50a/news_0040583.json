(“Kirkland Lake Gold” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:KL) (NYSE:KL) (ASX:KLA) is pleased to announce that it has received acceptance from the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) to renew its normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”). The NCIB allows Kirkland Lake Gold to purchase up to 16,456,561 common shares of the Company (the “Shares”), representing 10% of the current issued and outstanding Shares in the public float as of May 15, 2018. As at May 15, 2018, the Company had 211,199,478 Shares issued and outstanding.\nPurchases of the Common Shares pursuant to the NCIB may be made through the facilities of the TSX and/or alternative Canadian trading systems, commencing on May 22, 2018 and ending on May 21, 2019, or such earlier time as the NCIB is completed or terminated by the Company. Any purchases made pursuant to the NCIB will be made in accordance with the rules of the TSX and will be made at market price at the time of purchase.\n­­The average daily trading volume for the six months’ period ended April 30, 2018, less prior NCIB purchases made on the TSX, was 799,839.
