He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media.\nThe monthly average for January-May arrivals stands around 1.36 million tonnes.\nThe trader added that Asia could need around 1 million tonnes of open-specification naphtha in June, but most of the barrels coming in were heavier grades.\nTraders had expected high prices for crude oil, used as a feedstock for making naphtha, to curb appetite for naphtha, but demand has remained robust.\n“Still-strong economic growth means that petrochemical players have been able to pass higher feedstock costs for naphtha down the value chain, and this factor should continue to offset the effect of higher underlying crude prices overall,” said Michael Dei-Michei, head of research at consulting firm JBC Energy.\nCrude prices hit their highest levels since late 2014 this month as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been withholding supplies since 2017 to push up prices and as the United States has announced new sanctions against major crude exporter Iran.\nSLOW TOO Supplies from the Middle East have also been slow, the Thomson Reuters Oil Research team said a weekly report.\nMay shipments from the Middle East at up to 2.7 million tonnes were below the 2017 monthly average of 2.9 million tonnes, according to the report.\nThe effects of a tight market have sent spot premiums for Indian cargoes of naphtha to a three-year high at more than $29 a tonne over Middle East Quote: s on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.\nHowever, any weakness in gasoline markets could sap the recent bull-run in prices for naphtha, which can also be used as a blending component for the fuel.\n“Should seasonal gasoline strength into the summer fail to materialise, then that would be a good reason for more naphtha to price out of the gasoline pool, causing renewed weakness in cracks,” said Dei-Michei.\nSince the start of the year, Asian gasoline has largely been in a contango structure, where front-month prices are lower than those for later delivery, implying oversupply.\nReporting by Seng Li Peng Editing by Henning Gloystein and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:31:28.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
