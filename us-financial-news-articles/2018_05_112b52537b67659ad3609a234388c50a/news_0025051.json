HUD said its review will examine whether the Obama-era regulation is consistent with the Supreme Court ruling.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T22:03:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
