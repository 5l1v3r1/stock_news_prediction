He and Kaloyeros were also charged with rigging a bidding process for another Buffalo Billion contract in favor of Syracuse, New York-based developer COR Development Co.\nTwo former COR executives, Steven Aiello and Joseph Gerardi, were also charged with bribing Howe, and are also expected to be defendants in the upcoming trial.\nBoth were also defendants in a separate trial for allegedly bribing Joseph Percoco, a former top Cuomo aide, to win favorable treatment for COR.\nPercoco was found guilty on multiple corruption charges. Aiello was convicted of one count of conspiracy, while Gerardi was acquitted.\nJurors also deadlocked on charges against energy executive Peter Galbraith Kelly, but he pleaded guilty to fraud last week rather than face a second trial.\nHowe testified as a star witness for prosecutors in the earlier case, but was jailed after admitting under cross-examination that he had violated his cooperation agreement.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T01:25:30.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
