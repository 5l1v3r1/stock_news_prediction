Fowler followed by golfing a 2-2 fastball off the top of the right field wall and into the seats for his fifth homer and the Cardinals’ fifth walk-off win in 17 home games.\nThe Cardinals swept the three-game weekend series.\nMike Mayers (1-0) got the win despite allowing Javier Baez’s ninth homer in the top of the 14th that gave Chicago a brief 3-2 edge. However, Fowler’s dramatics extended St. Louis’ winning streak to five games and the Cubs’ losing streak to five games.\nIt was St. Louis’ first game since losing catcher Yadier Molina to the 10-day disabled list earlier Sunday. Molina underwent emergency surgery after being hit in the groin with a foul tip in the ninth inning on Saturday.\nThe game lasted 4:46 and was delayed twice in the first three innings by rain for a total of 59 minutes.\nChicago initiated the scoring in the top of the first inning. Anthony Rizzo lofted a sacrifice fly to deep center that scored Willson Contreras, who singled in his debut as a leadoff hitter and then reached third on an infield hit by Kyle Schwarber and a throwing error by third baseman Jedd Gyorko.\nAn inning later, Gyorko got the run back by lining his third homer of the year, a solo shot off an advertising panel just behind the left field wall.\nKris Bryant gave the Cubs a 2-1 edge in the fourth when he led off with a tape-measure homer to the third deck in left field, his fourth of the year.\nThat lead lasted until the sixth, when Kolten Wong walloped a two-out RBI triple to right that Jason Heyward appeared to lose in the lights. It made the Cardinals the last team in the majors to collect a triple this year.\nNeither starter was around for the decision. Chicago left-hander Jon Lester lasted 5 1/3 innings, yielding six hits and two runs while walking four and whiffing four. St. Louis right-hander Michael Wacha also pitched 5 1/3 innings, permitting six hits and two runs, one earned, with three walks and five strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:35:13.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
