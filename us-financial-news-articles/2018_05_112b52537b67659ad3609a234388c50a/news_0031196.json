Those receiving placebo reported 5.2 fewer attacks per week, it said.\nPatients who participated in the trial had a baseline average of 17.5 cluster headache attacks per week. Cluster headaches are recurring, intense headaches that can occur several times daily during a “cluster period.”\nGalcanezumab targets a protein associated with pain signaling called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Lilly’s drug is part of a new class of drugs targeting CGRP in order to treat migraines being developed by companies including Amgen Inc , Teva and Allergan.\nLilly has already reported positive migraine data for galcanezumab, and expects a decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the third quarter 2018.\nAmgen Inc’s Aimovig is likely to be the first drug in the class approved, with a decision expected by the FDA later this week.\nLilly said an estimated 85-90 percent of cluster headache cases are “episodic” with attacks occurring in periods that last from seven days to one year, with pain-free remission periods of one month or longer. The rest are classified as “chronic” with attacks occurring for more than a year without a remission period, or with remission lasting less than a month.
