Firms were nonetheless reluctant to change their structure because of the tax advantages of partnerships.\nKKR hopes the change will make the stock more attractive to mutual funds and other institutional investors, which mostly don’t invest in publicly traded partnerships. This lack of demand has depressed KKR’s stock price, said Scott Nuttall, KKR’s co-president and co-chief operating officer.\n“It became clear to us that we’ve been fishing in a small pond with a slow leak and wondering why we weren’t catching anything,” he said on a conference call Thursday to discuss the firm’s first-quarter financial results.\nThe corporate structure became more attractive late last year after Congress passed the new tax law, which lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Still, William Janetschek, KKR’s chief financial officer, said the conversion will eventually raise the firm’s effective tax rate to about 22% from roughly 7%.\nKKR, which said the change will be effective July 1, will become the second among its peers to move forward with a conversion. Ares Management LP became a corporation on March 1. Blackstone Group LP, Apollo Global Management LLC, Carlyle Group LP and other peers have expressed caution, citing the expected hit to their profits.\nThe driving rationale for a conversion is that making shares accessible to a broader group of investors, including potentially being included in indexes, will help lead to higher valuations. KKR’s peers have been weighing the change too, and are likely to watch KKR closely to see if a change in its stock price outweighs any hit to the bottom line.\n“We’re monitoring carefully all aspects of the issue. We’re not in a hurry,” said Blackstone Chief Financial Officer Michael Chae on a recent earnings call. “This is a race that does not necessarily go to the swift, and you have one shot at making a thoughtful decision.”\nShares of KKR climbed 4.1% to $22.39 in midday trading after it said its profit for the quarter ended March 31 fell to $170.1 million, or 32 cents a share, from $259.3 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier.\nKKR’s economic profit, a closely watched performance measure that reflects unrealized investment gains, fell to $364.7 million, or 42 cents a share, from $549.9 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Still, the result exceeded the 11-cent average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\nFirms have reported lower profits as a rise in market volatility has come along with slower growth in the value of their portfolio companies. KKR’s private-equity portfolio, which includes significant stakes in a number of publicly traded companies, climbed 0.4% in the quarter. That compares with 4% growth for rival Carlyle and 6.4% growth for Blackstone. The S&P 500 fell 1.2% over the period.\nKKR’s assets under management were $176.4 billion in the first quarter, up 28% over the previous year. The firm said its distributable earnings, the portion of profits that could be paid out to shareholders, fell to $303.5 million, or 37 cents a share, from $346.5 million, or 43 cents a share.\nKKR said that after the July 1 conversion, it will pay shareholders an annualized dividend of 50 cents per share. For the past several quarters, KKR had been paying dividends of 17 cents each quarter, or 68 cents a year. The corporate structure will mean shareholders won’t have to pay as much in taxes on their dividends, dulling the impact of the cut. The firm also said it would boost its stock-buyback authorization by $500 million.\nKKR said it would simplify its reporting to investors after the conversion to a traditional corporation by emphasizing the performance metrics it considers most relevant. KKR no longer plans to focus on economic net income, favoring metrics such as assets under management, management fees, book value and distributable earnings.\nRegarding Apollo Global, it reported a first-quarter loss on Thursday. On its conference call, co-founder Josh Harris said the firm is monitoring “the sustainability of any value creation since converting to…a [corporation] is essentially a one-time decision and permanent decision.”\n—Allison Prang contributed to this article.\nWrite to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com and Chris Cumming at chris.cumming@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T21:23:15.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
