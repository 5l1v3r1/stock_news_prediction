At the same time, the Company expanded both the activities of retail space for rent at the gas stations as well as the range of digital services. The expansion of our various services and the prime locations we operate across the country create strong value for our customers, which is reflected in our results.\n\"Conversely, the refining segment was adversely affected a number of factors. These include the market transition to backwardation which increased the cost of holding inventory of crude oil, the rise in world oil prices, and the weaker US dollar/shekel exchange rate compared with last year.\n\"Paz continues to enhance its assets and we invested NIS 125 million in the current quarter. This was mainly used for the purchase of property rights of gas stations, the construction of an off-gas recovery (OGR) facility for recovering and processing refinery gas, the expansion of the retail areas and the development of our digital platform.\"\nMain highlights for Paz Group by Segment:\nThe Retail and Wholesale Segment\nThe operating income for the Retail and Wholesale segment in Q1/2018 totaled NIS 99 million, an increase of 10% compared with Q1/2017.\nThe positive trend in the Retail and Wholesale Division continued, which was due to a 10% increase in the revenues of the Yellow chain to NIS 202 million, an increase in the income from property leases, and continued growth in the quantity of fuel sold at the stations. The Company continued to focus on increasing sales from the retail fueling stations while leveraging its competitive advantages. This is in terms of its national presence at various prime locations and its broad customer base, while expanding the range of products sold at the convenience stores and positioning the sites as collection and delivery points for online sales sites and distributors.\nThe Refining Segment\nThe refining segment completed Q1/2018 with an adjusted operating loss of NIS 1 million compared with an adjusted operating income of NIS 74 million in Q1/2017.\nThe results of the segment were adversely affected by the rise in barrel prices, which raised the cost of consumption and losses, the transition to backwardation market structure which increased the cost of holding the inventory, and the lower dollar/shekel exchange rate (as Paz's sales are in dollars while the production costs are in shekels). In addition, global refining margins declined this quarter, but the Ashdod Refinery maintained a relatively high premium compared to the benchmark refining margins. In Q1/2018 the Ural benchmark margin totaled $4.0/barrel, the KBC benchmark margin $3.5/barrel and the Paz Ashdod refinery margin totaled $7.0/barrel.\nThe refinery has maintained good operational continuity and is currently completing the construction of an OGR facility (gas separation facility), which is expected to be operational in July. The activity of this facility is expected to improve the refinery's profitability.\nThe Industries and Services Segment\nThe Industries and Services segment concluded Q1/2018 with operating income of NIS 66 million, a decrease of 13% compared to Q1/2017. The decrease is primarily due to the warm winter which led to a decrease in Pazgas's sales in the private sector.\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nThree months ended, March 31,\nYear ended, December 31,\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\nNIS Millions\n2018\n2017\n2017\nRevenues\n3,050\n2,859\n11,285\nCost of Sales\n2,627\n2,286\n9,480\nGross Profit\n423\n573\n1,805\nSelling and marketing expenses\n232\n229\n935\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n43\n44\n191\nOther income, net\n1\n-3\n13\nTotal operating expenses\n276\n270\n1,139\nOperating income\n147\n303\n666\nFinancial income\n19\n66\n201\nFinancial expenses\n66\n33\n135\nFinancial income (expenses), net\n-47\n33\n66\nIncome before income tax\n100\n336\n732\nIncome tax expenses\n23\n67\n157\nNet income for period\n77\n269\n575\nAttributable to:\nEquity holders of the Company\n76\n268\n572\nNon-controlling interests\n1\n1\n3\nNet income for the period\n77\n269\n575\nNet earnings per share attributable to equity holders of the Company:\nBasic net earnings per share (in NIS)\n7.50\n26.38\n56.35\nDiluted net earnings per share (in NIS)\n7.48\n26.33\n56.21\nThe information presented in this press release is presented solely for the convenience of the reader and does not constitute a basis for making any investment decisions or any recommendation or opinion nor is it a substitute for the exercise of judgment by an investor or a potential investor.
