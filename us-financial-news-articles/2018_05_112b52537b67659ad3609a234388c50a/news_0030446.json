Are they really going to push for this write-off from the ECB? That’s a big question mark,” Societe Generale FX strategist Alvin Tan said.\nThe euro fell sharply against the Swiss franc, which typically attracts capital in times of uncertainty. It dropped 0.6 percent to a five-week low of 1.1780 francs.\nSome analysts played down the importance of Italian politics for the euro on Wednesday.\nOnly five percent of Italian government bonds are held by non-EU residents, making the chances of a massive flight of capital unlikely, ADM Investor Services market strategist Marc Ostwald said.\nOstwald said he suspected Asian central bank interventions to support their currencies against the dollar would also mean reducing their euro foreign exchange reserves, in order to keep their portfolios balanced.\nThe euro had been a top performer in 2018, with traders predicting prolonged dollar weakness because of U.S. trade and budget deficits and euro zone economic strength.\nBets that the Federal Reserve will in fact be an outlier in tightening monetary policy among major central banks and signs the euro zone’s economy recovery has peaked has seen the euro slide from three-year highs of above $1.24 in April. The currency is now down 1.8 percent against the dollar in 2018.\nThe dollar index rose 0.4 percent to 93.625, its highest since Dec. 19.\nEMERGING LOSERS The dollar has gained since mid-April and clawed back most of its 2018 losses after the reassessment of the path of U.S. monetary policy.\nMoves by China and the United States to avoid a full-blown trade war have allowed investors to focus on the yield advantage the United States enjoys.\nThe U.S. currency got a boost on Tuesday when strong U.S. consumer spending numbers sent 10-year Treasury yields surging to a seven-year peak of 3.095 percent.\n“Today could see a repeat of yesterday. Momentum would certainly seem to back a further dollar advance with little to stop U.S. 10-year Treasury yields pushing to 3.20 percent,” ING FX strategist Viraj Patel said.\nThe yen budged only slightly after data showed Japan’s economy contracted for the first time in nine quarters during the first quarter of 2018.\nEmerging market currencies suffered more losses on Wednesday with the dollar’s rise, although the Turkish lira pulled back from record lows after the central bank said it would intervene to stop its slide.
