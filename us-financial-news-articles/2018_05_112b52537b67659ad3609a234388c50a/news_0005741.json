A political crisis that resulted in the resignation of former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski last month also dampened investment in one of Latin America’s most stable economies.\nThe new finance minister cut the government’s view of this year’s growth rate to 3.6 percent from 4 percent previously.\nBut Velarde said the central bank still expects a 4 percent economic expansion, up from 2.5 percent last year.\n“There’s no reason to be so pessimistic,” Velarde said in an interview, citing increases in sales taxes, imports, and consumption of electricity and cement.\n“We’re seeing very strong signs of recovery in consumption, even without the government doing anything,” Velarde said.\nVelarde said higher prices for the minerals that Peru exports were drawing fresh investment to the Andean country - the world’s No. 2 copper producer - while the bank’s “expansive” monetary stance has encouraged lending.\nBut the consumer price index likely fell “slightly” this month, Velarde said. The monthly decline does not, however, alter the bank’s forecast for annual inflation to pick up from the current 0.36 percent to end the year at 2 percent, he added.\n“We see it as a reversion of supply factors that should not influence monetary policy very much,” Velarde said. “We don’t see a problem of deflation.”\nThe annual inflation rate should rise to between 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent this month, he added.\nVelarde also shrugged off any concerns about recent volatility in the local foreign exchange market.\n“The sol is a currency with extremely solid fundamentals. Even when it moves up or down, it moves much less than in other countries.” (Reporting by Teresa Cespedes, writing by Mitra Taj, editing by G Crosse)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T01:35:39.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
