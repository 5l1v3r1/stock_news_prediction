And it can hurt you: People write back significantly more often when you get the tone of your email right.\nBoomerang data scientist Brendan Greenley looked at messages from mailing list archives of over 20 online communities from different industries, extracted the opening and closing lines of each email and correlated them to the response rate each email received.
