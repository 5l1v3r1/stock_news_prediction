Iran lied on the front end,” Sanders said at a regular White House briefing. “They were dishonest actors and so the deal that was made was made on things that were not accurate. Particularly the fact that Iran’s nuclear capability were far more advanced and further along than they indicated.” Reporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Leslie Adler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T21:47:48.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
