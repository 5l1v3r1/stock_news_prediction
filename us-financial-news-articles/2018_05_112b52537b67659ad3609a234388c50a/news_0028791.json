With several family members watching from the stands, Fowler recorded his first career hit with a single in the fourth.\nFowler’s first career hit occurred after Davis and Chapman homered in a span of seven pitches off Gray (2-3).\nMarcus Semien hit a bases-clearing double in the ninth off David Robertson and matched a career high with four RBIs.\nJed Lowrie had three hits, homered and added an RBI single for Oakland, which scored two runs or less in its previous five games, matching the longest such streak for the A’s in the last 39 years.\nMatt Joyce added insurance with a solo homer as the A’s beat the Yankees for the fifth straight time.\nGleyber Torres and Aaron Judge homered for the Yankees, who dropped consecutive games for the first time since April 8-10. New York also lost for the third time in its last 20 games.\nGray allowed five runs and a season-high nine hits in five innings. It was the most hits he allowed since joining the Yankees.\nKendall Graveman (1-5) returned from the minors and ended a personal five-game losing streak. He allowed four runs (one earned) and three hits in six innings.\nAfter Graveman was lifted, the seventh and eighth were a struggle before the A’s scored three times in the ninth.\nLou Trivino gave up a bases-loaded walk to Judge to make it a one-run game, but Yusmeiro Petit retired Didi Gregorius and Giancarlo Stanton with the bases loaded.\nPetit also recorded the first two outs of the eighth before Blake Treinen recorded the final four outs and notched his sixth save in eight opportunities.\nOakland struck quickly against its former teammate by taking a 3-0 lead in the second inning.\nDavis made it 1-0 when he hit a 3-1 fastball over the right-center field fence into the bleachers for his 10th homer of the season. Six pitches later, Chapman hit an 0-2 fastball to the loading dock beyond the left-center field fence.\nAfter Oakland took a 5-1 lead, Judge made it a one-run game by hitting his 10th homer, but Lowrie provided the eventual game-winning run by hitting his ninth homer with two outs in the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-12T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:29:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
