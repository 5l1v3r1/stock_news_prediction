Unicredit, UBI Banca , Banco BPM and Intesa Sanpaolo rose 2.2 to 2.8 percent.\nUtility Enel, which had also been hurt by investors pricing in some of the coalition’s policies on renewable energy, traded up 1.9 percent.\nBanks fuelled a 0.2 percent gain in Europe’s STOXX 600 , while Germany’s DAX rose 0.5 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 was closed for a holiday and with U.S. markets also closed, trading volumes were thinner.\nSpain’s IBEX also rose 0.7 percent as the rally spread to other southern European markets. Spanish stocks had fallen sharply on Friday on concerns Prime Minister Rajoy would face a no confidence vote.\nFinancials and utilities led the recovery in Spain too, with Santander, BBVA and Caixabank top gainers along with Iberdrola and Gas Natural.\nDanish biotech firm Genmab fell 24 percent after it ended combination trials of its multiple myeloma drug Darzalex with Tecentriq, citing “no observed benefit” and an increase in deaths after the combination treatment.
