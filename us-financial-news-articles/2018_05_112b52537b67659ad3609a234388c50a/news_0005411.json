For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, income from operations increased 0.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the reported GAAP net loss attributable to NHC was $2,791,000. The net loss was primarily due to the new accounting standard of recording the quarterly market value change of our marketable equity securities through the income statement and also the estimated legal settlement within our Caris hospice partnership. Excluding the $15.5 million unrealized losses in our marketable equity securities portfolio, along with Caris’ legal settlement and other non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $16,093,000 (1). For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the reported GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.18 and the adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.06 (1).\n(1) See the tables below that provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items.\nAbout NHC\nNHC affiliates operate for themselves and third parties 76 skilled nursing facilities with 9,623 beds.
