Reflecting the company’s new accounting method, ASC 606, total sales volumes came in at 370 MBoe/d.\nNet income attributable to Noble soared to $554 million, or $1.14 per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $36 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier, helped by a gain of about $795 million from asset sales.\nExcluding items, it earned 35 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 25 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The earnings beat was driven by a 30 percent jump in U.S. onshore shale production and higher crude oil prices.\nHouston-based Noble’s total revenue rose 24 percent to $1.29 billion.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude CLc1 futures averaged at $62.89 per barrel in the quarter, up 21.5 percent from a year earlier.\nShale producers, which have benefited from a surge in production over the past few years, are facing increasing calls from investors to use a windfall of cash to boost dividends and share buybacks.\nLast week, Noble announced a 10 percent rise in its quarterly dividend rate.\nReporting by Taenaz Shakir in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T14:16:28.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
