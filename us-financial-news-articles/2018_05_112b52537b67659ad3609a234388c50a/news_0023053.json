Carrefour Brasil did not provide details about expansion plans for the service.\nThe drive-through option is already available in various countries where parent company Carrefour SA operates. However, the expansion of the service into Brazil underscores how the group is betting on digitalization and trying to take advantage of Brazil’s rapidly growing e-commerce market.\nIn October, Carrefour Brasil launched a so-called “dark store” in Sao Paulo, which delivers groceries to customers’ doors, a novelty in Latin America. In November, the group launched a more traditional click-and-collect service.\nCarrefour Brasil’s archrival, GPA, has also emphasized digitalization efforts in recent months. In April, the company, controlled by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA , brought on a tech-savvy new chief executive from electronics and appliance subsidiary Via Varejo SA.
