(NASDAQ:FRPH)\nFirst Quarter Consolidated Results of Operations\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $1,560,000 or $.15 per share versus $1,443,000 or $.14 per share in the same period last year. Total revenues were $12,622,000, up 35.4%, versus the same period last year, primarily because of the addition of rental revenues from Dock 79. Our net income was adversely impacted by $747,000 in expenses related to the pending sale of our industrial warehouse portfolio.\nFirst Quarter Segment Operating Results\nAsset Management Segment:\nTotal revenues in this segment were $8,128,000, up $843,000 or 11.6%, over the same period last year. Net Operating Income (NOI) in this segment for the first quarter increased slightly to $5,857,000, compared to $5,689,000 in the same period last year. We ended the first quarter with total occupied square feet of 3,721,213 versus 3,525,234 at the end of the same period last year, an increase of 5.6% or 195,979 square feet. Our overall occupancy rate was 93.4%.\nThis past quarter we entered into contract to sell 41 industrial warehouses and two adjacent lots to an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners for a total purchase price of $358.9 million. Pending shareholder approval at our annual meeting on May 14, we expect to close on this transaction the following week. These properties comprise substantially all the assets of our Asset Management Segment. We are currently exploring options to reinvest a significant portion of the proceeds into opportunities more in line with our other business segments where recently we have enjoyed better returns.\nMining Royalty Lands Segment:\nTotal revenues in this segment were $1,772,000 versus $1,762,000 in the same period last year. Total operating profit in this segment was $1,541,000, a decrease of $18,000 versus $1,559,000 in the same period last year.\nLand Development and Construction Segment:\nThe Land Development and Construction segment is responsible for (i) seeking out and identifying opportunistic purchases of income producing warehouse/office buildings, and (ii) developing our non-income producing properties into income production.\nWith respect to ongoing projects:\nWe are fully engaged in the formal process of seeking PUD entitlements for our 118 acre tract in Hampstead, Maryland. Last year we began construction on a 96,047 square foot building at Patriot Business Center that we expect to finish in the second quarter of 2018. This building is included in the sale to Blackstone. We began construction in the third quarter of last year on our joint venture with St. John Properties and expect to complete construction of the first phase of this project in the third quarter of 2018. This first phase will comprise four buildings totaling 100,000 square feet of office and retail space. Our Essexshire residential project totaling 129 single family building lots is moving towards entitlement. We are in the process of designing and permitting a 95,000 square foot spec building at Hollander Business Park. We expect to begin construction during the second quarter of 2018.\nRiverFront on the Anacostia Segment:\nAt the end of the first quarter, Dock 79 was 90.8% leased and 91.8% occupied. As the first “generation” of leases expire, the renewal rate of 61.9% during the first quarter is in line with expectations while the average rent increase of 2.8% is better than expected.\nSummary and Outlook\nThis past quarter was one of our most important ever for obvious reasons. Our portfolio of industrial real estate took decades to put together. Most of the assets came from land we purchased, developed, and managed in-house. The amount of sweat equity our Baltimore office put into those assets would have given even the most unsentimental seller a moment’s hesitation. However, because of the reduction in corporate income tax rates in this low cap rate environment, the opportunity to sell was simply too good to pass up.\nThough monumental, the sale of such a substantial portion of this company will not leave us wanting for things to do. We still have vacant lots at Hollander and Lakeside that we intend to develop, and the remaining phases of RiverFront on the Anacostia will require our attention for the next decade at least. Our aggregates royalties and the second life of those quarries will be generating returns for this company and occupying the time of its management for longer than many of us will be around.\nIn the short term, though, we will be hard at work on Phase II of RiverFront on the Anacostia and our other ongoing projects; but most importantly, we will be determining the highest and best use for the proceeds of the sale.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to the end of last quarter, in April, construction began on Phase II of our RiverFront on the Anacostia project, which we expect to deliver in the first or second quarter of 2020.\nConference Call\nThe Company will also host a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. (EDT).
