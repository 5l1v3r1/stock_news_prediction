Even if the resolution passes, though, it has an uphill battle ahead of it.\nAll 49 Senate Democrats appear set to vote for the resolution, as does Republican Susan Collins of Maine. Should it pass the Senate, the resolution would move to the House, where it’s likely to encounter tougher opposition. And even if it manages to get through that branch of Congress, it would require the signature of Donald Trump, who has previously shown an inclination to toss the rules out.\nBarring Congressional changes, net neutrality is set to expire on June 10 , according to a recently issued notice by the FCC.\nThe repeal of net neutrality was supported by telecom providers such as Comcast and Verizon , but opposed by large tech companies, including Google and Facebook . (Several major websites, including Reddit and Pornhub , have protested the action as well.) The decision, made late last year prompted several lawsuits.\nAt the same time, several states, including Washington , Oregon , and California , are proposing—and passing—net neutrality laws of their own, setting them up for a showdown with the FCC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T17:41:25.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
