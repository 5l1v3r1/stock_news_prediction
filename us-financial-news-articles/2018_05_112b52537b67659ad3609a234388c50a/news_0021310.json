They cited competition from other banks and nonbank lenders as reason for the loosening.\nThe Fed raised interest rates three times in 2017 and did so again in March. The benchmark lending rate is currently in a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent.\nIt is widely expected to raise borrowing costs again when policymakers next meet on June 12-13 and has forecast two rate rises this year amid a strong economy.\nThe unemployment rate fell to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent, the Labor Department reported on Friday.\nBanks also reported modestly tightening loan standards for auto and credit card loans, according to the survey. Both categories also saw weaker demand from consumers.\nThe Fed surveyed loan officers at 72 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.\nReporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:45:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
