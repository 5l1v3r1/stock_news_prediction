The inspections were completed last year.\nIn a statement published by the MEE, Shandong on China’s eastern coast vowed to “unswervingly” implement government policies by tackling polluters and restructuring its heavy industrial economy.\nThe region pledged to resolve all major environmental problems by 2020, according to the statement, cutting concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 by half to 49 microgrammes per cubic metre over the period.\nIn its commitments, Xinjiang, a major oil and gas producing province, promised to set winter production caps on industries like thermal power production, steel, coal and chemicals in a bid to cut 2017 levels of PM2.5 by a quarter by 2020.\nThe manufacturing hub of Zhejiang, near Shanghai, promised to would cut PM2.5 to the Chinese national standard of 35 microgrammes, and make 91 percent of polluted arable land fit for human use by 2020.\nMeanwhile the major hydropower region of Sichuan pledged to improve regulation and shut down plants that encroach on protected land.\nBy the end of March, more than 2,000 government and state enterprise officials in 15 regions had been held to account as a result of the inspections, according to Reuters calculations based on MEE data. Most received an official reprimand and 22 face criminal charges.\nState-owned China Minmetals Group was also accused by inspectors of being a “big corporate bully” after it was found to have failed to rectify pollution problems.\nChina’s President Xi Jinping vowed this month to use the full might of the Communist Party to redress the damage done to the country’s skies, soil and water since its economy was first opened up in 1978.\nMeanwhile the central government is planning to launch a second round of regional environmental inspections early next year, the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily reported last week.\n“It shows how resolute the Centre is on this issue and how it is determined to keep up the pressure on the provinces,” said Peter Corne, managing partner at the legal firm Dorsey & Whitney in Shanghai, who follows China’s environmental policies.\n“They have nowhere to hide,” he added.
