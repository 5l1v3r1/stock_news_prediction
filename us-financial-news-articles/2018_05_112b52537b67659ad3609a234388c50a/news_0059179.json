Following the dose escalation phase, the Company intends to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SRF231 in a targeted set of solid and hematologic malignancies. Initial clinical results from this trial are expected in the first half of 2019. Surface holds worldwide rights to SRF231. SRF373, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting CD73: An IND for SRF373 was sponsored and filed by Surface’s collaborator, Novartis, in February 2018.
