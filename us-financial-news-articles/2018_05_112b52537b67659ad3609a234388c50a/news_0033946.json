There is no doubt that Russia undertook an unprecedented effort to interfere with our 2016 elections.\"\nThe Senate committee's takeaways on this facet of its Russia inquiry stand in contrast to the House Intelligence Committee, which had taken exception to the intelligence community's judgment that Putin favored Trump in a summary released prior to its final report.\nTrump had celebrated the House committee majority's final assessment, announcing in an all-caps tweet that the probe had found \"NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION\" between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump tweet\nDemocrats on the House committee, led by ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., denounced the majority's decision to end the probe and vowed to continue to investigate.\nThe Senate committee's closed-door hearing Wednesday included the testimony of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former NSA Director Mike Rogers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:50:06.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
