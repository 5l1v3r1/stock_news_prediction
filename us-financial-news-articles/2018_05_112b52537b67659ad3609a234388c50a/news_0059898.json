Mike Fries, President and Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Global, delivers his keynote speech at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 28, 2017. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\nThe merger was first approved in 2014 but then annulled by the General Court of the European Union, leading to a reassessment of the deal.\nThe Commission, which acts as the competition watchdog in the European Union, said Liberty Global had offered to scrap clauses that restrict broadcasters’ ability to offer their channels and content over the internet, maintain access to its network and not repurchase pay TV operator Film1.\n“The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns,” the Commission said.\nThe Court case was triggered by a complaint by Dutch telecoms group KPN ( KPN.AS ) about the combined market power of Liberty Global’s Dutch unit UPC and Ziggo.
