Adjusted earnings 1 per share increased 7 percent to $1.12, compared with pro forma adjusted earnings per share in the year-ago period of $1.05. Adjusted earnings per share excludes significant items in the quarter totaling net charges of $0.54 per share, as well as an $0.11 per share charge for DuPont amortization of intangible assets. Net sales increased 5 percent to $21.5 billion, with growth in most operating segments and geographic regions, from pro forma net sales of $20.5 billion in the year-ago period. The Materials Science division increased sales 17 percent, with double-digit gains in all segments and gains in all regions. The Specialty Products division increased sales 11 percent, with gains in most segments and all regions. These increases more than offset a decline in Agriculture sales of 25 percent driven by weather-related delays to planting seasons in the Northern Hemisphere and Brazil. Net sales included a 4 percent benefit from currency, primarily from the Euro. Volume declined 2 percent on a pro forma basis from the year-ago period, due to a weather-related shift in Agriculture. The Materials Science division increased volume 8 percent, with gains in most segments and all regions. The Specialty Products division increased volume 3 percent, with gains in all segments and most regions. Local price rose 3 percent on a pro forma basis, led by increases in all regions and most operating segments. Local price increased in each division, led by a 5 percent increase in the Materials Science division. Operating EBITDA 1 increased 6 percent on a pro forma basis from the year-ago period to $4.9 billion. The Materials Science division achieved 23 percent operating EBITDA growth, with double-digit gains in all segments. The Specialty Products division delivered 25 percent operating EBITDA growth, with double-digit gains in most segments. Earnings drivers included local price and volume gains in Materials Science and Specialty Products, cost synergies, a benefit from currency, lower pension/OPEB costs 2 and higher equity earnings. These gains more than offset a decline in Agriculture due to a weather-related shift impacting seed and crop protection deliveries, higher feedstock costs in the other two divisions and planned maintenance and weather-related outages in Materials Science. The Company achieved cost synergy savings of more than $300 million in the first quarter, ahead of its run-rate plan and now on pace to deliver a 75 percent run-rate against its $3.3 billion cost synergy commitment by the end of the third quarter of 2018. DowDuPont returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends ($0.9 billion) and share repurchases ($1 billion).\nCEO Quote:\n“We delivered solid first-quarter sales and operating earnings gains, while our teams advanced the intended business separations,” said Ed Breen, chief executive officer of DowDuPont. “The Materials Science and Specialty Products divisions delivered better-than-expected top- and bottom-line growth with higher prices and volume gains, including value adding product innovations. Their growth more than offset weather-related delays that are expected to shift a substantial portion of our Agriculture earnings to the second quarter. All three divisions hit their cost synergy targets, producing savings of over $300 million as we build momentum on our $3.3 billion in cost synergies and put more focus on the $1 billion in growth synergies. And we continue to expect Materials Science to spin by the end of the first quarter of 2019, with Agriculture and Specialty Products separating by June 1, 2019. These will be three world-class companies equipped to further their leadership positions in attractive growth markets.”\nFirst Quarter Division Highlights\nMaterials Science\nFirst quarter net sales increased 17 percent to $12.0 billion versus pro forma net sales in the year-ago period, with double-digit gains in all segments and gains in all regions. Volume grew 8 percent, local price rose 5 percent and currency improved 4 percent. First quarter Operating EBITDA grew 23 percent to $2.6 billion versus pro forma operating EBITDA in the same quarter last year, with double-digit gains in all segments. Equity earnings improved $53 million, driven by improvements from Sadara and the Kuwait joint ventures, which more than offset a reduction at the Thai joint ventures and the HSC Group.\nPerformance Materials & Coatings\nPerformance Materials & Coatings reported net sales of $2.3 billion, up 12 percent versus pro forma net sales of $2.1 billion in the year-ago period. Sales rose in all regions, with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Local price increased 9 percent, with gains in all regions and in both businesses. Volume declined 1 percent versus the year-ago period and currency benefited sales by 4 percent.\nConsumer Solutions delivered double-digit sales growth, driven by double-digit local price gains in most regions; disciplined price/volume management in upstream silicone intermediate products; traction on growth synergies; and robust demand in personal and home care end-markets. Coatings & Performance Monomers achieved high single-digit sales growth, driven by local price increases in all regions in response to higher raw material costs, which more than offset a volume decline due to supply constraints and proactive measures to shed low margin business.\nOperating EBITDA increased to $628 million, up 31 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $481 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to increased pricing, improved product mix and cost and growth synergies.\nEquity earnings for the segment totaled $41 million, compared with pro forma equity earnings of $91 million in the year-ago period. The decline was driven by lower earnings at the HSC Group due to settlements of long-term polysilicon sales agreements that benefited the same quarter last year.\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure reported net sales of $3.7 billion, up 30 percent versus pro forma net sales of $2.8 billion in the year-ago period. Double-digit sales gains were reported in all regions. Volume grew 14 percent and local price rose 11 percent. Currency benefited sales by 5 percent.\nPolyurethanes & CAV delivered robust sales growth on double-digit gains in all regions, driven by local price gains in all regions and volume gains in most regions. Volume growth was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and EMEA, enabled by the contributions from new capacity at the Sadara joint venture. Volume in North America was impacted by weather-related unplanned outages. The business achieved price increases and innovation-led customer wins in downstream, higher-margin systems applications. Merchant sales of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and caustic soda also expanded as a result of ongoing tightness in industry supply/demand fundamentals. Industrial Solutions reported a double-digit sales increase on local price gains and volume growth in all regions, driven by new production from the Sadara joint venture. The business reported increased demand for products used in electronic processing and crop protection applications. The business’s volume was also impacted by weather-related unplanned events. Construction Chemicals delivered high single-digit sales growth, led by demand for acrylic-based products in North America, local price increases and a tailwind from currency, which were partly offset by a decline in methyl cellulosics volume in EMEA due to capacity constraints.\nOperating EBITDA in the first quarter was $654 million, up 28 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $512 million in the year-ago period. Pricing momentum, cost synergies and demand growth, coupled with improved equity earnings, more than offset the impact of weather-related outages along the U.S. Gulf Coast, higher raw material costs and increased maintenance and turnaround activity.\nEquity earnings for the segment totaled $149 million, compared with pro forma equity earnings of $73 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year growth was driven by a reduction in equity losses from the Sadara joint venture, resulting from the operation of new facilities, and higher monoethylene glycol (MEG) pricing that benefited the EQUATE joint venture.\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics\nThe Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment reported net sales of $6.0 billion, up 12 percent from pro forma net sales of $5.4 billion in the year-ago period. The sales gain was driven by volume growth of 8 percent and a currency benefit of 4 percent, primarily in Europe. Local price increases in ethylene derivatives were offset by declines in hydrocarbons prices.\nThe Packaging and Specialty Plastics business grew volume in all regions on broad-based demand strength, supported by new capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast and increased Sadara production. Local price was up as increases in ethylene derivatives in the Americas more than offset moderate declines in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Notable highlights included double-digit sales gains in all regions, with robust demand growth in food and specialty packaging and industrial and consumer packaging end-markets in Asia Pacific and EMEA, as well as in rigid packaging applications in all regions. The business also delivered strong demand growth in elastomers applications, with double-digit volume gains in Asia Pacific and in hot melt adhesives in EMEA.\nOperating EBITDA for the segment totaled $1.3 billion, up 17 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $1.1 billion in the year-ago period. Polyethylene price increases; volume gains, including the benefit of increased supply from growth projects; lower commissioning and startup costs; higher equity earnings; and cost synergies more than offset increased feedstock costs.\nEquity earnings for the segment were $59 million, up from pro forma equity earnings of $32 million in the year-ago period. Equity earnings in the quarter benefited from a reduction in equity losses from the Sadara joint venture, as well as improved earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures on volume and price gains. These gains more than offset reduced earnings at the Thai joint ventures, where rising feedstock costs compressed margins.\nSpecialty Products\nFirst quarter net sales increased 11 percent to $5.6 billion versus pro forma net sales in the year-ago period, with gains in all regions and in most segments. Volume grew 3 percent, local price rose 2 percent, currency improved 4 percent and portfolio benefited sales by 2 percent. First quarter Operating EBITDA grew 25 percent to $1.6 billion versus pro forma operating EBITDA in the same quarter last year, with gains in all segments.\nElectronics & Imaging\nElectronics & Imaging delivered net sales of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 1 percent versus pro forma net sales in the year-ago period. Net sales declined as volume growth of 1 percent, local price gains of 1 percent and a 2 percent benefit from currency were more than offset by a 5 percent negative impact from portfolio-related actions (sales of the Display Films and Authentication businesses).\nVolume growth in the segment was driven by double-digit gains in semiconductor and interconnect solutions, primarily in Asia Pacific. Increased semiconductor content in end-use applications drove strong demand in both memory and logic market segments. Continued demand for mobile phones and other consumer electronics, as well as industrial applications, drove volume gains in interconnect solutions. Partially offsetting this growth was a decrease in photovoltaic and advanced materials due to declines in trichlorosilane (TCS) as a result of supply constraints and decreases in Tedlar ® film and Solamet ® paste as module production in China slowed in the quarter. Local price gains were driven by higher metals pricing.\nOperating EBITDA for the segment was $357 million, up 9 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $327 million in the year-ago period. Lower pension/OPEB costs, cost synergies, volume growth and a benefit from currency more than offset a negative impact from portfolio and higher unit costs.\nNutrition & Biosciences\nNutrition & Biosciences reported net sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of 21 percent from pro forma net sales of $1.4 billion in the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to a 12 percent net benefit from portfolio, a 4 percent benefit from volume and a 4 percent benefit from currency. Local price increased 1 percent versus the year-ago period. The net positive impact from portfolio-related actions was due to the acquisition of FMC’s Health & Nutrition business.\nVolume growth in the segment was led by Nutrition & Health with double-digit gains in probiotics and pharmaceuticals, coupled with increases in systems and texturants in Asia Pacific. Growth in probiotics was driven by increased demand in Asia Pacific and North America. Pharmaceuticals growth was led by increased demand for excipient applications in Asia Pacific and North America. Industrial Biosciences volumes grew on a double-digit improvement in CleanTech led by alkylation offerings in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Demand for microbial control solutions in energy markets and for bioactives in home and personal care applications also contributed to volume growth.\nOperating EBITDA for the segment was $418 million, up 32 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $317 million in the year-ago period driven by a portfolio benefit, volume growth, cost synergies and lower pension/OPEB costs, partially offset by higher costs due to growth investments.\nTransportation & Advanced Polymers\nTransportation & Advanced Polymers reported net sales of $1.4 billion, up from pro forma net sales of $1.3 billion in the year-ago period. Net sales growth of 14 percent reflected currency benefits of 6 percent, local price benefits of 5 percent and volume gains of 3 percent. The growth, which came from all regions, was led by strong demand from the transportation and electronics markets. Price increases, mainly in nylon enterprise and polyesters, driven by Zytel®, reflected tight polymer supply and higher feedstock costs.\nVolume gains were led by Kalrez® and Vespel® high-performance solutions as demand from the electronics and aerospace markets remained strong. Delrin® and Hytrel® contributed to sales growth in performance resins. Broad-based volume growth was led by Asia Pacific and North America.\nOperating EBITDA for the segment totaled $437 million, an increase of 36 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $321 million in the year-ago period. Lower pension/OPEB costs, favorable currency, sales gains and cost synergies contributed to the improvement, partly offset by higher raw material costs.\nSafety & Construction\nSafety and Construction delivered net sales of $1.3 billion, compared with pro forma net sales of $1.2 billion for the year-ago period. Net sales growth of 7 percent was driven by a currency benefit of 4 percent and volume gains of 3 percent. Local price was even with last year’s quarter.\nVolume gains in Tyvek® reflected strength in industrial personal protection, graphics and medical packaging. Within aramids, Nomex® volume gains were led by composites and energy solutions, while Kevlar® high-strength materials volume also rose amid strength in industrial personal protection and life protection. In the construction market, Corian® Design also rose, due to volume and favorable mix, while building solutions declined. Volume growth in water solutions came from reverse osmosis and ultra-filtration. Volumes were up across most regions, with the strongest growth in Asia Pacific. Forecast estimates remain strong from the construction market, although inclement weather adversely impacted sales of building products in the United States and Japan in the quarter.\nOperating EBITDA for the segment totaled $354 million, an increase of 21 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $292 million in the year-ago period. Lower pension/OPEB costs, cost synergies, reliability improvements and favorable currency more than offset higher costs.\nAgriculture\nFirst quarter net sales decreased 25 percent to $3.8 billion versus pro forma net sales in the year-ago period, driven by weather-related delays in the Northern Hemisphere and Brazil seasons. Volume decreased 28 percent, local price rose 1 percent and currency improved 2 percent. First quarter Operating EBITDA declined 39 percent to $891 million versus pro forma operating EBITDA in the same quarter last year.\nVolume declines were driven by weather-related delays to the start of planting seasons in the Northern Hemisphere and Brazil, lower expected planted area in both North America and Brazil, and lower sales in the Brazil safrinha season due to a shift to lower-technology corn driven by the delayed summer season harvest. Agriculture sales declines were partially offset by improvements in sunflower seeds sales in EMEA and growth in global insecticide sales.\nPrice increases were driven by continuing efforts to capture value in established brands across the crop protection portfolio globally.\nOperating EBITDA of $891 million declined 39 percent from $1.5 billion in the prior year. Weather-related selling shifts, lower expected planted area and an unfavorable mix driven by the shortened safrinha season were partially offset by cost synergies, favorable currency, higher selling price in crop protection and lower pension/OPEB costs.\nOutlook\n“The global economy continues to show solid momentum and broad-based growth, driven by consumer-led demand in both developed and developing economies,” said Howard Ungerleider, chief financial officer of DowDuPont. “There are discrete headwinds, including continued volatility in our input costs and weather-related softness in agriculture. However, leading indicators from manufacturing output, to improving energy markets, to employment and consumer spending remain largely positive, reflecting increased economic activity.”\n“Our portfolio benefits from these macro trends, and we see our innovations and growth investments driving above-market growth. We see this strength continuing into the second quarter. We expect second quarter net sales to be up more than 10 percent and operating EBITDA up more than 20 percent year-over-year.”\n“Looking ahead, the DowDuPont team remains focused on our priorities: delivering our operating and financial plan, including executing on our growth projects and innovation launches; achieving our synergy targets; and standing and spinning the intended companies on our stated timeline.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a live webcast of its first quarter earnings conference call with investors to discuss its results, business outlook and other matters today at 8:00 a.m. ET. The slide presentation that accompanies the conference call will be posted on the DowDuPont Investor Relations events and presentations page .

For 2017, activity prior to August 31, 2017 (the “Merger Date”) was prepared on a pro forma basis and activity after the Merger Date was prepared on a combined U.S. GAAP basis. The unaudited pro forma information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Pro forma adjustments have been made for (1) the preliminary purchase accounting impact, (2) accounting policy alignment, (3) eliminate the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Merger Agreement (e.g., one-time transaction costs), (4) eliminate the impact of transactions between Dow and DuPont, and (5) eliminate the effect of consummated or probable and identifiable divestitures agreed to with certain regulatory agencies as a condition of approval for the Merger. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., inventory step-up costs) are excluded. The unaudited pro forma information does not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs following the Merger that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of DowDuPont. The unaudited pro forma financial information provides shareholders with summary financial information and historical data that is on a basis consistent with how DowDuPont reports current financial information.\nDiscussion of revenue, operating EBITDA and price/volume metrics on a divisional basis for Agriculture is based on the results of the Agriculture segment; for Materials Science is based on the combined results of the Performance Materials & Coatings, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, and Packaging & Specialty Plastics segments; and for Specialty Products is based on the combined results of the Electronics & Imaging, Nutrition & Biosciences, Transportation & Advanced Polymers, and Safety & Construction segments.

Furthermore, the divisional discussions should not be construed as representative of future results of operations or financial condition for each of Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products on a standalone basis in connection with the Intended Business Separations.\nMerger of Equals\nEffective August 31, 2017, pursuant to the merger of equals transaction contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017 (the \"Merger Agreement\"), The Dow Chemical Company (\"Dow\") and E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (\"DuPont\") each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont Inc. (\"DowDuPont\" or the \"Company\") and, as a result, Dow and DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont Inc. (the \"Merger\"). Dow was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger and, as a result, the historical financial statements of Dow, prepared under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), for the periods prior to the Merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of DowDuPont.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nIn order to provide the most meaningful comparison of results of operations and results by segment, supplemental unaudited pro forma financial information has been included in the following financial schedules. The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of both Dow and DuPont and has been prepared to illustrate the effects of the Merger, assuming the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, pro forma adjustments have been made for (1) the preliminary purchase accounting impact, (2) accounting policy alignment, (3) the elimination of the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Merger Agreement (e.g., one-time transaction costs), (4) the elimination of the impact of transactions between Dow and DuPont, and (5) the elimination of the effect of consummated divestitures agreed to with certain regulatory agencies as a condition of approval for the Merger. The unaudited pro forma financial information was based on and should be read in conjunction with the separate historical financial statements and accompanying notes contained in each of the Dow and DuPont Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The pro forma financial information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, are presented on a U.S. GAAP basis.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what DowDuPont's results of operations actually would have been had the Merger been completed as of January 1, 2016, nor is it indicative of the future operating results of DowDuPont. The unaudited pro forma information does not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs following the Merger that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of DowDuPont. For further information on the unaudited pro forma financial information, please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 26, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release includes information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include the Company's pro forma consolidated results and pro forma earnings per share on an adjusted basis. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company's segments, including allocating resources. DowDuPont's management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the Company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the Company and a more useful comparison of year-over-year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the Company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Non-GAAP measures included in this release are defined below. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in the Selected Financial Information and Non-GAAP Measures starting on page 15. DowDuPont does not provide forward-looking U.S. GAAP financial measures or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual gains and losses, foreign currency exchange gains or losses, potential future asset impairments and purchase accounting fair value adjustments, as well as discrete taxable events, without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP results for the guidance period.\nAdjusted earnings per share is defined as \"Earnings per common share from continuing operations - diluted\" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items and the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with DuPont's intangible assets. Pro forma adjusted earnings per share is defined as \"Pro Forma earnings per common share from continuing operations - diluted\" excluding the after-tax impact of pro forma significant items and the after-tax impact of pro forma amortization expense associated with DuPont's intangible assets. Although amortization of DuPont's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation.
