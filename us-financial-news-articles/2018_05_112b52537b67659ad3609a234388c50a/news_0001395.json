Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a rare, aggressive type of thyroid cancer. The National Institutes of Health estimates there will be 53,990 new cases of thyroid cancer and an estimated 2,060 deaths from the disease in the United States in 2018. Anaplastic thyroid cancer accounts for about 1 to 2 percent of all thyroid cancers.\nBoth Tafinlar and Mekinist are also approved for use, alone or in combination, to treat BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. Additionally, Tafinlar and Mekinist are approved for use, in combination, to treat BRAF V600E mutation-positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\nThe efficacy of Tafinlar and Mekinist in treating ATC was shown in an open-label clinical trial of patients with rare cancers with the BRAF V600E mutation. Data from trials in BRAF V600E mutation-positive, metastatic melanoma or lung cancer and results in other BRAF V600E mutation-positive rare cancers provided confidence in the results seen in patients with ATC. The trial measured the percent of patients with a complete or partial reduction in tumor size (overall response rate). Of 23 evaluable patients, 57 percent experienced a partial response and 4 percent experienced a complete response; in nine (64 percent) of the 14 patients with responses, there were no significant tumor growths for six months or longer.\nThe side effects of Tafinlar and Mekinist in patients with ATC are consistent with those seen in other cancers when the two drugs are used together. Common side effects include fever (pyrexia), rash, chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), cough, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia (muscle pain), dry skin, decreased appetite, edema, hemorrhage, high blood pressure (hypertension) and difficulty breathing (dyspnea).\nSevere side effects of Tafinlar include the development of new cancers, growth of tumors in patients with BRAF wild-type tumors, serious bleeding problems, heart problems, severe eye problems, fever that may be severe, serious skin reactions, high blood sugar or worsening diabetes, and serious anemia.\nSevere side effects of Mekinist include the development of new cancers; serious bleeding problems; inflammation of intestines and perforation of the intestines; blood clots in the arms, legs or lungs; heart problems; severe eye problems; lung or breathing problems; fever that may be severe; serious skin reactions; and high blood sugar or worsening diabetes.\nBoth Tafinlar and Mekinist can cause harm to a developing fetus; women should be advised of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception.\nThe FDA granted Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation for this indication. Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases, was also granted for this indication.\nThe FDA granted this approval to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\nFor more information:\nFDA: Office of Hematology and Oncology Products\nFDA: Approved Drugs: Questions and Answers\nFDA: Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review\nNIH: Thyroid Cancer\nMedia Inquiries: Sandy Walsh, 301-796-4669, sandy.walsh@fda.hhs.gov\nConsumer Inquiries: 888-INFO-FDA\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-new-uses-for-two-drugs-administered-together-for-the-treatment-of-braf-positive-anaplastic-thyroid-cancer-300642945.html\nSOURCE U.S. Food and Drug Administration", "external_links": ["http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm054420.htm", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-new-uses-for-two-drugs-administered-together-for-the-treatment-of-braf-positive-anaplastic-thyroid-cancer-300642945.html", "http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/HowtoapplyforOrphanProductDesignation/default.htm", "https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405397.htm", "https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/default.htm", "http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm091745.htm", "https://www.cancer.gov/types/thyroid", "https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405405.htm"], "published": "2018-05-04T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T23:54:16.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
