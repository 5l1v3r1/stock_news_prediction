The currency had sunk to $1.1510 on Tuesday, its lowest since late July 2017.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies dipped 0.1 percent to 94.061 after surging to a near seven-month peak of 95.025 on Tuesday.\nThe U.S. currency traded at 108.730 yen, off a low of 108.115 brushed on Tuesday when risk aversion in the broader markets increased investor demand for its Japanese peer, which is often sought in times of market unrest.\nThe dollar received some support as signs of easing Italian political concerns pulled U.S. Treasury yields up from multi-week lows.\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield stood at 2.847 percent after sliding on Tuesday to 2.759 percent, its lowest since April 11.\nOil prices were elevated after rallying overnight as Russia’s central bank expressed caution on plans to boost oil supply.\nU.S. crude futures inched down 0.2 percent to $68.07 a barrel after gaining 2.2 percent on Wednesday. Prices had fallen to a six-week low of $65.80 a barrel on Tuesday amid concerns that Saudi Arabia and Russia could increase output.\nBrent crude dipped 0.25 percent to $77.31 a barrel after jumping 2.8 percent on Wednesday.\nReporting by Shinichi Saoshiro Editing by Shri Navaratnam\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
