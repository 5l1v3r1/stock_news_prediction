(NASDAQ:TRNC) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nTotal revenues were $355.6 million compared to $366.1 million for first quarter 2017 Circulation revenue for first quarter 2018 was $134.2 million, up 12.2%, compared to the same period of 2017 Digital-only subscribers increased 90% to 342,000 at the end of the first quarter 2018, up from 180,000 at the end of the first quarter 2017 Content revenues for troncX, which includes digital-only subscription revenue, grew 61.7% year-over-year Average monthly unique visitors were 75.3 million in the first quarter 2018, up 28% from the first quarter 2017\n“During the first quarter 2018, we undertook a number of actions that we believe position the company to compete effectively as the media industry continues to evolve,” said tronc Chairman and CEO Justin Dearborn. Dearborn continued, “Key items among these actions include the following:\nThe Company entered into an agreement to sell the Los Angeles Times, San Diego Union-Tribune and other California media titles for $500 million plus the assumption of pension liabilities (the “California transaction”); Acquired a majority ownership stake in BestReviews, a high-growth e-Commerce product review company, with the intention of furthering our revenue diversification strategy and leveraging our existing local media network; Continued the integration of our recent investment in the New York Daily News (NYDN), which included rebuilding the local sales organization and leveraging its state-of-the-art production facility; Executed an agreement with Cars.com transferring sales affiliation and creating a digital advertising partnership; and Implemented our newsroom and sales reorganization plans aimed at positioning us for growth in our local markets”\n“In connection with the California transaction, after-tax cash proceeds will be used to repay all current outstanding corporate debt. Post transaction, we expect to have a significant cash balance that we intend to use to aggressively pursue a continued push into acquiring complementary digital properties and to continue to leverage our scale as we expand our reach.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFirst quarter 2018 total revenues were $355.6 million, down 2.9% compared to $366.1 million for first quarter 2017. Revenue for the first quarter 2018 includes $25.9 million attributable to the NYDN (acquired in September 2017), $3.2 million attributable to BestReviews (acquired in February 2018), and a $14.2 million downward impact associated with a new agreement to convert tronc's eight affiliate markets into Cars.com's direct retail channel, which went into effect on February 1, 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 total advertising revenue and digital advertising revenue were $156.4 million and $30.9 million, respectively, which includes the impact from the Cars.com agreement. Excluding this impact, on a year-over-year basis, total advertising revenue would have been down 9.9%, and digital advertising revenue and would have been up 2.0%.\nTotal operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for first quarter 2018 were $374.4 million, up 5.7%, compared to $354.0 million for first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly due to the impact of including NYDN, partially offset by our ongoing cost reduction programs and reduced expenses related to the Cars.com transition.\nFirst quarter 2018 was impacted by fees associated with a consulting agreement that the Company entered into with Merrick Ventures LLC, Michael W. Ferro, Jr. and Merrick Media, LLC. Following Mr. Ferro’s retirement from the Company’s Board on March 18, 2018, the Company fully expensed the $15.0 million contract in the first quarter, which included $500,000 while Mr. Ferro was actively engaged in the business. Including this charge, net loss for first quarter 2018 was $14.8 million, or $0.42 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.0 million, or $0.08 per share, for first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2018 was $24.4 million, versus $33.7 million in the first quarter 2017, due primarily to an anticipated negative first quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA at the NYDN and digital investments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $21.6 million for first quarter 2018. Capital expenditures totaled $7.2 million for the quarter. Debt was reduced by $5.3 million, and pension and long-term post-retirement liabilities decreased by $9.1 million compared to fourth quarter 2017. Cash balance was $162.7 million, which reflects $33.7 million used for the Best Reviews transaction completed in February 2018. This was the primary driver of an increase in net debt of $22.0 million in first quarter 2018 compared to fourth quarter 2017.\nSegment Results\nThe Company operates in two segments: troncM, which is comprised of the Company’s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related expenses, except digital subscription revenues when bundled with a print subscription, and troncX, which includes all digital revenues and related expenses of the Company from local tronc websites, third party websites, mobile\napplications, digital-only subscriptions, Tribune Content Agency, BestReviews and forsalebyowner.com .\nIncluded in the tables below is segment reporting for troncM and troncX for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017.\ntroncM\nFirst quarter 2018 troncM total revenues were $308.4 million, down 1.0% compared to first quarter 2017. Advertising revenue for first quarter 2018 declined by 12.0% on a year-over-year basis, which was partially offset by an increase of 12.2% in circulation revenues.\nFirst quarter 2018 operating expenses for troncM increased 1.9% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by the inclusion of the NYDN. First quarter 2018 income from operations for troncM was $10.8 million or a 44.1% decline from the prior-year quarter.\ntroncX\nTotal revenues for troncX for the first quarter of 2018 were $48.0 million, down 13.4%, primarily driven by the impact of Cars.com, partially offset by the inclusion of BestReviews. First quarter 2018 advertising revenues for troncX decreased 31.2% compared to the same period of the prior year, however, were up 2.0% excluding the impact from Cars.com. Content revenues in the first quarter 2018, which includes digital-only subscriptions and content syndication, increased by 61.7% year-over-year. First quarter 2018 income from operations for troncX was $1.4 million, a decrease of 66.3% from the prior-year period.\nTotal first quarter 2018 average monthly unique visitors were 75.3 million, up 28% from the prior-year quarter. Digital-only subscribers grew to 342,000, up 90% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company’s 2018 full year guidance excludes revenue and adjusted EBITDA from the Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune and other various California media titles, per the expected close of the sale to Nant Capital. 2018 total revenues are expected to be in a range of $1.00 to $1.03 billion, and 2018 adjusted EBITDA is expected in a range of $100 to $110 million.\nConference Call Details\ntronc will host a conference call to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 results at 5 p.m. Eastern Time (4 p.m. Central Time) on Wednesday, May 9, 2018.

ASU 2017-07 requires certain components of net benefit costs to be presented outside of income from operations. The standard required retrospective application. Accordingly amounts presented in the prior period have been adjusted to conform with the standard.\n(2) - Restructuring and transaction costs include costs related to tronc's internal restructuring, such as severance, charges associated with vacated space, costs related to completed and potential acquisitions and a one-time charge related to the Consulting Agreement.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, income taxes, interest expense, other (expense) income, realized gain (loss) on investments, reorganization items, depreciation and amortization, and other items that the Company does not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, and certain other charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance (including spin-related costs). Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments) and (ii) expenses that are not reflective of the Company’s core operating results over time (such as restructuring costs, including the employee voluntary separation program and gain/losses on employee benefit plan terminations, litigation or dispute settlement charges or gains, and transaction-related costs), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company’s financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance; (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods; and (c) in communications with the Company’s Board of Directors concerning the Company’s financial performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, or a similarly calculated measure, is used as the basis for certain financial maintenance covenants that the Company is subject to in connection with certain credit facilities. Since not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Instead, management believes Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company’s financial measures derived in accordance with GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business.\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are: they do not reflect the Company’s interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company’s debt; they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring and transaction costs, stock-based compensation amounts and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\nTRONC, INC.\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nPreliminary\nReconciliation of Total Operating Expenses to Adjusted Total Operating Expenses:\nThree Months Ended April 1, 2018 Three Months Ended March 26, 2017 GAAP Adjustments Adjusted GAAP Adjustments Adjusted Compensation $ 144,537 $ (8,790 ) $ 135,747 $ 133,147 $ (4,329 ) $ 128,818 Newsprint and ink 22,034 — 22,034 23,524 — 23,524 Outside services 130,559 (20,141 ) 110,418 114,310 (1,891 ) 112,419 Other operating expenses 62,598 430 63,028 69,887 (2,210 ) 67,677 Depreciation and amortization 14,649 (14,649 ) — 13,178 (13,178 ) — Total operating expenses $ 374,377 $ (43,150 ) $ 331,227 $ 354,046 $ (21,608 ) $ 332,438 Adjusted Total Operating Expenses\nAdjusted total operating expenses consist of total operating expenses per the income statement, adjusted to exclude the impact of items listed in the Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP reconciliation.
