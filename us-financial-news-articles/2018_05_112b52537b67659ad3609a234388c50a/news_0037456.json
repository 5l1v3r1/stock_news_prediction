Bollea won a $140 million judgment against Gawker, leading to its bankruptcy.\nHogan later settled for $31 million, and is entitled to 45 percent of the proceeds from asset sales, according to court papers.\nAfter Gawker’s bankruptcy, some of the website’s related businesses, including the Deadspin sports website and feminist blog Jezebel, were bought by Univision Holdings Inc, the Spanish language broadcaster, for $135 million in 2016.
