Figures published by Citi on Monday, the top six Italian banks have a 166.6 billion euros exposure to Italian sovereign debt.\nMajor French banks’ BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole CAGR5YEUAM=MG and Societe Generale SG5YEUAM=MG 5-year CDS also rose sharply, jumping 50 bps or more on the day. BNP Paribas BNPP5YEUAM=MG hit 93 bps - its highest since April 2017.\nTo view a graphic on Italian banks' sovereign bond holdings, click: reut.rs/2J4jMJ6\nReporting by Karin Strohecker, editing by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://reut.rs/2J4jMJ6"], "published": "2018-05-29T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:28:38.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
