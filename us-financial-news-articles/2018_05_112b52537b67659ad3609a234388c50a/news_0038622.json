Opponents argue that unscrupulous caregivers could pressure vulnerable patients to take their own lives.\nOregon was the first to legalize physician-assisted suicide with a statute that took effect in 1998. Since then, some 200 end-of-life prescriptions have been written per year, according to Compassion and Choices, although not all have been used.\nReporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
