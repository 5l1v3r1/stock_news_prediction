In his longest outing of the season, the left-hander recorded his first home win of the year and 150th career victory overall.\nHamels struck out seven, walked two and threw 63 of 100 pitches for strikes. The left-hander threw first-pitch strikes to 18 of the 28 hitters he faced.\nJake Diekman allowed a two-run homer with one out in the eighth to Austin Romine, who entered the game after Gary Sanchez was removed due to calf cramps. After allowing Romine’s hit, Diekman retired Tyler Austin and Miguel Andujar, who each came up representing the tying run.\nKeone Kela tossed a perfect ninth and notched his ninth save in as many opportunities.\nJurickson Profar hit a three-run homer and Ronald Guzman hit a solo shot off Yankees starter Domingo German (0-2) as the Rangers won for the fifth time in their last 13 games on a night when they drew eight walks.\nGerman threw three wild pitches, all in the second inning which resulted in two runs. Robinson Chirinos scored on a wild pitch during a strikeout, and Nomar Mazara hit a run-scoring groundout.\nGerman allowed six runs and four hits over 3 2/3 innings in his third career start. He also became the first Yankee to throw three wild pitches in an inning since Roger Clemens on Sept. 8, 2002, against the Detroit Tigers.\nGleyber Torres and Andujar homered off Hamels for the Yankees, who lost for the fifth time in their last 27 games and were unable to become the first team in baseball history to slug at least four homers in four straight games.\nNew York manager Aaron Boone was also ejected for the first time by plate umpire Pat Hoberg in the sixth.\nTexas opened a 3-0 lead when Profar sent German’s 1-1 fastball over the center field fence with one out in the first. Texas took a 4-0 lead when Chirinos came home on a strikeout to Ryan Rua on a pitch in the dirt.\nAfter German’s third wild pitch, the Rangers loaded the bases and took a 5-0 lead on Mazara’s grounder.\nThe Yankees got a run back in the third when Torres lifted a first-pitch fastball into the left field seats for his seventh homer, but Guzman made it 6-1 when he opened the fourth by sending German’s 0-2 curveball over the right field fence.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:07:30.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
