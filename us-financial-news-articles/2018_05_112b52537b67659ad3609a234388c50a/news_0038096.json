It has expanded its hedging for next year to benefit from current high oil prices.\nIt said it had hedged 21-28 percent of its output through the third quarter of next year at an average price of $66-$67 a barrel. For this year, it insured 40 percent of its oil output at $58-$60 a barrel.\nAfter disposing of assets in the North Sea in recent months, a final investment decision for its Tolmount gas field in the southern North Sea is due in the second half of the year, it said.\nPremier is also working to start its first appraisal well in the Zama field off Mexico with potential reserves of up to 800 million barrels in the fourth quarter, while Mexican firm Pemex is in the process of securing a rig for a well in an adjacent block.
