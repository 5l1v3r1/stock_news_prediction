After closing, legacy Cadence and State Bank shareholders will collectively own approximately 65% and 35% of the combined company, respectively.\nAt closing, three State Bank directors will join the board of Cadence and of Cadence Bank. Joe Evans, Chairman of the State Bank board, will serve as Vice Chairman of Cadence and Tom Wiley, Vice Chairman of the State Bank board, will serve as a director of Cadence and Chairman of Cadence Bank. Additionally, Cadence Bank CEO Sam Tortorici will relocate to Atlanta. Cadence Bank’s corporate headquarters will also move to Atlanta from Birmingham.

State Bank is an impressive organization with talented, experienced and customer-centered bankers,” said Paul B. Murphy, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Cadence. “We are pleased to combine these two strong, growing institutions which have been built on a common vision with shared values. I have enjoyed getting to know Joe, Tom and many of their bankers. When we went public a year ago, we said we wanted to be active with M&A. We said we would be selective and that we were looking for a gem. We found a gem with State Bank. I believe this is going to be an outstanding combination. I see it as a joint win for both company’s shareholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve.”\nSam Tortorici, CEO of Cadence Bank, added: “State Bank brings a significant Georgia presence, which will be an important part of our combined company. I look forward to relocating to the vibrant Atlanta area, where I have spent significant time over my banking career, and to working with the experience and expertise of State Bank’s business leaders. We will work together to ensure our future success in Georgia and as a leading regional banking franchise.”\n\"We are excited to be partnering with Cadence,” said State Bank Chairman Joe Evans. “From this incredible combination of talents and resources will emerge a truly exceptional bank that will be a formidable competitor in the dynamic markets we serve.\"\nCadence expects this acquisition to be ~7% accretive to earnings per common share in 2020, excluding one-time charges, and expects the transaction to deliver strong returns on capital. The transaction is expected to produce approximately 4% tangible book value per share dilution at closing with an earnback period of less than three years.\nThe merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies.
