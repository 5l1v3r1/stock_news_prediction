REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo\nForza Italia was allied with the far-right League in an inconclusive March national election. Berlusconi gave his blessing to his ally to hold talks with 5-Star earlier this month after all other political options appeared blocked.\nHowever, Berlusconi said in a statement that the program drawn up by the two parties was “a naive book of dreams”. He added: “We can do no other than confirm our decision to vote no in the confidence motion and be in opposition...”\nForza Italia’s votes are not necessary for the 5-Star/League coalition to obtain a majority in parliament.
