It said every business unit was under review, while announcing Chairman John Kain’s departure and cost cuts.\n“That’s very unusual, perhaps Glaucus are right,” said Michael McCarthy, Chief Markets Strategist at stockbroker CMC Markets. “If that does prove to be the case then you’d have to suggest that overall they’ve done that market a favour.”\nAggressive shorting is relatively new in Australia, but it is here to stay, McCarthy added. RISING ACTIVISM\nBlue Sky is the second firm to be targeted by Glaucus in Australia, after sandalwood company Quintis.\nQuintis had been reeling since March 2017 when the U.S.-based activist short-seller published a highly negative report, describing shares in the company as worthless. It called in administrators in January.\nGlaucus still has a short position in Blue Sky, a local paper, The Australian, quoted the head of research at Glaucus, Soren Aandahl, as saying on Monday.\nThe U.S. short seller did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.\nBlue Sky has mostly struggled to fend off Glaucus’ attacks, with its trading updates lacking the kind of hard financial information needed to restore investors’ confidence.\nThe company’s managing director, Robert Shand, resigned last month and two other directors stepped down from the board.\nKain will step down as Blue Sky’s chairman once a successor is appointed, which the company aims to achieve before its annual general meeting scheduled for Oct. 15\nBlue Sky stock closed down 8 percent at a four-year low of A$2.50 on Monday, dropping below Glaucus’ valuation of A$2.66. The broader market rose 0.4 percent. ($1 = 1.3319 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Tom Westbrook in SYDNEY.
