Trump and the Saudis have criticized the deal for provisions that begin to expire in 2025, potentially allowing Iran to scale back up its nuclear program, and for not addressing Iran’s ballistic missile program and interventions in Syria and Yemen.\nBy Asa Fitch Margherita Stancati\nIran’s president said his country would fiercely resist efforts to contain its regional influence as President Donald Trump weighs withdrawing from the nuclear deal, a scenario that threatens to escalate the country’s destabilizing rivalry with Saudi Arabia.\nIn defiant speeches on Monday and over the weekend, President Hassan Rouhani offered the clearest glimpse yet of how his country plans to react if Trump withdraws from the nuclear pact by a self-imposed deadline on Saturday. Rouhani rejected a series of concessions demanded by the Saudis and the U.S., including limits on Iran’s ballistic missile program—which isn’t covered in the nuclear pact—and its interference across the Middle East. ‘If the U.S.’s goal is for our country to have no independence and influence in the region, our people will stand against them fiercely as they have done over the past 40 years.’ President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech broadcast on state television\nDon’t miss: Here’s what sanctions on Iran could do to global oil supply and prices\nSaudi Arabia and its young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, see ending the nuclear deal as a vital element of curbing Iran’s rising role in Syria, Yemen and other Middle Eastern trouble spots. Already emboldened by Trump’s hard line on Tehran, Saudi Arabia has moved to dilute Iran’s sway in Iraq and Lebanon. The kingdom now says it is contemplating contributing troops to stabilize Syria—a place the Saudis had once considered a lost cause.
