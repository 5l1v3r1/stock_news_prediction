What can you do with a little budget? You have to be creative,” she said.\nWorking with businesses to sponsor local parks or to take responsibility for street lights is a cost-effective way of funding schemes and giving private sector companies a vested interest in protecting their areas, she said.\nPublic education and outreach programs help communities get more involved, said Serrano, who has appeared on local television and radio shows to publicize resilience efforts.\nRapid, haphazard growth in informal neighborhoods has left many people with inadequate access to services and infrastructure, Serrano told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nMajor challenges include improving the city’s drinking water supply and waste management system, she said.\nReporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Jared Ferrie.
