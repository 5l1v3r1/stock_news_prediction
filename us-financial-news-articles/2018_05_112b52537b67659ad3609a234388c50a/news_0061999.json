It’s going to be a different kind of golf tournament for sure.”\nJazz has vivid memories of watching his idol Tiger Woods play at the event in 2007.\n“My father brought me to watch Tiger at Carnoustie when I was 10, so earning my major debut to play at the same venue this year makes me feel really special,” Jazz added.\n“I’ve never played there before, so I need to expect the unexpected and go there with an open mind.\n“My parents will be heading over with me so I am looking forward to it. Playing in a major is every professional golfer’s dream. I can’t wait to be there.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:27:23.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
