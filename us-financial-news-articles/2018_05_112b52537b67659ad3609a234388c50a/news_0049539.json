Ratings have dipped a little bit,” Dorfman said, adding the NFL is “still one of the strongest live events you can buy in television.”\nThe protests, in a league where African-Americans make up the majority of players, continued for much of the past season, with some players kneeling when the anthem was played and others standing arm-in-arm in solidarity.

Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the protests in 2016, and when he was shunned by all 32 teams in the league, going unsigned for the entire 2017 season, players and commentators questioned whether he was being blackballed by the owners.\nHe has filed a grievance against the league.\nThe protests started to fizzle late in the season when the NFL said it would donate $89 million over seven years to social justice causes.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\nThe NFL last year rejected Trump’s calls to punish players who protest, but said the league’s players “should” stand during the anthem.\nGoodell, in Wednesday’s statement, defended the patriotism of NFL players.

This is not and was never the case,” the commissioner said.\nThe players’ union also said NFL players “have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.” Reporting by Daniel Trotta; additional reporting by Andrew Both; editing by G Crosse", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:48:55.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
