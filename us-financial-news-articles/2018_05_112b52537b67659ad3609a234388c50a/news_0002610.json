Adjacent OEM market sales grew to $142 million for the quarter, up 50 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Aftermarket sales rose to $50 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 39 percent from the first quarter of 2017. We remain optimistic, as April 2018 consolidated net sales are approximately $245 million, 46 percent higher than April 2017. Our continuing growth story is a testament to the focus of our more than 11,000 team members. Industry growth continued its trend from 2017 and remained strong as wholesale recreational vehicle (\"RVs\") shipments were up 13 percent in the first quarter. Sales momentum has continued as the industry attracts a new generation of RV enthusiasts, supported by strong economic growth and consumer confidence. Orders remain strong as dealer sentiment remains bullish and OEMs continue to add capacity to meet demand.\"\n\"Our content per travel trailer and fifth-wheel increased eight percent year-over-year, the largest annual increase since 2012, and our content per motorhome increased 15 percent year-over-year, representing our fourth straight year of double-digit content growth for motorhomes,\" said Scott Mereness, LCI's President. \"We continue to invest in lean manufacturing and automation to improve the efficiency of our operations and meet industry growth demands while managing one of the most volatile commodities environments in recent history due to the new steel and aluminum tariffs. Although operating margin improved from the last two quarters of 2017, raw materials inflation, at least partially caused by the new tariffs, more than offset the margin improvement from our operational and pricing initiatives. Additional price increases will take effect in the coming months and we continue to work with our customers to implement our cost-based pricing strategies.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nConsolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $650 million, a 31 percent increase over 2017 first quarter net sales of $498 million. Net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $47.3 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, compared to net income of $43.1 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in year-over-year net sales reflects industry-wide growth in wholesale shipments of towable and motorized RVs by OEMs, which increased 15 percent and seven percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018, enhanced by solid growth in content per unit and acquisitions. Net sales from acquisitions completed by the Company over the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, contributed $53 million in the first quarter of 2018. The organic growth rate was 20 percent for the first quarter and acquisitions provided the remainder of the 31 percent increase. Through continued focus on aftermarket channels for the Company's products, the Company increased net sales to the aftermarket in the first quarter of 2018 by 39 percent to $50 million.\nThe health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand, which is up eight percent through February 2018, as reported by Statistical Surveys, Inc., and will likely be revised upwards in future months as various states report. Based on the retail sales strength experienced through early 2018, as well as sales order backlogs reported by RV OEMs at record levels, the current outlook from several RV OEMs and their dealer networks remains very positive. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association's current forecast for 2018 estimates a year-over-year increase of seven percent to approximately 540,000 units.\nThe Company's content per travel trailer and fifth-wheel RV for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, increased $259 to $3,317, compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, of $3,058. This is the largest increase in five years for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RV content. The Company's content per motorhome RV for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, increased $306 to $2,328, compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, of $2,022. The content increases are a result of organic growth, including new product introductions, as well as acquisitions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 19 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 26 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in effective tax rate was driven by the newly enacted tax rates from the Tax Cut and Job's Act, offset by a reduction in excess tax benefit from prior year.\nBalance Sheet and Other Items\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $5 million, a decrease of $21 million from its cash and cash equivalents balance of $26 million at the beginning of the year, primarily as a result of $139 million used for acquisitions, $26 million for capital expenditures and $14 million of dividend payments in 2018. The Company's outstanding debt was $226 million at March 31, 2018.\nConference Call & Webcast\nLCI will provide an online, real-time webcast of its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call on the Company's website, www.lci1.com/investors , on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nInstitutional investors can access the call via the password-protected site, StreetEvents ( www.streetevents.com ).
