FETO is the term the Turkish government uses to describe Gulen’s network.\nHalkbank has so far declined to comment on the sentencing. It has previously said that all of its transactions were lawful.\nGulen, who has lived in the United States since 1999, has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it. Washington’s unwillingness to extradite Gulen - it says extradition requests must go through the courts - has infuriated Ankara.\nShares of Halkbank rose more than 8 percent in early trade in Istanbul. They were up 2 percent at 0900 GMT.\nU.S. prosecutors accused Atilla of joining a plot led by Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, who U.S. authorities arrested in 2016 and later pleaded guilty to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges. Zarrab testified for several days as the prosecutors’ star witness against Atilla.\nAtilla has already spent 14 months in jail since his arrest last year. That time will count toward his sentence, and he may be freed early for good behavior.
