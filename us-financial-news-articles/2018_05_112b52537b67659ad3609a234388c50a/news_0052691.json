Bulgaria says it intends to formally apply to join the ERM II by the end of June.\nWith low inflation, sound public finances and its lev currency pegged to the euro, Bulgaria meets the nominal criteria for euro membership but still needs to make its economy more like those of the richer Western countries.\n\"It is logical to expect that a country with such a record should not be blocked, but rather welcomed to start its journey towards joining the euro area through the participation of the lev ... in the exchange rate mechanism II,\" Radev wrote in the introduction to a report that was also published on the central bank's website. ( here )\nThe assessments by the ECB and the EU’s executive Commission’s view are likely to slow but not stop Sofia’s efforts to become the 20th euro zone member.\nExisting euro zone countries are also concerned about admitting Bulgaria soon given its relatively low income levels and widespread corruption, and the possible impact of membership on the stability of Bulgarian banks.\nBulgaria’s gross domestic product per capita, calculated as power purchasing parity, is 49 percent of the EU average, well below euro zone member states. The country also ranks as most corrupt EU country according to Transparency International.\nAddressing such concerns, Radev said in the foreword to policy think-tank OMFIF’s Global Public Investor report, he believed the timing of euro adoption would depend economic convergence and that ERM-2 membership could foster reforms.\nHe said Bulgaria’s banking sector is healthy, with capital adequacy and liquidity exceeding the EU averages.\n“There are structural and institutional policies that need to be implemented and consistently pursued, in order to speed up real convergence,” Radev wrote. “Thus the process of euro area accession, starting with the participation of the national currency in the ERM II, will be a catalyst for further improvements, adjustments and reforms.” (Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova, Editing by Catherine Evans)", "external_links": ["http://www.bnb.bg/PressOffice/POStatements/POADate/02_RADEV_20180523_EN"], "published": "2018-05-25T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:08:05.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
