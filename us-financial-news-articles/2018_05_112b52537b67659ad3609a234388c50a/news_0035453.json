The company in a press release said it would decide the next course of action after studying the detailed orders of NCLT.\nUnder India’s bankruptcy law, insolvency resolution needs to be completed within a maximum 9 months, failing which the company is liquidated.\nWith debt of 457.33 billion rupees ($6.7 billion) at the end of March 2017, RCom is the most-leveraged of all listed telecoms carriers in India.\nThe company shut down its consumer mobile business late last year.\nRCom’s asset sale plan has also stalled as it faces a separate legal challenge after HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd filed a petition accusing the company of oppression of minority shareholders and operational mismanagement.\nRCom shares closed down 8.2 percent on Tuesday in a broader Mumbai market that ended largely unchanged. The company is set to report earning for the quarter ended March on May 19.
