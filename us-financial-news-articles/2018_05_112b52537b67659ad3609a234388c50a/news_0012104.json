AAPL 3.65% to direct traffic to its search business are kept under tight wraps by both companies. But the fees appear to have played a notable role in the iPhone maker’s most recent quarter . In its quarterly filing with the SEC on Wednesday, Apple named licensing as the top contributor to the 31% year-over-year jump in services revenue the company reported for its fiscal second period ended March 31. Licensing for Apple includes more than just the money coming from its Silicon Valley rival, though several analysts believe Google is the most significant contributor to this part of the business.\nWhether that kind of growth will continue is another question. Alphabet has told its own investors that it expects growth in the traffic acquisition costs paid to distribution partners —which include Apple—to start slowing this year, at least relative to revenue from this part of the business. That could mean limited future upside for Apple from what is a lucrative revenue stream.\nBut don’t expect either company to shine more light on it. More searches mean more ad revenue for Google. But traffic acquisition costs paid to distribution partners are a significant expense. Those fees totaled $2.9 billion for the March quarter—up 61% year over year and the equivalent of 13.2% of revenue from the company’s owned properties compared with 10.4% for the same period last year. Changes in “partner agreements” were cited as a major reason for the jump. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein estimates Google paid Apple more than $3 billion for licensing in 2017, which would be about one-third of Google’s distribution traffic acquisition costs for the year.\nThat would also amount to a little under 10% of Apple’s total service revenue for the period. But such payments would have a larger impact on the company’s bottom line, offsetting some other service components like music streaming that carry lower profit margins than the company’s average. Ben Schachter of Macquarie estimates margins on the fast-growing Apple Music business average around 15%, but he noted in an interview that Apple’s licensing revenues “are almost pure profit.”\nThat is a nice gift for Apple that won’t be going away anytime soon, even if the growth seen of late starts to slow. But it is also an uncomfortable reality to acknowledge, given Mr. Cook’s frequent criticisms of his Big Tech peers who generate most of their business through online advertising. He reminded investors in Apple’s earnings call this week that the company makes most of its money on device sales, adding that “you are not our product.” At least not directly.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T14:49:39.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
