The Jets can advance to their first conference final if they win Game 6 at home Monday night.\nConnor put Winnipeg ahead for good at 12:30 of the second period, just 82 seconds after Yannick Weber pushed the Predators into a tie with his first goal of the postseason. Connor, who led all rookies with 31 goals, roofed a rebound for his first tally in 10 playoff games.\nTeammate Blake Wheeler said of Connor, “I’m so happy for him. A young player used to putting the puck in the net, and when it doesn’t happen right away, especially in your first taste of playoff action, it can be tough to stay with it, but his confidence hasn’t wavered a bit. He’s been chomping at the bit, and tonight was his turn.”\nDustin Byfuglien bombed a slapper from the point for a 3-1 lead at 14:35 of the middle period for his fourth playoff goal. Connor converted Blake Wheeler’s sweet feed into the slot to make it 4-1 at 17:01, stunning the sellout crowd.\nNashville responded with a short-handed goal from Ryan Johansen at 17:59 when he converted a two-on-one rush with a wrister that squirted in off goalie Connor Hellebuyck. That appeared to give the Predators some life going into the second intermission.\nHowever, the Jets regained the momentum just 28 seconds into the third period. Connor’s backhand feed into the slot set up Mark Scheifele for his ninth playoff goal.\nMathieu Perreault sent Rinne to the bench with a power-play marker at 6:23 of the third period, his first goal of the postseason. Rinne finished with 20 saves on 26 shots, while backup Juuse Saros stopped all six shots he faced.\nHellebuyck earned the win with 38 saves, including 11 in a first period that saw Nashville carry play for the most part, producing four high-danger chances that were denied.\nWinnipeg appeared to gain traction about five minutes into the second period, initiating the scoring when Patrik Laine’s blast from the left circle hit off Paul Stastny’s hand and found the net at 7:44.\nFrom there, the Jets simply took off.\nPredators coach Peter Laviolette said of having to win in Winnipeg on Monday to extend the series, “(My) group’s been built for a game like the one that’s coming up. I’ve got a tremendous amount of confidence. I believe in them. I know that they believe in each other. Winnipeg’s a good team. We’re going to have to go in there, we’re going to have to play well and we’re going to have to win a hockey game.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-06T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:53:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
