Ting Shen | Xinhua | Getty Images Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve\nMarkets are becoming more convinced that the Federal Reserve is about to get more aggressive on interest rates.\nThe probability that the central bank will raise its benchmark rate a fourth time this year went above 50 percent for the first time, according to the CME's FedWatch tracking tool for the fed funds futures market.\nFutures contracts are currently implying a funds rate of 2.21 percent from the current range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.
