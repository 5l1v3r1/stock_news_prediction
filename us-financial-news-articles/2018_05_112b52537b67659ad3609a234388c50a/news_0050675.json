T.J. Maxx and Homegoods owner TJX , Dollar General , Five Below and CVS had a prominent presence and there were more restaurant and hotel operators than there was in past years, attendees said. Amid all the chatter about Bon-Ton's and Toys R Us' recent and ongoing liquidations, the mood at RECon this year was much more upbeat than past years, when developers and retailers alike were still crawling their way back out from the damage done during the Great Recession, Greg Maloney, head of JLL's Americas retail business, told CNBC. \"The sky is the limit for what you can do\" with dark space at the mall or within shopping centers, he said. \"You don't have to fill retail with retail anymore.\" Apartment complexes and hotels were two of the new uses that some of the biggest retail landlords had top of mind this week. Simon, a top-tier U.S. mall owner, announced during the show its plans to open at least five Marriott International hotels at its properties over the next several years. PREIT , which has a smaller portfolio of malls primarily in the Northeast, said earlier this week that it would be looking to add as many as 7,000 residential units and 3,000 hotel units across a dozen properties in the coming years, too. \"Our business is requiring new creativity that's never been required before,\" PREIT CEO Joe Coradino told CNBC. The marketplace today, especially with younger generations of shoppers, is seeking centers where people can live, work, shop and dine, he said. CLOSE When Toys R’ Us announced plans to close all 735 of its U.S. stores this month, it wasn’t exactly a surprise. In February, Build-A-Bear announced its fourth straight year of profitability. Here's how it's surviving. Time Coradino, along with other mall REIT CEOs at the show, agreed that more malls are transitioning to \"mixed use\" spaces. Fitness operators, spa service providers and other entertainment venue owners also flooded the Las Vegas Convention Center's halls this week. \"Experience is not just food,\" Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, told CNBC. Sure, mall owners are looking to add more food and beverage options at their properties, along with remodeling outdated food courts , but there are plenty of other \"experiential tenants\" to fill old department store boxes. She said she was most impressed with the amount of health and wellness initiatives being talked about at the conference this year — a category that isn't easily disrupted by Amazon . Gregg Knoop, chief development officer of children's theme park chain KidZania, was seen making the rounds, meeting with U.S. mall and property owners like Seritage , a real estate investment trust looking specifically for ways to redevelop the Sears stores in its portfolio. (During the conference, Seritage signed a deal with gym owner Equinox to fill an old Sears store.) \"I've walked away from this conference with more inspiration than I have in a while,\" Weinswig said. \"Landlords and their tenants are finally working together.\" © CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
