Our products and people are world-class and I am excited to share my knowledge of the beverage industry to move the company forward with even greater success. I am confident in our collective ability to excel and am proud to assume leadership of this great organization.”\nAbout Great Western Brewing Company\nThe brewery was built in Saskatoon in 1927 and operated under the name Hub City Brewing Company, becoming the Western Canada Brewing Company in 1930 and then Drewery’s Limited in 1932. It was acquired by O’Keefe Brewing in 1956 and remained so until 1989 when O’Keefe amalgamated with Molson Brewing Company. The intended closure of the facility created an opportunity for employees. They pooled their resources and on March 26, 1990 launched the Great Western Brewing Company. These “original 16” founders established what is now one of Saskatchewan’s true business successes.\nGreat Western Brewing Company Limited is Saskatchewan owned and operated and distributes product to western provinces from Manitoba to British Columbia.\nwww.gwbc.ca\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515005953/en/\nGreat Western Brewing Company Ltd.\nMichael Shaw\nChairman of the Board\ninfo@gwbc.ca\nSource: Great Western Brewing Company", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515005953/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gwbc.ca&esheet=51804610&newsitemid=20180515005953&lan=en-US&anchor=www.gwbc.ca&index=2&md5=393d543a3d7f0e2f7463a5e392e9625c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gwbc.ca&esheet=51804610&newsitemid=20180515005953&lan=en-US&anchor=Great+Western+Brewing+Company&index=1&md5=6c19922869005f6b06329fbcadfce171"], "published": "2018-05-15T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:21:33.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
