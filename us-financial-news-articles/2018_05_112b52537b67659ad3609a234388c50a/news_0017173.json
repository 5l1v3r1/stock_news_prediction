(NYSE American:BKJ) (the “Company”), holding company for Bank of New Jersey (the “Bank”), today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.34 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.06 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.7 million, an increase of $669,000 or 11.07%, compared to $6.0 million for the same period of 2017. Total loans were $723.8 million at March 31, 2018, up $2.6 million, from the December 31, 2017 balance of $721.2 million. Total assets of the Company at March 31, 2018 were $857.5 million, a decrease of 3.37% from $887.4 million at December 31, 2017. Total deposits were $759.0 million at March 31, 2018, down $29.3 million, or 3.72% from the December 31, 2017 balance of $788.3 million.\nNancy E. Graves, Bancorp of New Jersey’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are very pleased with the increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2018, which is attributable to the strong loan growth last year. The increase in total loans, along with an increase in our net interest rate spread, expanded our net interest margin to 3.10% at March 31, 2018, from 2.93% at December 31, 2017. Commercial loan growth in the first quarter of 2018 was modest, but our pipeline remains active. On the deposit front, we experienced a cyclical decline in municipal and government deposits attributable to real estate tax payments. We remain focused on driving organic deposits higher with free checking products and fixed rate offerings. The market is highly competitive but we are pleased with our new business and personal account activity.”\nThe following tables show information regarding our loan and deposit portfolios:\nPeriod Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 Loan Composition Commercial Real Estate $ 582,890 $ 573,941 Residential Mortgages 64,685 66,497 Commercial and Industrial 26,250 27,237 Home Equity 49,729 53,199 Consumer 235 317 Total Loans 723,789 721,191 Deferred Loan Fees and Costs, net (786 ) (798 ) Allowance for Loan Losses (8,111 ) (8,317 ) Net Loans $ 714,892 $ 712,076 Deposit Composition Noninterest-Bearing Demand Deposits $ 136,938 $ 133,661 Savings and Interest-Bearing Transaction Accounts 271,293 307,583 Time Deposits $250 and under 231,148 231,224 Time Deposits over $250 119,617 115,825 Total Deposits $ 758,996 $ 788,293 First Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nNet Income\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.34 million compared to net income of $1.06 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net income for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income due to loan growth and a decrease in the tax expense related to a lower federal corporate tax rate in 2018 provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) signed in to law on December 22, 2017, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expenses and a $325,000 provision for loan losses recognized by the Company in the first quarter of 2018, while no provision was recognized for the same period in 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nFor the three month period ended March 31, 2018, net interest income increased by $669,000 or 11.07% versus the same period last year. Interest income increased by $916,000, or 11.78% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the corresponding period last year. This increase in interest income was primarily due to loan growth and higher interest received on cash and investment balances due to rising interest rates.\nTotal interest expense increased by $247,000 in the first quarter of 2018 to $2.0 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates as market rates continue to increase in our market area, and we continue to face significant competition for deposits.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recognized a provision for loan losses of $325,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to no provision in the three months ended March 30, 2017. The provision recognized in 2018 was mainly due to a sale of three non-performing loans in the first quarter of 2018. The allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.12% as of the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense was $4.7 million during the first quarter of 2018, up from $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $202 thousand or 4.5%. The increase was primarily in salaries and employee benefits, data processing, occupancy and equipment expenses and legal fees, partially offset by decreases in professional fees and FDIC premiums and related expenses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits costs is associated with health insurance premium increases, annual increases and executive stock awards expenses. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense is related to the relocation of the corporate offices located in Englewood Cliffs. The decrease in professional fees is mainly attributable to non-recurring consulting fees related to enhancing the Company’s risk management system in the prior year.\nFinancial Condition\nAt March 31, 2018, the Bank maintained capital ratios that were in excess of regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions. The Company’s and Bank’s Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio was 9.68%, common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets were both 10.97% and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 12.05%.\nTotal consolidated assets decreased by $29.9 million, or 3.37%, from $887.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $857.5 million at March 31, 2018, reflecting a decrease in deposits.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents decreased from $92.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $61.1 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $31.5 million. The change in cash is mainly due to the decrease in deposit account balances.\nLoans receivable, or “total loans,” increased from $721.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $723.8 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $2.6 million.\nTotal deposits decreased by $29.3 million to $759.0 million at March 31, 2018, from $788.3 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease is mainly due to outflows of government and municipal deposits attributable to the cyclical nature of real estate tax collections and payments, which may have been compounded this quarter due to the timing of the Tax Act and its impact on payments of local municipal taxes.\nLoan Quality\nAt March 31, 2018 the Bank had non-accrual loans of $16.8 million. Included in this total are $8.9 million in Troubled Debt Restructured Loans (“TDRs”). At year-end 2017, non-accrual loans totaled $18.4 million. The reduction in non-accrual loans was mainly due to a sale of three non-performing loans in the first quarter of 2018. Accruing loans delinquent greater than 30 days were $8.3 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $6.3 million at December 31, 2017. Of the $8.3 million in delinquent loans at March 31, 2018, five loans totaling $4.4 million reached maturity and were in the process of extension or renewal.\nAbout the Company\nFounded in 2006, Bancorp of New Jersey is the holding company for Bank of New Jersey, which provides traditional commercial and consumer banking products and services.
