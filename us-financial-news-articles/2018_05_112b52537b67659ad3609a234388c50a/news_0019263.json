That compares with a profit of 45 million riyals in the same period a year ago.\nEFG Hermes and Al Rajhi Capital had forecast the firm would make a loss of 42.5 million riyals and a loss of 33 million riyals, respectively.\nZain Saudi’s lost around 1.7 million subscribers in the first quarter, falling 17 percent to 8.4 million. The company said this was in line with a country-wide decrease.\nSaudi Telecom last month reported a 2.1 percent increase in first quarter net profit to 2.59 billion riyals and Mobily reduced its quarterly losses to 93 million riyals.\nZain Saudi quarterly revenue fell 12 percent to 1.69 billion riyals, which it blamed on a decrease in the rate other carriers pay to end calls on its network and a drop in international traffic.
