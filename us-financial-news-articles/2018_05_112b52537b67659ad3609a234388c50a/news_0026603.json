Revenue fell 17 percent to $17.6 million.\nCeva in the quarter began reporting using a new revenue recognition standard known as ASC 606 that affects how the company reports royalties.\nAccording to the previous reporting standard, revenue was $19.5 million and adjusted earnings were 11 cents a share.\nThe company, a licensor of signal processing platforms and artificial intelligence processors, was forecast to earn 11 cents a share on revenue of $18.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nCeva said analysts’ estimates were compiled according to the old accounting standard.\nCeva said it signed 14 licensing agreements in the quarter including two customers for its new NeuPro AI processor used in autonomous driving systems.\n“In our royalty business, the market experienced excess channel inventory in the low tier smartphone and feature phone markets, which resulted in weaker than expected baseband shipments in the first quarter,” CEO Gideon Wertheizer said.
