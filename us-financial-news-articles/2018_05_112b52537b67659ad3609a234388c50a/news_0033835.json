(NASDAQ:AMR) (“Alta Mesa Resources”, the “Company” or “Alta Mesa”) today provided an operations update, including a review of the Company’s first quarter production and operational performance for its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“AMHLP”) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher”). A conference call to discuss these items is scheduled for today at 2 p.m. central time (888-347-8149). Prior to the call, a supplemental slide deck to be used on the call will be available in the investor relations portion of the Company’s website at www.altamesa.net . As a result of the recent complex business combination, the Company has determined additional time is required to complete the financial presentation of the predecessor and successor entities. Therefore, it will not release First Quarter 2018 financials today but expects to do so shortly.\nOperational Highlights\nCompleted business combination on February 9, creating pure-play STACK-focused company 1Q-2018 net production 24,000 BOE per day, up 9% from 4Q-2017 Exited Q1 with average net production of 25,800 BOE per day in March 8th rig added in May to support full year plan Expanded Kingfisher Midstream leadership and business development team 200 MMCFD Kingfisher Midstream plant expansion placed in service in April Launched Cimarron Express crude pipeline to Cushing Ended quarter with $261 million in cash for total liquidity in excess of $700 million\nHal Chappelle, Alta Mesa’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “After we closed our deal in early February, we hit the ground running to leverage our extensive experience in the low-cost STACK oil window. For the balance of the first quarter, we have generated solid results as we scale up and realize additional operating efficiencies. We continue to ramp up activity in our STACK play with a focus on multi-well pad development, including the addition of an eighth rig.” Chappelle continued; “We have a balance sheet that is capable of supporting our growth agenda and an integrated platform with Kingfisher Midstream to de-risk upstream growth and capture additional value for Alta Mesa. All of this leads us to be optimistic about our vision for Alta Mesa and how this represents a differentiated opportunity for investors.”\nAMHLP Upstream STACK Play Activities\nIn AMHLP ’s STACK play, the company has assembled a highly contiguous leasehold position of over 130,000 net acres. In the first quarter of 2018, AMHLP completed 28 horizontal wells in the Mississippian-age Meramec/Osage section; 15 of the wells were funded through a DrillCo with Bayou City Energy. AMHLP currently has eight rigs operating in the STACK play area with plans to maintain this level for the balance of 2018. In total, AMHLP plans to drill between 170 and 180 gross wells during the year.\nKingfisher Midstream Activities\nKingfisher executed a definitive agreement to form Cimarron Express Pipeline, LLC (“Cimarron Express”) with Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (“BKEP”). The 50/50 partnership will construct and operate a new 16-inch, 65-mile crude oil pipeline extending from northeastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, to BKEP’s Cushing, Oklahoma, crude oil terminal. The Cimarron Express Pipeline will provide direct market access at Cushing for STACK producers and will have an initial capacity of 90,000 barrels per day, expandable to over 175,000 barrels per day, and is expected to be completed in mid-2019. The 200 MMcf per day plant expansion at Kingfisher was placed in service in April. Kingfisher’s operated inlet capacity is now 260 MMcf per day.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Production Summary\nTotal production for the first quarter of 2018 was 2,162 MBOE, or an average of 24.0 MBOE per day, up 24%, compared to 1,737 MBOE or 19.3 MBOE per day in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in production is primarily a result of the continued successful development of AMHLP’s STACK play. AMHLP production for 2018 is expected to average between 33 and 38 MBOE per day.\nConference Call Information\nAlta Mesa invites you to listen to its conference call which will discuss its operational results at 2:00 p.m., Central time, on Monday, May 14, 2018.
