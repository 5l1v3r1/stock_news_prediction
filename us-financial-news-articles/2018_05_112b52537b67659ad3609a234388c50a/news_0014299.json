The machines are guided by inputs from artists and optical sensors to paint in fine detail in lines thinner than a human eyelash.\n“I literally think of that robot as a friend,” Furnas said in an interview. “More than a pet, less than an art assistant - somewhere in there.”\nHe has used a robot called “sozo,” which means imagination in Japanese, for tasks such as painting thousands of hairs on a bison in one of his artworks.\nIt leaves marks on a canvas according to his instructions that he communicates through an optical tracking system attached to a paintbrush-like rod.\nIt records a painter’s movements, allowing artists to edit brushstrokes before putting an image on a canvas. Those digital images can be combined with brushwork from an artist to bring new dimensions to a painting.\nSozo was created by technology startup Artmatr, whose CEO Ben Tritt is a painter. He sees the company as an open-source community that will help artists merge digital technology with traditional painting methods.\nBesides Sozo, Artmatr also has a variety of machines that use ink jet heads found in printers.\n“It lowers the risk threshold for individual mark making,” Furnas said.\nJon Herskovitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T19:30:27.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
