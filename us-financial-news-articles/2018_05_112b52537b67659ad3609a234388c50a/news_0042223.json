Lee is the top shareholder.\nThe Incheon-based drugmaker said Biogen would exercise its call option to increase its stake to 50 percent minus one share, from about 5.4 percent, in loss-making joint venture Samsung Bioepis by late June.\nSamsung BioLogics’ valuation of Samsung Bioepis jumped 18 times to about $4.5 billion in 2015 after it switched to valuing the unlisted firm at fair market value instead of book value, a result of it being treated as an affiliate instead of a unit.\nBioLogics has denied any wrongdoing and said the change was necessary to reflect different accounting standards in the event its partner exercised its call option.\nThe accounting switch helped BioLogis swing to a profit just ahead of its $2 billion IPO in 2016, raising concerns with regulators.\nSamsung Group, South Korea’s top conglomerate, has been touting its biological drugs business as a new growth engine amid a slowdown in the global smartphone market.
