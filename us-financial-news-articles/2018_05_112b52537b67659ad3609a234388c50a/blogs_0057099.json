The show has been critically lauded, with a complex plot and gritty approach to space travel that earned it comparisons to HBO’s Game of Thrones . Yet, The Expanse never generated anything like Thrones -level ratings for SyFy, underperforming even the network’s other niche dramas, such as The Magicians and Krypton .\nPerhaps more damaging to The Expanse ’s status at SyFy, though, was that, according to Deadline Hollywood , the network only had first-run rights to the show. SyFy streams episodes of the current third season, but the first two seasons of The Expanse stream on Amazon’s Prime Video service.\nThat means SyFy didn’t stand to capture revenues from prior seasons of The Expanse as new viewers discovered the show, giving it less motivation to keep the show alive. Serialized and plot-heavy shows like The Expanse have thrived in the binge-streaming era, as services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video make it easy for new fans to catch up. That seems to particularly benefit cerebral sci-fi, a genre Amazon has already announced major new investments in. SyFy’s own streaming efforts, meanwhile, have had some stumbles, with its app criticized by viewers citing technical issues and excessive advertising.\nAt the broadest level, then, the migration of The Expanse from cable to a streaming service can be seen as an index of the acceleration in “cord cutting,” or consumers switching from cable to streaming services. SyFy, with its smaller individual platform, couldn’t fully leverage a highly respected show, while Amazon thinks it can do much better – and has data from streams of prior seasons to back up that bet.
