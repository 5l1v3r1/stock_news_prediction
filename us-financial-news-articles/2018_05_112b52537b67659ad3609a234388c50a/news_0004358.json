Foley, II. \"We feel our title business is well positioned as we enter the seasonally stronger spring and summer months.\n\"In January, our board decided to raise our first quarter 2018 cash dividend to $0.30 per share, an 11% increase from the fourth quarter 2017 dividend of $0.27, which itself was an 8% increase from our third quarter 2017 dividend of $0.25. We continue to seek ways to maximize the return of value to our shareholders.\n\"In March, we announced the acquisition of Stewart Information Services. Since that announcement, we have begun the regulatory process necessary to get the deal approved. There are a number of state and federal filings needed, but the two major filings are the HSR Antitrust filing and the Form A filings with the states of Texas and New York, as those are the states of domicile for the two major Stewart underwriters. We made the initial HSR filing on March 30, 2018, and will work through the anticipated information requests over the coming months. We filed the Form A's with Texas and New York on April 27, 2018, and will wait for any feedback or information requests from those states.\n\"Also, over the last six weeks or so, our management and Stewart management have held more than twenty town hall style meetings for Stewart employees at locations around the country. At those employee meetings, we reiterated our intent to preserve the Stewart legacy as a part of our long-time, successful strategy of operating multiple title insurance brands under the FNF umbrella. The meetings were well received and we consistently heard the employee excitement of putting the prolonged uncertainty that has existed at Stewart behind them and a desire to getting back to a focus on their customers and growing their brand.\"\nConference Call\nWe will host a call with investors and analysts to discuss first quarter 2018 FNF results on Thursday, May 3, 2018, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

More information about FNF can be found at fnf.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, FNF has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted pre-tax earnings, adjusted pre-tax earnings from continuing operations, adjusted pre-tax earnings as a percentage of adjusted revenue (adjusted pre-tax title margin), adjusted pre-tax earnings from continuing operations as a percentage of adjusted revenue (adjusted pre-tax title margin from continuing operations). adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, adjusted EPS and adjusted EPS from continuing operations.\nAny non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FNF's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided below.\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
