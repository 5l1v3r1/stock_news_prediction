Operating costs and expenses decreased year-over-year due to lower stream GEOs sold during the quarter. Oil & Gas revenue increased 74.3% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of the STACK, Midland, Orion and Delaware royalties, higher prices and increased payments from Weyburn. Cash provided by operating activities was $137.5 million, an increase of 14.8% compared to Q1/2017, reflecting increased net income.\nCorporate Updates\nCobre Panama: Franco-Nevada funded the additional precious metals stream on the Cobre Panama project for $356.0 million on March 16, 2018. Franco-Nevada now has exposure to the precious metals produced from 100% of the ownership of the Cobre Panama project. Delaware Oil & Gas Royalties: Franco-Nevada finalized the purchase of a royalty portfolio in the Delaware, which represents the western portion of the larger Permian Basin in Texas for $101.3 million on February 20, 2018. The royalties are derived principally from mineral title which provides a perpetual interest in royalty lands. The transaction has an effective date of October 1, 2017. Revenue in Q1/2018 included $1.3 million from the Delaware royalties.\nQ1/2018 Portfolio Updates\nPrecious Metals — Latin America: GEOs from Latin American precious metals assets decreased 17.9% year-over-year, with 57,854 precious metal GEOs earned in Q1/2018, reflecting decreased deliveries from Candelaria and Guadalupe-Palmarejo which was partially offset by increases from Antapaccay. • Cobre Panama (gold and silver stream) – During Q1/2018, excluding the funding of $356 million from the additional stream, Franco-Nevada contributed $70.2 million of its share of construction capital for the Cobre Panama project. Franco-Nevada at quarter-end has contributed $796.8 million of its total maximum $1 billion commitment for the construction of Cobre Panama. For the remainder of 2018, Franco-Nevada expects to fund between $160 and $180 million towards the $1 billion deposit. Recently, First Quantum announced plans to expand throughput capacity to 85 million tonnes per annum and potentially accommodate a further increase to 100 million tonnes per annum after 2022. Development activities in some areas were affected for about six weeks by industrial action which has been resolved. First Quantum continues to anticipate phased commissioning during 2018 and continued ramp-up during 2019. NuevaUnión (1.5% royalty) – JV partners Teck and Goldcorp completed a pre-feasibility study at NuevaUnión and now are advancing the project to the feasibility stage which is expected in 2019. The project has 8.9 million ounces of proven and probable gold mineral reserves and 17.9 billion pounds of proven and probable copper mineral reserves (100% basis) to be produced over a 36 year mine life. Franco-Nevada's interest is on the Relincho section of the project. Candelaria (gold and silver stream) – Candelaria delivered 14,075 GEOs, compared to 22,483 GEOs in Q1/2017. Production levels are lower as a result of a pit slide and are expected to recover in 2019. Lundin continues to ramp-up underground production and studies continue to further optimize underground operations including a potential production increase beyond the currently permitted 14,000 tonnes per day. Antapaccay (gold and silver stream) – Antapaccay delivered 21,766 GEOs in Q1/2018, an increase of 44.9% year-over-year, as the mine sequencing moves to a new phase of production with higher grades. Antamina (silver stream) –11,760 GEOs from Antamina were sold during the quarter. This is in-line with expectations and a decrease compared to 13,130 GEOs in Q1/2017. Franco-Nevada has partnered with Compania Miñera Antamina S.A. (\"CMA\"), the Antamina joint venture company, in supporting and expanding CMA's support of Enseña Peru, which aims to improve education at existing schools in the region. Guadalupe-Palmarejo (gold stream) – Guadalupe-Palmarejo delivered 9,906 GEOs in Q1/2018 which is in-line with expectations, compared to 19,300 GEOs in Q1/2017 which represented an unusually strong quarter. Cerro Moro (2% royalty) – Yamana reports that the first ore was fed to the mill on April 25 th and that first doré is expected to be produced in May.\nPrecious Metals — U.S.: GEOs from U.S. precious metals assets decreased by 6.0% year-over-year mainly due to reduced deliveries from South Arturo as Phase 2 mining is complete. 18,364 GEOs were earned from U.S. precious metal assets. Fire Creek/Midas (fixed gold deliveries and royalty) & Hollister (3-5% royalty) – Hecla announced in March 2018 plans to acquire Klondex's three underground operations in Nevada including Fire Creek, Midas and Hollister. Franco-Nevada has agreements and royalties covering all three properties. Stibnite Gold (1.7% royalty) – Barrick announced that it has acquired a 19.9% interest in Midas Gold Corp., the operator of the Stibnite Gold project in Idaho, which is currently in the permitting phase. South Arturo (4-9% royalty) – Joint venture operators Barrick and Premier Gold announced a significant increase to Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources for the South Arturo operation. Phase 2 mining was completed in 2017 and the joint venture now expects to start development of the Phase 1 open pit in mid-2018 and the El Nino underground mine in the second half of 2018. Premier recently released exploration results indicating further high grade reserve potential. Stillwater (5% royalty) – The Blitz project achieved first production in September 2017 and is expected to reach full production by late 2021 or early 2022. Blitz is anticipated to increase total PGM production from Stillwater by more than 50% to approximately 850,000 ounces per year.\nPrecious Metals — Canada : Sales of 12,756 GEOs from Canadian precious metals assets were essentially unchanged year-over-year compared with Q1/2017. Increases from Hemlo and Detour Lake were offset by decreased deliveries from the Sudbury assets. Taylor (1.0% royalty) – Kirkland Lake announced new drill results from surface and underground at Taylor which extend the mineralization at depth to 500 meters below the current mining area and 150 meters below any previous intercept. Dublin Gulch (Eagle) (1.5-2.0% royalty) – Victoria entered into a financing package for C$505 million that will fully fund the development of the Eagle Gold project through commercial production. Victoria estimates first gold pour in the second half of 2019. Kirkland Lake (1.5-5.5% royalty & 20% NPI) – Continued exploration success at Macassa supports potential for future resource growth and resource conversion. Kirkland Lake Gold has previously announced plans for a new shaft at the Macassa mine which would support higher levels of production and offer more effective underground exploration. The two phase project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. Detour (2% royalty) – Detour Gold provided an updated plan to accelerate access to higher grades to smooth the production profile in 2019 and 2020. Preliminary assessment sees production increasing 50,000 ounces per year in 2019 and 2020 but overall production decreasing from an average of 630,000 ounces (2019 – 2023) under the 2017 LOM plan to 606,000 ounces under the preliminary 2018 LOM plan. Detour Gold is in the process of revising its life of mine plan which is expected in June 2018. Red Lake (Phoenix) (2% royalty) – Rubicon announced a new mineral resource estimate for the Phoenix project which included a 113% increase in measured and indicated resources. Musselwhite (5.0% NPI) – The Materials Handling project was 65% complete as at March 31, 2018 according to operator Goldcorp. The project is progressing on schedule and expected to be approximately 10% under budget which should positively impact the NPI contributions. Brucejack (1.2% royalty) – As of March 31, 2018, Brucejack has produced approximately 225,000 ounces of gold since start-up. Franco-Nevada's royalty begins after approximately 500,000 ounces have been produced. Pretium instituted a number of operational improvement initiatives including a grade control program as well as increased underground development to provide additional working stopes.\nPrecious Metals — Rest of World: 24,427 GEOs from Rest of World precious metals assets were earned during the quarter, a decrease of 5.7% year-over-year, due to decreased deliveries from MWS and reduced sales from Sabodala and Karma. Sissingué (0.5% royalty) – Perseus Mining declared commercial production at Sissingué on April 1, 2018 following first gold on January 26, 2018. Subika (2% royalty) – The Ahafo mill expansion was impacted by a tragic accident that resulted in six fatalities. Production has recommenced but civil construction remains suspended. The Ahafo expansion projects (Subika underground and mill expansion) are expected to increase Ahafo's production to 550 - 650,000 ounces per year for the first five full years of production (2020–2024). Franco-Nevada estimates that the majority of underground reserves are covered by its royalty. Sabodala (fixed gold deliveries and stream) – 5,625 GEOs were delivered and sold in Q1/2018 compared with 7,500 GEOs in Q1/2017, which included an extra month of deliveries which were not sold in the previous quarter. Karma (fixed gold deliveries and stream) – 4,453 GEOs were sold in the quarter, a decrease compared to 5,000 GEOs in Q1/2017, which included an extra month of deliveries which were not sold in the previous quarter. Tasiast (2% royalty) – Kinross announced plans to proceed with the Phase Two expansion at Tasiast. Phase Two is expected to increase mill capacity to 30,000 tonnes per day and produce an average of approximately 812,000 gold ounces per year for the first five years. The Phase One expansion remains on schedule for full production in Q2/2018 with Phase Two commercial production expected in Q3/2020. Kinross announced it is assessing the Government of Mauritania's request to enter into mutually beneficial discussions respecting all of Kinross' activities in Mauritania with a view to improving economic benefits to the country.\nOil & Gas: Revenue from Oil & Gas assets increased to $19.0 million in Q1/2018 compared to $10.9 million in Q1/2017, reflecting the addition of the STACK, Midland, Orion and Delaware royalties, higher prices and increased payments from Weyburn. Weyburn (NRI, ORR, WI) – Weyburn generated $10.1 million in the quarter versus $8.3 million in the previous year with continued strong performance under Whitecap, the new operator. Orion (GORR) – Osum Oil Sands Corp. continues with its expansion of the Orion asset to over 18,000 barrels per day. Differentials for heavy oil prices in Western Canada widened during the quarter which negatively impacted revenue. Delaware (various royalty rates) – The Delaware transaction was closed in February 2018. The effective date of the transaction was October 1, 2017 and the royalties generated $1.3 million in revenue for Q1/2018. Rig activity is ahead of original expectations.\nDividend Declaration\nFranco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The dividend is a 4.3% increase from the previous $0.23 per share quarterly dividend and marks the 11 th consecutive annual dividend increase for Franco-Nevada shareholders.

These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. For a reconciliation of these measures to various IFRS measures, please see below or the Company's current MD&A disclosure found on the Company's website, on SEDAR and on EDGAR. Comparative information has been recalculated to conform to current presentation.\nGEOs include our gold, silver, platinum, palladium and other mineral assets. GEOs are estimated on a gross basis for NSR royalties and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into account the NPI economics. Platinum, palladium, silver and other minerals are converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the relevant gold price. The gold price used in the computation of GEOs earned from a particular asset varies depending on the royalty or stream agreement, which may make reference to the market price realized by the operator, or the average for the month, quarter, or year in which the mineral was produced or sold. For Q1/2018, the average commodity prices per ounce were as follows: $1,329 gold (Q1/2017 - $1,219), $16.77 silver (Q1/2017 - $17.42), $978 platinum (Q1/2017 - $981) and $1,035 palladium (Q1/2017 - $767). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which exclude the following from net income and earnings per share (\"EPS\"): income tax expense/recovery; finance expenses; finance income; depletion and depreciation; non-cash costs of sales; impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments; gains/losses on sale of royalty interests; gains/losses on investments; foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses and unusual non-recurring items. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which exclude the following from net income and EPS: foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses; impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments; gains/losses on sale of royalty interests; gains/losses on investments; unusual non-recurring items; and the impact of income taxes on these items.\nReconciliations to IFRS measures:\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31,\n(expressed in millions, except per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\nNet
