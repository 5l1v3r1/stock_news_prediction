The company’s income tax expense in the quarter nearly halved to $181 million from a year earlier.\nDuke, valued at $53 billion, has been expanding its business through acquisitions and investment in renewable energy and power generation stations for electric vehicles.\nNet income attributable to the company fell to $620 million, or 88 cents per share in the quarter ended March 31, from $716 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned $1.28 per share, beating analysts’ estimate of $1.14 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal operating revenue rose 7.1 percent to $6.14 billion.\nReporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:27:03.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
