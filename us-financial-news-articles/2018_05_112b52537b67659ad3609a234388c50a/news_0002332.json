But it’s not clear whether this also holds true in the ICU, where delirium is much more common.\n“Our review suggests these measures are also associated with decreased rates of delirium in ICU,” Nassar said by email.\nIn one respect, however, concerns about liberal visitor policies may be justified, the results suggest.\nOne study in the analysis, for example, found that nurse burnout increased after families were permitted to spend more time visiting ICU patients.\n“The presence of a family member for longer periods may increase healthcare professionals’ workload, families may bring additional demands and frequent questions, and family members can also be very anxious which can compromise nurses and doctors’ work in ICU,” Nassar said.\n“Healthcare professionals’ burnout is associated with lower levels of care for patients,” Nassar added. “These problems can be even worse in lower staffing units such as those in developing countries.”\nVisitor policies should be implemented to ensure that nursing staff can still provide optimal care even when families have more time at the bedside, said Elizabeth Scruth, a clinical practice consultant at Kaiser Foundation Hospitals in Oakland, California, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“The take-home message here is for patients and families to advocate for liberal visiting hours and to always ask the ICU . . . what types of visiting hours are in place,” Scruth said by email.\n“Also, place pictures and other mementos in the room of the patient to make it more home-like,” Scruth said. “The use of ICU diaries can also aid the patient and family to leave messages, provide a daily update of what is going on and how the patient is progressing, and both families, nurses and other medical personnel can write in them.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2FxIYSO Critical Care Medicine, online April 10, 2018.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2FxIYSO"], "published": "2018-05-01T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T00:05:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
