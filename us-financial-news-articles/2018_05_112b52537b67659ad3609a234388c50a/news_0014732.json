I think today was a great match, a lot of long rallies from the beginning until the end,” Daniel said after lifting the trophy.\n“Very happy. I’m obviously pretty surprised that I suddenly won an ATP (title). But I guess things like this happen.”\nDaniel is expected to reach a career-high ranking of 82 after his victory.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T23:51:34.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
