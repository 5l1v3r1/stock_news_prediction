According to Islamic belief, the month of Ramadan commemorates the archangel Gabriel’s visit to the prophet Muhammad, in which he began to reveal the Quran, Islam’s central religious text.\nThe U.S. has a growing Muslim population, estimated to total 3.45 million at the moment, but surveys have shown that many still don’t believe the religion is accepted in the American mainstream.\nAs an article in the Houston Chronicle notes, Muslin community leaders have for years been urging retailers to tap into the expanding Muslim market, which has an estimated purchasing power of up to $200 billion.\nParty City’s decorations provide just one example of this happening. Last year, Mattel (mat) released its first hijab-wearing Barbie doll , and Nike (nke) started selling sporting hijabs .\nThe retailers’ efforts are “a step forward to making Muslims feel welcomed,” American Muslim woman Farah Zubair told the Chronicle .", "external_links": ["http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/15/news/companies/party-city-ramadan/index.html", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Local-Muslims-say-retailers-can-help-bring-12916042.php", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.partycity.com/eid-party-supplies", "https://aicongress.org/programs/gov-relations/engagement/fmp/"], "published": "2018-05-16T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:20:51.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
