And I can only call on all sides to exercise restraint here,” Merkel said during a ceremony awarding Macron the Charlemagne Prize for strengthening EU integration.\nBoth leaders discussed the Iranian rocket attacks and Israel’s response and called for prudence and de-escalation, a German government spokesman said.\nExpectations of a flare-up in the Middle East were stoked by President Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that he was withdrawing the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.\nThe Trump administration portrayed its rejection of that agreement as a response, in part, to Tehran’s interventions in the Middle East, underpinning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s tough line toward Iran.\nMerkel told Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani in a telephone call later on Thursday that she supported maintaining the nuclear accord as long as Tehran upholds its side of the deal.\nMerkel called for talks to be held in a broader format on Iran’s ballistic missile program and its regional activities - including in Syria and Yemen, her office said in a statement.\nShe condemned overnight attacks by Iranian forces on Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights, and called on Iran to contribute to de-escalation in the region. “LET’S FACE IT”\nIn her speech, Merkel urged the European Union to improve its foreign and defense policy, arguing that Europe could no longer fully rely on the United States to protect it.\n“Let’s face it, Europe is still in its infancy with regard to the common foreign policy,” she said. “And it will be existentially necessary to make progress here because the nature of the conflicts has completely changed since the end of the Cold War.”\nPointing to the civil war in Syria, Merkel said that many of the global conflicts today were flaring on the doorstep of Europe.\n“And it is no longer the case that the United States of America will simply protect us. Instead, Europe has to take its destiny into its own hands. That is the task for the future.”\nMacron echoed the call to flesh out Europe’s common foreign and defense policy. “We made the choice to build peace in the Middle East. Other powers ... haven’t kept their word,” Macron said, without naming a country directly.\n“We must succeed in building our own sovereignty, which in this region, will be the guarantor of stability,” he said.
