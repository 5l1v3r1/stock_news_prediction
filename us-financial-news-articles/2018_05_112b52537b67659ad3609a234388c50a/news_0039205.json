Both appeared on Wednesday in front of parliament’s human rights committee, which is investigating the Windrush debacle.\nAlthough legally entitled to remain indefinitely, both were subjected to a bureaucratic nightmare in which they were asked to provide ever more detailed records of their lives stretching back decades, and told that if they failed to prove their legal status they would be deported.\n“I was fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting, but I wasn’t getting nowhere. Immigration wasn’t believing me,” Bryan said, describing the months leading up to his detention, during which he lost his job after being told his boss could be fined for employing an illegal immigrant.\nBryan’s difficulties culminated in five weeks in detention centres for illegal immigrants.\nWilson described similar experiences, and she too ended up in detention for a week. She was then taken to Heathrow Airport and thought she was about to be put on a plane to Jamaica, where she had not set foot since leaving aged 10.\n“I didn’t know anybody over there, so it was like, are they sending me to die? My mind was up and down 24/7 going this way, going that way,” she said.\nAfter interventions from non-governmental groups, lawyers, lawmakers and media coverage, both have since been told that they are in fact legally entitled to remain in Britain indefinitely.\nThe Conservative government has tried to portray the Windrush fiasco as an administrative problem in which people got wrongly caught up in immigration controls that were not aimed at them.\nBut the opposition Labour party and other critics have argued that the affair was a consequence of an anti-immigrant climate which they say dates back to May’s six years as interior minister between 2010 and 2016.
