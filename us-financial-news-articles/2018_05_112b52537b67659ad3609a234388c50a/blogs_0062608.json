The levy will be 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports. The U.S. had given those allies a reprieve from the duties, but the exemptions were set to expire Friday.\nOdland said he's not endorsing Trump's nontraditional way of conducting negotiations.\n\"I'm just simply explaining,\" he said. \"It is effective.\"\n\"We can talk about whether it's the right way or the wrong way or following rules or not,\" Odland said. \"The point though is that what we've been doing hasn't worked. [The administration] is trying something different now.\"\nRegardless, the tariffs drew sharp criticism from around the world and the U.S. allies targeted planned retaliation. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU will introduce countermeasures . Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on steel and aluminum, and Mexico also said it would impose tariffs in response.\nJohn Rutledge , chief investment officer at Safanad, a financial firm, called the administration's actions \"totally irresponsible\" and \"ridiculous.\"\n\"This idea of negotiating by pointing guns at each other's heads and saying, 'I'll pull the trigger,' is really stupid,\" Rutledge, also a CNBC contributor, said Thursday on \"Power Lunch.\" \"It is not the way you conduct a trade negotiation.\"\n\"Trade policy is not done by announcements from presidents and Cabinet members,\" said Rutledge, who was one of the architects of former President Ronald Reagan's economic plan. \"It's done by negotiations between teams, ahead of time.\"\nBut Odland pointed out that there are no agreed-upon rules for negotiating.\n\"Once [the rules] are negotiated, it's called WTO ,\" he said.\n\"We all want the WTO to work,\" Odland said. \"We want our trading partners to be fair. This is an attempt to do it. It's unconventional for sure.\"\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.
