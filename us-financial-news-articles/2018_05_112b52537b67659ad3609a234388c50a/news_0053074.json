REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo Yevgeny Roizman, an opposition politician who was elected mayor in 2013 after beating a Kremlin-backed opponent at the ballot box, tendered his resignation on Tuesday after regional lawmakers voted to scrap direct elections.\nRoizman, 55, who was a rare critic of Putin in a senior regional post in Russia, called the move a betrayal of the interests of Yekaterinburg, 1,500 km (900 miles) east of Moscow, and said he would have no part in it.\nOn Friday, city lawmakers accepted Roizman’s resignation and officially removed direct elections for the mayoralty, Russian news agencies reported. Mayors will now be selected by local officials from a shortlist drawn up by a special commission.\nThe electoral reform was proposed by Yevgeny Kuivashev, governor of the Sverdlovsk region where Yekaterinburg is situated. Kuivashev’s allies argued that doing away with elections would save money and streamline decision-making.\nAs Yekaterinburg mayor, Roizman regularly attended demonstrations organized by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running in a March presidential election in which Putin cruised to a fresh six-year term.\nRoizman was one of a handful of Kremlin critics who won mayoral posts following a series of big opposition demonstrations as Putin campaigned for office in 2012.\nWriting by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T19:48:37.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
