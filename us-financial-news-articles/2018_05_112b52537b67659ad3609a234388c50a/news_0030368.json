Lowe's stock was slightly lower on Tuesday.\nDespite the revenue miss, Home Depot did earn $2.08 per share for the first quarter, 3 cents above what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting.\nCramer, who has said he preferred Home Depot over Lowe's because of what he called generally better earnings results, same-store sales and growth, said investors should believe Home Depot when it says the weather was bad.\n\"I think this company deserves the benefit of the doubt when they say May is a resumption,\" Cramer said. \"Everyone likes to go to Home Depot for the planting season. And the weather wasn't there.\"\n\"There's a stickiness to Home Depot. People come back,\" he added. \"I just don't want people to get hurt\" by bailing on the stock.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
