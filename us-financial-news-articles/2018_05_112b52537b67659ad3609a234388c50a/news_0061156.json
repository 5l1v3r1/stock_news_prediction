The euro fell against the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and U.S. dollar, nearing $1.15 and touching its lowest point since July.\n“It’s not surprising that investors fled fragile emerging markets and southern Europe and sought safety in cash,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments.\n“I have been waiting for a 5 percent correction in Japanese and U.S. stocks for some time. But I probably wouldn’t start buying on a full scale unless the Nikkei drops below the 21,000 level.”\nIn Asia, the focus was also on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and the U.S.-China trade relationship.\nAn aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was traveling to the city to meet the North Koreans.\nThe reports indicate that planning for the summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead.\nThe United States also said on Tuesday that it would continue pursuing actions on trade with China, days after Washington and Beijing announced a tentative solution to their dispute and suggested that tensions had cooled.\nEmerging market stocks lost 1.0 percent, marking a new low point for the year, under continued pressure from a rising U.S. dollar for countries that often borrow in that currency.\nOil struggled under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran, even as U.S. output has surged in recent years.\nU.S. crude futures stood at $66.80 per barrel after falling for five sessions.\nReporting by Tomo Uetake; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:13:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
