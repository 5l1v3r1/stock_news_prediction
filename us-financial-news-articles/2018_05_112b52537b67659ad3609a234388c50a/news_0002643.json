Anthony Devlin/Pool via REUTERS\nThe Conservatives also held on to Westminster, London’s political district, indicating that their losses in the capital would come in at the lower end of the predicted range.\nMay, appearing relaxed and smiling, visited Wandsworth on Friday morning. “Labour thought they could take control, this was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed,” she said.\nRuling parties typically suffer at local elections and surveys had predicted losses in London for the Conservatives after eight years in power. May is negotiating an exit from the EU that 60 percent of the capital rejected at the 2016 Brexit referendum.\nResults elsewhere in London’s 32 boroughs showed only a small swing to Labour, unlikely to give May a serious headache.\nCorbyn has endured fierce criticism over the handling of anti-Semitism within his party. Critics also say he misjudged his response to military action in Syria and a row with Moscow over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in southern England.\nDespite intensive campaigning, Labour saw the Conservatives win back control of the London borough of Barnet, which has the largest Jewish population of any single council area. Slideshow (7 Images) DELIVERING BREXIT\nOutside London, the Conservatives regained control of councils in the pro-Brexit regions of Peterborough and Basildon, largely at the expense of the anti-EU UK Independence Party.\nUKIP has suffered leadership issues and struggled for new purpose since achieving its main aim at the 2016 referendum.\n“The Conservative Party has been reminded tonight that the electorate that it now has is disproportionately a ‘Leave’ electorate,” polling expert John Curtice told the BBC.\n“Therefore, above all, it seems to me that what the Conservative Party has to be able to do in the coming weeks and months is to deliver on Brexit in a way that will satisfy the aspirations of ‘Leave’ voters.”\nMay’s party did lose control of the highly prized council in the Trafford area of the northern city of Manchester - its only foothold in a important economic region, dominated by Labour, where the Conservatives have spent years trying to win support.\nThe results offer the most complete snapshot of public opinion since an election last year in which the Conservatives suffered unexpected losses, leaving May weakened and her party arguing openly about Brexit.\nIn a national parliamentary election, the results would translate to a hung parliament, with Labour holding 283 seats, compared with the Conservatives’ 280, but falling short of an outright majority, according to a BBC projection.\nThe Conservatives also lost control of two south-west London councils - Richmond-upon-Thames and Kingston-upon-Thames - which backed remaining in the European Union in 2016 and were won by the pro-European Lib Dems.\nMay will remain under pressure from rival Conservative factions: those who want to keep close ties with the EU by staying in the customs union, and others who say anything short of a clean break is a betrayal of the Brexit referendum result.
