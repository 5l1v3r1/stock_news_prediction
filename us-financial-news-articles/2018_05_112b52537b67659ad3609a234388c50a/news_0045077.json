China came to the talks ready to step up purchases of U.S. goods, but refused to agree to a specific dollar amount.\nThe talks followed U.S. threats to apply tariffs on as much as $150 billion worth of Chinese imports. The procedural steps to apply tariffs on the first $50 billion tranche of Chinese imports would have been completed next week. Over the weekend, the two sides released a joint statement after concluding the talks. The statement failed to mention any specific numerical target for reduction in the U.S. deficit, as the U.S. had wanted.
