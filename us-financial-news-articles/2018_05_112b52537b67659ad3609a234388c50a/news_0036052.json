Even with strong economic data, strong earnings, the markets are still flat year to date,” said Michael James, managing director of Institutional Equity Trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n“The question remains what multiples are people willing to pay for equities in this higher rate environment.”\nThe retailing index was boosted by a 9 percent surge in Macy’s shares after the department store operator reported strong quarterly results and lifted its full-year profit forecast.\nShares of rivals Kohl’s and Nordstrom were up about 1 percent each.\n“You had pretty solid numbers from Macy’s and it has been an early trigger for outperformance in the retail space today,” James said.\nAt 11:19 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.75 points, or 0.01 percent, at 24,704.66, the S&P 500 was up 4.36 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,715.81 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 24.80 points, or 0.34 percent, at 7,376.43.\nMicron rose 4.3 percent after RBC Capital Markets began coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating.\nThe Philadelphia SE semiconductor index rose 1 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.43-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.60-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 83 new highs and 31 new lows.
