(Nasdaq:MBUU) today announced its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nNet sales increased 82.0% to $140.4 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Unit volume increased 69.4% to 1,786 boats compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net sales per unit increased 7.4% to $78,628 and net sales per unit for Malibu U.S. increased 6.2% to $77,260 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit increased 70.2% to $36.4 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income increased 89.9% to $16.8 million, or $0.76 per share compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 70.1% to $28.5 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted fully distributed net income increased 105.1% to $19.4 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted fully distributed net income per share increased 81.6% to $0.89 on a fully distributed weighted average share count of 21.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\n\"The results of the third quarter were strong. This performance continues to be driven by robust retail demand in the United States along with Malibu’s operating efficiencies. Channel inventories are at or near optimum levels, which is inspiring dealer confidence despite unfavorable weather during the early spring selling season. In addition, our model year 2018 products are performing very well, including our new Cobalt models. On the international front, Canada continues its slow recovery, while Australia, our second largest market, remains a contributor. Lastly, market share gains are accelerating for both Malibu and Cobalt, where we already hold a commanding lead,” commented Jack Springer, Chief Executive Officer of Malibu Boats. “From an operational perspective, the Cobalt integration is going smoothly, and the Cobalt team is immersing itself into our culture. Further, our operational excellence initiatives continue to drive improvement at Malibu and it is having a quicker and better impact with the Cobalt integration than originally anticipated.\nMr. Springer concluded, \"We are executing very well, and as we march towards the end of the fiscal year, macro indicators suggest that the market for our products will stay strong. We remain very well-positioned to generate solid sales growth, improved profitability, and to deliver value to our shareholders.”\nResults of Operations for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nThree Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In thousands, except unit and per unit data) Net sales $ 140,429 $ 77,149 $ 358,343 $ 206,831 Cost of sales 104,066 55,787 271,541 151,833 Gross profit 36,363 21,362 86,802 54,998 Operating expenses: Selling and marketing 3,263 1,789 9,974 6,362 General and administrative 7,862 5,997 22,371 15,514 Amortization 1,291 550 3,903 1,649 Operating income 23,947 13,026 50,554 31,473 Other (expense) income, net: Other income 17 41 27,753 116 Interest expense (923 ) (416 ) (4136 ) (883 ) Other (expense) income, net (906 ) (375 ) 23,617 (767 ) Income before provision for income taxes 23,041 12,651 74,171 30,706 Provision for income taxes 6,245 3,805 56,545 9,897 Net income 16,796 8,846 17,626 20,809 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 1,124 833 2,452 2,115 Net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. $ 15,672 $ 8,013 $ 15,174 $ 18,694 Unit volumes 1,786 1,054 4,584 2,811 Net sales per unit $ 78,628 $ 73,196 $ 78,173 $ 73,579 Comparison of the Third Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 to the Third Quarter Ended March 31, 2017\nNet sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $63.3 million, or 82.0%, to $140.4 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Unit volume for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 732 units, or 69.4%, to 1,786 units as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net sales and unit volumes was driven primarily by our acquisition of Cobalt Boats, LLC (\"Cobalt\") in July 2017. Net sales and unit volumes attributable to Cobalt were $49.9 million and 615 units, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Net sales attributable to our Malibu U.S. segment increased $14.0 million, or 19.6%, to $85.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Unit volumes attributable to our Malibu U.S. segment increased 124 units for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net sales and unit volume for Malibu U.S. was driven primarily by continued strong demand for our new and larger models such as the Malibu Wakesetter 23 LSV and Axis A24. Net sales from our Malibu Australia segment decreased $0.7 million, or 12.1%, to $4.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our overall net sales per unit increased 7.4% to $78,628 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net sales per unit for our Malibu U.S. segment increased 6.2% to $77,260 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, driven by mix of larger premium Malibu models which have a higher average selling price per unit as well as strong demand for optional features and year over year price increases. Net sales per unit for our Cobalt segment was $81,174 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nCost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $48.3 million, or 86.5%, to $104.1 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales was driven primarily by our acquisition of Cobalt in July 2017 and an increase in unit volumes at our Malibu U.S. business.\nGross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $15.0 million, or 70.2%, to $36.4 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit was due mainly to higher unit volumes attributable to our acquisition of Cobalt. Gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 180 basis points from 27.7% to 25.9% over the same period in the prior fiscal year due to the acquisition of Cobalt and an increase in unit volumes at our Malibu U.S. business.\nSelling and marketing expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, increased $1.5 million or 82.4%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of Cobalt. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses were flat over the same period in the prior fiscal year. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $1.9 million, or 31.1%, to $7.9 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, largely due to higher general and administrative expenses attributable to Cobalt, which we acquired in July 2017, and higher development costs associated with our engines vertical integration initiative, and partially offset by lower legal expenses related to previously settled litigation in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses decreased 220 basis points to 5.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Amortization expense for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, increased $0.7 million or 134.7% when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to additional amortization from intangible assets acquired as a result of the Cobalt acquisition.\nOperating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased to $23.9 million from $13.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 89.9% to $16.8 million from $8.8 million and net income margin increased to 12.0% from 11.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 70.1% to $28.5 million from $16.8 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 20.3% from 21.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words and phrases as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “continue” and similar expressions, comparable terminology or the negative thereof, and includes the statement regarding our expected growth and demand for our products, the expected performance of Cobalt and the expected continuing performance of the U.S. market.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results expressed or implied in the , including, but not limited to: the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"); the successful integration of Cobalt into our business; general industry, economic and business conditions; demand for our products; changes in consumer preferences; competition within our industry; our reliance on our network of independent dealers; our ability to manage our manufacturing levels and our large fixed cost base; the successful introduction of our new products; the success of our engines integration strategy and other factors affecting us detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside our control, and there may be other risks and uncertainties which we do not currently anticipate because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on these , which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation (and we expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or supplement any that may become untrue because of subsequent events, whether because of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Comparison of results for current and prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\nUse and Definition of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release includes the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income per Share. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our liquidity. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of these non- GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including certain professional fees, acquisition and integration related expenses, non-cash compensation expense, expenses related to our engine development initiative and adjustments to our tax receivable agreement liability. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin allow investors to evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to assist in highlighting trends in our operating results without regard to our financing methods, capital structures, and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors.\nCertain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets.\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC (the \"LLC\"), and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed net income before income taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc., before non-recurring or non-cash items and the effects of non-controlling interests in the LLC. We use Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash or non-recurring items, and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest as a result of member owner exchanges of LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, because Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is susceptible to varying calculations, the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income measures, as presented in this release, may differ from and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and of our net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is provided under \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nInvestor Contacts\nMalibu Boats, Inc.\nWayne Wilson\nChief Financial Officer (865) 458-5478\nZac Lemons Investor Relations (865) 458-5478\nInvestorRelations@MalibuBoats.com\nMALIBU BOATS, INC.

There was no change in total stockholders’ equity for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The Company evaluated the materiality of the error from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, and concluded that the error was immaterial to the Company’s prior period interim and annual consolidated financial statements under FASB ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. Since the revision was not material to any prior period interim or annual consolidated financial statements, no amendments to previously filed interim or annual periodic reports are required. Consequently, the Company revised the historical consolidated financial information presented herein and will reflect the same revisions in its forthcoming fiscal 2018 Form 10-K.\nMALIBU BOATS, INC.

The reduction in our tax receivable agreement liability resulted from the adoption of the Tax Act, which decreased the estimated tax rate used in computing our future tax obligations and, in turn, decreased the future tax benefit we expect to realize related to increased tax basis from previous sales and exchanges of LLC Units by our pre-IPO owners.\n(9) Reflects the elimination of the non-controlling interest in the LLC as if all LLC members had fully exchanged their LLC Units for shares of Class A Common Stock.\n(10) Reflects income tax expense at an estimated normalized annual effective income tax rate of 23.2% and 35.5% of income before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, assuming the conversion of all LLC Units into shares of Class A Common Stock. The estimated normalized annual effective income tax rate is based on the federal statutory rate plus a blended state rate adjusted for deductions under Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, state taxes attributable to the LLC, and foreign income taxes attributable to our Australian based subsidiary. The decrease in the normalized annual effective income tax rate to 23.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, is primarily the result of the Tax Act which was effective for periods after January 1, 2018, lowering the corporate tax rate to 21%, as well as an updated blended state rate, which considers the impacts of the Cobalt acquisition and a recent law change in Tennessee. The estimated normalized effective income tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 reflects a blended rate of 28.7% of income before income taxes assuming the conversion of all LLC Units into shares of Class A Common Stock. For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the estimated normalized effective income tax rate used was 35.5%.\n(11) Represents the weighted average shares outstanding of LLC Units held by non-controlling interests assuming they were exchanged into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.\n(12) Represents the weighted average unvested restricted stock awards included in outstanding shares during the applicable period that were convertible into Class A Common Stock and granted to members of management.\n(13) Reflects impact of increased share counts assuming the exchange of all weighted average shares outstanding of LLC Units into shares of Class A Common Stock and the conversion of all weighted average unvested restricted stock awards included in outstanding shares granted to members of management.\nSource:Malibu Boats, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0b327609-3f79-49e7-ba12-a13abde8b51a", "http://investors.malibuboats.com/"], "published": "2018-05-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:50:14.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
