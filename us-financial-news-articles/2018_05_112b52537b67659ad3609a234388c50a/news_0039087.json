That’s what we focus the most on,” Danske Bank chief economist Frank Jullum said.\n“This means that growth is in line with Norges Bank’s estimates and that a rate hike will follow after the summer, in line with its previous announcements,” he added.\nDNB Markets also predicted a rate hike.\n“Underlying growth in the economy is good and contributes to higher capacity utilisation, which means that rates can be hiked. We still expect the first hike in September,” DNB economist Kyrre Aamdal said.\nThe government maintained non-oil growth forecasts of 2.5 and 2.6 percent for 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n“This is above the historic trend, and capacity utilisation will increase and remain close to normal levels next year. The labour market has improved faster than projected,” the finance ministry said.\nStatistics Norway meanwhile revised up 2017 mainland growth to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent previously.\nThe crown currency initially strengthened against the euro to 9.5550 shortly after the 0600 GMT release of GDP and budget data, from 9.5802 just ahead of the publication. It later weakened slightly to trade at 9.5750.\n$1 = 8.0258 Norwegian crowns Writing by Terje Solsvik, editing by Gwladys Fouche\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
