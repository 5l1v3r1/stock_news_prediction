REUTERS/Sergei Karphukhin The 55-year-old Senegalese was the first woman to hold a senior role at FIFA when she took over from Jerome Valcke, who was sacked in January 2016 as part of the fall-out from the corruption scandal that rocked the organization.\nSamoura said she had “broken the glass ceiling” in a “male-dominated organisation”, adding “they are used to me now”.\n“There are people who don’t think that a black woman should be leading the administration of FIFA. It’s sometimes as simple as that,” Samoura told the BBC.\n“It is something we are fighting on a daily basis on the pitch - I don’t want any racist person around me.\n“Nobody asks a man when he takes a position if he’s competent to do the job. They just assume that he can do the job.\n“For a woman to make her way up to the top - you need to prove every single day that you are the best fit for that position.”\nWriting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T09:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T09:11:12.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
