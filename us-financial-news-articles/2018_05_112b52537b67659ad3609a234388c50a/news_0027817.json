The best investment anyone can make, he says, is \"paying off your credit cards. Paying off whatever debt you have.\"\nCuban, who struggled to keep himself on the right side of his credit card debt in his 20s, learned the hard way that the money saved on interest by not having debt is better than any return you could get by investing your money, whether in the stock market or in real estate or elsewhere.\n\"Whatever interest rate you have — it might be a student loan with a 7 percent interest rate — if you pay off that loan, you're making 7 percent. That's your immediate return, which is a lot safer than trying to pick a stock or trying to pick real estate, or whatever it may be,\" he says.\nshow chapters A good credit score is key to your financial future — here's how to boost it 11:42 AM ET Fri, 25 Aug 2017 | 01:12 If you have credit card debt, the interest rate may be much higher than that: The typical credit card charges about 15 percent , which can end up costing you a fortune if you continually miss payments or only pay the minimum on your balance each month .\nMany people fall into that trap and, today, the average household with revolving credit card debt pays nearly $1,000 in interest every year .\nThere are two popular ways to tackle debt : the avalanche method and the snowball method. Using the first, you prioritize paying down the debts with the highest interest rates. Using the second, you focus on knocking out the smallest debts to get the momentum going. NerdWallet's debt guide can help you choose the strategy that's best for you.\nOnce you're debt-free, get in the habit of making payments in full so you never have to owe interest again.\nLike this story?
