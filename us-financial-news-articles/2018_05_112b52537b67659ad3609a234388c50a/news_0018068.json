We also had our first discussions with Chinese firms that showed interest,” Vattenfall’s head of strategy Andreas Regnell told Reuters.\n“Based on these discussions, I expect this year that more data centres will come to Sweden, though not of the Facebook magnitude. But mega-data centres will come as well by 2020,” said Regnell.\nSweden plans to decommission two of its remaining eight nuclear reactors by 2020, but big wind projects that will enter the Nordic power system will make up for lost ground and keep prices competitive, Regnell added.\nIn 2017, Sweden cut its tax rate on electricity for data centres by 97 percent, with Norway following suit to compete with its neighbour.\nVattenfall said it would seek to win supply contracts itself, but added regardless who won the deals, new centres would be good news for utilities in Sweden, where margins are tight.\n“We will be happy even if it is not us that will sign the electricity supply contract... total consumption grows and that means prices will go up, which will create profit for us anyway,” he said.\nVattenfall believes other power-intensive industries can benefit from Sweden’s competitive prices, such as carbon fibre makers, but data centres are its prime target.\n“Data centres are the number one, two and three targets for Sweden at the moment. After these comes everything else,” he said.
