But he added that “it was an ordered, efficient sale which achieved a total within its estimated range.”\nIndeed the auction took in $318.3 million, just beating the $307.4 million low pre-sale estimate. Of the 45 lots on offer, 71 percent found buyers.\nOther highlights included Pablo Picasso’s “Le Repos,” which achieved $36.9 million and beat its high estimate of $35 million, and Claude Monet’s “Matinee sur la Seine,” which fetched $20.55 million, at the low end of the $18 million to $25 million estimate.\nGeorgia O’Keefe’s “Lake George with White Birch” soared to $11.3 million, or nearly twice the high estimate, but another Picasso, “Femme au chien” estimated at $12 million to $18 million, failed to sell when no bids exceeded $11 million.\nThe spring auctions continue on Tuesday when Christie’s holds its Impressionist and modern art sale.\nFILE PHOTO: Kevin Ching, CEO of Sotheby's Asia, stands next to Amedeo Modigliani's \"Nu couche\" in Hong Kong, China April 24, 2018.
