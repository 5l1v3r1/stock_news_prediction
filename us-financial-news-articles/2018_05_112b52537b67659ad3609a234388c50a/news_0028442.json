Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Michal Kempny, Alex Ovechkin, Jay Beagle and Lars Eller scored for the Capitals, who played in their first conference finals game in 20 years. The Capitals have won five of their last six games and nine of 11.\nGame 2 is Sunday night before the series shifts to Washington.\n“We can’t use (the layoff between rounds) for an excuse,” said Lightning star Steven Stamkos postgame. “They were quicker. They were more disciplined in their structure. They were better on special teams.”\nTwo of Washington’s four goals came on power plays as the Capitals led 4-0 less than 27 minutes into the game.\nEvgeny Kuznetsov and T.J. Oshie both had two assists, while Ovechkin logged a two-point night by also notching an assist.\nMay 11, 2018; Tampa, FL, USA; Washington Capitals right wing T.J.

I think this whole playoffs we went out there with an attack mentality. It’s paid dividends for us. And it did tonight.”\nKempny opened the scoring just 7:28 into the game for his first goal of the postseason.\nThe Capitals had eight of the game’s first 10 shots on goal.\nOvechkin tallied his ninth goal of the postseason with just over five seconds remaining in the first period.
