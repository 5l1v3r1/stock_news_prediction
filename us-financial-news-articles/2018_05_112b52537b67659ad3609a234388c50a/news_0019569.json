These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Origin’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Origin’s control. Accordingly, you are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Origin believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it was initially made, and Origin does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, unless required by law.\nContact Information\nInvestor Relations\nChris Reigelman\n318-497-3177\nchris@origin.bank\nMedia Contact\nRyan Kilpatrick\n318-232-7472\nrkilpatrick@origin.bank\nSource:Origin Bancorp, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=u1oqgsmVAXjLxZWsiBv1lOvvsGYRWu_ZNLbiKPMhshRWoUXfvl1XxsRqrrj9IsnJ1Ms46WEqCzPlAIFNva0lBg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cqskmDnUcYMbGm0eY097X4aiIDnTRG9CcBz2gSArvtSJAdnsapjAJnZoiOdxwByHP8H7tyFqjFrtrUif0dkdTtfGng4m6gmcZykxgFkr5QM=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cqskmDnUcYMbGm0eY097XxbZ08gii66VDMTLc5mig-Ogvjt-f0BuEpi2D6XlMNfgbGvH8d2RkblDwr5FoPNIPAzsSrDbGgmT5LKNTUS9JKncstHzKKe-VhwQdMrBG1F9"], "published": "2018-05-09T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T02:52:31.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
