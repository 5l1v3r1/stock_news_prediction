None of the four have announced an official date for VAT to be imposed.\nKuwait has the most powerful parliament in the region, so the budget committee’s desire to delay VAT looks likely to stick, although cabinet officials have called for faster tax and spending reforms.\nRevenues from the new tax could be substantial; the International Monetary Fund has estimated VAT in the UAE will eventually rake in 1.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nBut Kuwait’s state finances are among the strongest in the region and oil prices have surged in the last several months, so the Kuwaiti government has little immediate need for fresh revenues.\nGulf governments also agreed jointly to introduce an excise tax on tobacco and sugary drinks, which will raise much less money than VAT. Kuwait’s finance minister said on Monday that he expected parliament to approve the excise tax during its next session, which begins in October.\nReporting by Ghaida Ghantous and Andrew Torchia\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:23:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
