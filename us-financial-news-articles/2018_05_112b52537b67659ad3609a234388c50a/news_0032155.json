Seif is the governor of the Iranian central bank. He's being named a \"specially designated global terrorist.\"\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Seif \"covertly funneled\" money from the Iran's Revolutionary Guards through al-Bilad Islamic Bank in Iraq to help Hezbollah. The Iraqi bank and its chairman is also being punished with sanctions.\nThe U.S. says it's also imposing so-called secondary sanctions on Seif.
