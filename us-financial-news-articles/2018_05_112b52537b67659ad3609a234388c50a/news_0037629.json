Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attends a news conference at their headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\nTrans fats are popular with manufacturers of fried, baked and snack foods because they have a long shelf life, but they are bad for consumers, increasing heart disease risk by 21 percent and deaths by 28 percent, a WHO statement said.\n“Why should our children have such an unsafe ingredient in their foods?,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the statement.\nImplementing the WHO’s strategy for replacing trans fats, including promoting healthier alternatives and legislating against the harmful ingredients, would remove them from the food chain and score a major victory against heart disease, he said.

Some have banned partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of industrially-produced trans fats, the WHO said.\n“Trans-fat is an unnecessary toxic chemical that kills, and there’s no reason people around the world should continue to be exposed,” said Tom Frieden, a former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control who now leads the Resolve health initiative.\nEarlier this month WHO issued its first draft recommendations on trans fats since 2002, saying adults and children should consume a maximum of one percent of their daily calories in the form of trans fats.
