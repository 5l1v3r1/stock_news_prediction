The scheme runs out in September and it will be up to the new government whether to renew it.\n“It makes little sense what the programme says in relation to bad debts, but what’s scary is precisely the little knowledge those words betray,” the head of an Italian bad loan specialist said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe government pact mentions retail borrowers while more than two thirds of Italy’s soured bank loans are corporate.\nShares in Banco BPM, Creval, UBI Banca and BPER Banca all fell 6 percent by 1331 GMT, against a 2.6 percent drop in Italy’s banking sector.\nRising government bond yields increase borrowing costs for lenders and curtail the value of banks’ sovereign holdings.\nItalian banks have reduced their stock of domestic government bonds after the sovereign debt crisis but Creval and Banco Popolare both hold Italian bonds equivalent to more than twice their core capital, according to analysts.\nShares in Monte dei Paschi fell 0.9 percent after an 8.9 percent drop the previous day. The stock is down nearly 40 percent since returning to trade in Milan following a 10-month hiatus.\nFor years the biggest threat to Italy’s financial stability, Monte dei Paschi is slowly trying to recover from years of mismanagement and huge loan losses after an 8 billion euro rescue last year which handed Rome a 68 percent stake and also turned some bondholders into shareholders.\nThe League’s economic spokesman Claudio Borghi on Thursday said the new mission for the bank would entail dropping a plan to close branches, which Monte dei Paschi is pursuing to meet profit targets agreed with EU competition authorities.\nBorghi said a new government would likely replace current Chief Executive Marco Morelli, who last week beat forecasts with a first-quarter net profit of 188 million euros thanks to cost cutting and shrinking loan losses.($1 = 0.8486 euros) (Additional reporting by Francesco Guarascio in Brussels, Danilo Masoni in Milan and Maiya Keidan in London, editing by Louise Heavens and Elaine Hardcastle)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:55:03.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
