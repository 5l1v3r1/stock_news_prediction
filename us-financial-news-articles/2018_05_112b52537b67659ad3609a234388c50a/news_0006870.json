REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) had sought to represent riders in Camden, hoping to secure for them rights such as the minimum wage, an increasingly thorny issue in Britain where more people are working without fixed contracts.\nBritain’s Central Arbitration Committee rejected the move in November and the IWGB had gone to the High Court to seek a judicial review.\nDeliveroo’s Managing Director for the UK and Ireland Dan Warne welcomed the verdict.\n“This decision is a victory for riders who have overwhelmingly told us the flexibility to choose when they work, and where they want, that comes with self employment is their number one reason for riding with Deliveroo,” he said.\nIWGB General Secretary Jason Moyer-Lee told Reuters the union would be renewing its application.\n“We vehemently disagree with the judge’s reasoning,” he said.
