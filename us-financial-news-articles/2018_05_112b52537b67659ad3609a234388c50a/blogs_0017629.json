Oil prices have risen as President Donald Trump indicated the US will likely withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, with a decision due later Tuesday.\nThe oil market has surged on the expectation that President Trump will reimpose sanctions on Iran. No matter what Trump decides, oil bulls and other beneficiaries of higher prices shouldn’t get too confident, Spencer Jakab writes for Heard on the Street.\nCable giant Comcast is getting the pieces in place to make a hostile bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, including its stake in Sky, should it choose to do so, according to people familiar with the situation.\nActivist investor ValueAct Capital Partners has built a roughly $1.2 billion stake in Citigroup, a bet that the giant bank’s strength as a service provider to corporations will enable it to thrive in the post-crisis era and make up ground its shares have lost in recent years.\nIt’s a good time to be a megabank. In many businesses, the largest global banks such as JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America are getting bigger, while others are struggling to keep pace. The latest example: the volatility-induced surge in first-quarter stock-trading revenue that smaller US investment banks almost universally missed out on.\nMiner and commodity trader Glencore has been raking in plenty of cash, thanks largely to healthy commodity prices. Investors are willing to overlook a lot as long as you make them lots of money. When the cash machine slows, or a government decides to confiscate it, they tend to be less forgiving, writes Nathaniel Taplin for Heard on the Street.\nIN THE PAPERS\nThe British cabinet’s divisions over post-Brexit customs policy burst into the open on Monday evening when Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, criticised Theresa May’s preferred policy as a ‘crazy system’ that would leave the UK ‘locked in the tractor beam of Brussels.’ FT (£)\nItaly edged closer to fresh national elections, as the Italian president launched a last-ditch call for parties to support a short-term government in an attempt to break a two-month political deadlock. WSJ\nSnap CFO Drew Vollero is stepping down, leaving the social-media company that has struggled since he helped take it public last year. WSJ\nSome of the biggest names on Wall Street are warming up to bitcoin, a virtual currency that for nearly a decade has been consigned to the unregulated fringes of the financial world. NYT\nCity dealmakers are in line to secure their biggest fees since the financial crisis after billing more than half a billion dollars since the start of January. The Times (£)\nMARKETS TODAY\nEurope’s benchmark stock index was almost unmoved at the open but there were some big swings in individual shares in the early minutes of trading.\nShire was near the top of the Stoxx Europe 600, up 3.4% after Takeda said it would buy the Irish drugmaker. In Japan, Takeda closed 4% higher.\nShares in Air France-KLM gained almost 3% but failed to recover Monday’s 10% plunge, which followed Jean-Marc Janaillac’s resignation as CEO. German postal group Deutsche Post was near the bottom of the index, sinking more than 6% after saying profits had fallen in the first quarter.\nIt was a broadly upbeat session in Asia, with gains in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Oil prices slipped ahead of Trump’s decision on whether to stay in the Iran deal but remained near the multi-year highs achieved in recent days.\nCOMING UP\nPresident Trump is set to announce his decision on the Iran nuclear accord.\nShare this: Previous Warren Buffett’s New Target: Rule That Cut $6.2 Billion From Berkshire Earnings Next Election Caution Hits Malaysian Stocks", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T11:46:30.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
