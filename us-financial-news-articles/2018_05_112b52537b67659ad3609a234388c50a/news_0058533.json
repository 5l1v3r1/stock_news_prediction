Global Atomic requires a board that can act as independent fiduciaries for shareholders. Vote the BLUE proxy to bring accountability to Global Atomic.\nTORONTO, May 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greyling Investments, Inc. (“Greyling”), which owns or controls 7,847,599 shares representing approximately 7.33% of the issued and outstanding shares of Global Atomic Corporation (“Global Atomic” or the “Company”) (TSXV:GLO), has nominated six highly-qualified candidates for election at the upcoming annual and special meeting of shareholders of Global Atomic to be held on June 20, 2018 (the “Meeting”). These individuals are: Basil Carter, Anne Day, Lisa Swartzman, Gary Love, William Wright and Murray Leitch.\nYesterday, Greyling released a letter to fellow shareholders of Global Atomic and filed its proxy circular in connection with the Meeting. In its letter, Greyling expresses its significant concerns about the Company’s poor performance, heavily conflicted board of directors (the “Board”), lack of transparency and the Board’s ineffective management oversight. Greyling also highlights Global Atomic Chairman, President & CEO Stephen Roman’s track-record of destroying shareholder value at Global Atomic and other companies. Greyling is also concerned that Mr. Roman’s attentions are divided, since he is also employed as Chairman, President and CEO of Harte Gold Corporation (TSX:HRT) and receiving compensation from that company as well.\nGreyling believes that the 40% drop 1 in the Company’s share price from the September 29, 2017 meeting of shareholders to May 22, 2018 is indicative of widespread shareholder discontent about the direction of the Company. As such, it had no alternative but to exercise its rights as a shareholder of the Company and nominate six individuals who could bring a much needed infusion of skills, experience and shareholder-focused perspective to the Board.\nGreyling will mail proxy materials to shareholders in connection with the Meeting. Shareholders are encouraged to carefully review those materials. Greyling urges Global Atomic shareholders to discard any materials received from management and vote only on the BLUE Greyling proxy or voting instruction form, FOR all of its nominees.\nThe full text of the letter can be found at:\nhttp://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/9049a84b-6e6b-4660-a6db-8db891c94333\nIf you have any questions, contact Greyling’s proxy solicitor, Evolution Proxy Inc., at 1-833-744-9230 toll-free in North America, or at 416-907-4204 outside of North America (collect calls accepted), or by e-mail at info@evolutionproxy.com .\nA copy of the letter and proxy circular is available on Global Atomic’s company profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nDisclaimers\nGreyling has not sought or obtained consent from any third party to the use herein of previously published information.
