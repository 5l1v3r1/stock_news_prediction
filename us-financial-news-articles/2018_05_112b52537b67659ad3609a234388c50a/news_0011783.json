He cited grounds that the jury had been told that “tangible” could mean “capable of being understood by the mind,” and the appeals court did not adopt that definition. He said he was “confident” that motion would succeed.\nAleynikov, 48, was arrested on federal charges in July 2009 and convicted in December 2010, only to be exonerated by a federal appeals court in February 2012 after serving 11 months of an eight-year prison sentence.\nVance then filed state criminal charges against Aleynikov in August 2012. He was convicted by a jury in May 2015, but the judge who presided over the trial overturned the verdict, finding the copied code was not tangible.\nHowever, the Appellate Division, First Department, a mid-level state appeals court, reinstated the conviction in January 2017, saying a copy on a disk could be tangible. The Court of Appeals agreed to review the case in April 2017.\nAleynikov, a Russian-born U.S. citizen, has said he intended the code only for his own use.
