The technology is also supposed to be able to divert online traffic around around tall buildings and heavy congestion on the Wi-Fi network, making it ideal for urban environments. Terragraph is meant to bring faster Internet speeds and at a lower cost than fiber technology.\nNow Qualcomm’s chips will be integrated with Facebook’s so-called Terragraph technology, allowing manufacturers to build routers capable of sending data at 60GHz speeds.\n“With Terragraph, our goal is to enable people living in urban areas to access high-quality connectivity that can help create new opportunities and strengthen communities,” Yael Maguire, Facebook’s vice president of connectivity, said in a statement.\nFacebook and Qualcomm expect trials of the new Wi-Fi service to begin in mid-2019.", "external_links": ["https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2018/05/21/qualcomm-and-facebook-bring-high-speed-internet-connectivity-over-60ghz", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"], "published": "2018-05-22T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T23:16:38.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
