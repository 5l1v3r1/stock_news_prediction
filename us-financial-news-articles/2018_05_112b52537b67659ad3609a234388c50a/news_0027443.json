Here are the candidates.\nThe government’s decision to renew the mining license for MIDROC’s Lega Dembi mine last month led to two weeks of protests by Guji zone residents who accuse the company of polluting the environment and the Lega Dembi River and allege that the pollution is linked to a range of illnesses.\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment and has not commented on the matter in the past.\nThe mining firm’s owner, Amoudi, was among dozens of Saudi royals and top businessmen detained last year in an anti-corruption drive and is believed to be still held in Saudi Arabia.

Bacha said the final decision will depend on the outcome of the study.
