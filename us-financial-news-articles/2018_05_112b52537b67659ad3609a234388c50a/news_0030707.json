M. Castle & Co. (OTCQB:CTAM) (the \"Company\" or \"Castle\"), a global distributor of specialty metal and supply chain solutions, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The Company also announced today that it has reached an agreement in principle with its first lien lender, PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), to provide for up to an additional $20.5 million of borrowing capacity under its existing first lien credit facility (the ‘Credit Facility’). This contemplated additional borrowing capacity will be made available in part by way of a participation in the Credit Facility by certain of the Company’s shareholders. The agreement to provide this additional borrowing capacity is subject to customary conditions to closing, including execution of acceptable documentation and approval, which the Company expects to complete within the next 30 days.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nRealized quarter-over-quarter volume increase of 13% and year-over-year volume increase of 4%\nIncreased net sales by 18% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year to $145.9 million\nReported net loss of $5.1 million, which included $7.1 million of interest expense, $1.3 million of which was cash interest\nAchieved EBITDA of $3.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 million, including foreign currency gains of $2.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively\nImproved gross material margin to 24.7% compared to 21.8% in the fourth quarter 2017\nPresident and CEO Steve Scheinkman commented, “We are very pleased that the operating performance improvements we implemented last year have translated into significantly improved financial results in only our second full quarter since our emergence from bankruptcy. Our quarterly net sales were higher compared to both the prior quarter and the first quarter of last year, driven by strong volume growth and higher selling prices. Selling prices improved 2.8% compared to the fourth quarter, and 5.1% compared to the first quarter of last year, as a result of both strong demand and the announced imposition of tariffs by the U.S. on imports of steel and aluminum from certain countries.”\nScheinkman further commented, “As our financial performance continues to improve, we appreciate the continued financial backing of our shareholders and PNC evidenced by this transaction. Along with the Company’s improvement in cash-generating capabilities, access to this additional capital will enable us to continue our growth by providing us the opportunity to make additional investments in inventory which will ultimately enhance our ability to serve our customers.”\nExecutive Vice President and CFO Pat Anderson added, “Last year, we implemented an aggressive inventory reduction plan, which has reduced significant amounts of our excess, slow moving inventory burden. It has also significantly increased our inventory turns, and, as a result, we are seeing improvements in gross material margin. In the quarter, our gross material margin increased to 24.7% up from 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect this positive trend to continue throughout 2018.”\nAnderson continued, “We also passed another significant milestone in achieving adjusted EBITDA in excess of our $1.3 million in cash interest for the quarter. In addition to the cash and non-cash portions of our interest expense recognized in the quarter, we adopted accounting guidance which resulted in $1.2 million of interest cost from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans being classified as interest expense rather than a sales, general and administrative expense. The cash interest paid of $1.3 million is significantly lower than our cash interest burden prior to our emergence from bankruptcy.”\nScheinkman concluded, “Although our first quarter results were negatively impacted by increased freight costs stemming from higher fuel prices and additional variable expense from higher shipping volumes, we saw upward trends in demand and a strong pricing environment throughout the first quarter, which have continued into the second quarter. Our gross material margin improved sequentially throughout the first quarter and continued into April. While we saw some customer buying accelerated in the first quarter in anticipation of price increases, we did not experience any slowing of sales in April and we enter May with the strongest order book we have had in quite some time. Due to our established domestic sourcing relationships, we continue to be well-situated as uncertainty builds around the market in response to announced tariffs and potential for quotas on imports.”\nPresentation of Predecessor and Successor Financial Results\nThe Company adopted fresh-start reporting as of August 31, 2017, the date the Company's Amended Prepackaged Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization became effective and the Company emerged from its Chapter 11 cases (the \"Effective Date\").

The non-GAAP financial information should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparative to similarly titled measures of other companies. However, we believe that non-GAAP reporting, giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation contained in this release and in the attached financial statements, provides meaningful information, and therefore we use it to supplement our GAAP reporting and guidance. Management often uses this information to assess and measure the performance of our business. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analysis of operating results, to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliations and to assist with period-over-period comparisons of such operations. The exclusion of the charges indicated herein from the non-GAAP financial measures presented does not indicate an expectation by the Company that similar charges will not be incurred in subsequent periods.\nIn addition, the Company believes that the use and presentation of EBITDA, which is defined by the Company as loss before provision for income taxes plus depreciation and amortization, and interest expense, is widely used by the investment community for evaluation purposes and provides investors, analysts and other interested parties with additional information in analyzing the Company’s operating results. EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP net loss and adjusted EBITDA are presented as the Company believes the information is important to provide investors, analysts and other interested parties additional information about the Company’s financial performance. Management uses EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP net loss and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of the business.\nCautionary Statement on Risks Associated with Forward Looking Statements\nInformation provided and statements contained in this release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
