The altered hemoglobin distorts red blood cells into a sickle, or crescent, shape. Painful episodes can occur when sickled red blood cells, which are stiff and inflexible, get stuck in small blood vessels. These episodes deprive tissues and organs of oxygen-rich blood and can lead to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), acute chest syndrome (ACS), and permanent damage to organs including the liver, spleen, kidney and brain.\nAbout Imara\nImara Inc. , is dedicated to developing novel therapeutics for patients with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies. Imara is currently developing IMR-687, a highly selective, potent small molecule inhibitor of PDE9, to treat patients with sickle cell disease. IMR-687 was specifically designed to treat patients with sickle cell disease by both reducing red blood cell sickling and blockage of blood vessels that are underlying causes of the pathology of sickle cell disease. The company was launched out of orphan drug accelerator Cydan Development with funding from life science investors NEA, Pfizer Venture Investments, Lundbeckfond Ventures, Bay City Capital and Alexandria Venture Investments.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005303/en/\nFor Imara Inc.\nCourtney Heath, 617-872-2462\ncourtney@scientpr.com\nSource: Imara Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005303/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imaratx.com%2F&esheet=51813951&newsitemid=20180530005303&lan=en-US&anchor=Imara+Inc.&index=1&md5=7fd20d56f8cbbaa1d57ac370c91265fc"], "published": "2018-05-30T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:10:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
