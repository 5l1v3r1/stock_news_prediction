Arizona has scored 24 runs in the last 11 games — one run in five games and two in four others.\nAnderson, who struck out three and walked three, is 3-1 with a 2.10 ERA in five career starts against his former team.\nBrewers setup man Jeremy Jeffress made his 21st consecutive scoreless appearance in the eighth inning, and Corey Knebel pitched the ninth for his second save.\nZack Greinke (3-3) pitched six innings, giving up five hits and four runs, with nine strikeouts and no walks. He is 16-4 in Miller Park after spending 2011-12 with the Brewers.\nDavid Peralta singled to open the game and came around on a walk, a hit batsman and another walk, the last to Ketel Marte to force in a run for a 1-0 lead. Anderson left the bases loaded on a strikeout and flyout, the only two Arizona at-bats with runners in scoring position.\nShaw hit his 11th homer of the season with two outs in the first inning, after Cain led off with a fly ball that fell in for a hit when right fielder Chris Owings lost his ball in the ceiling of the dome.\nSantana hit a 3-0 pitch for his third homer with two outs in the fourth inning, giving the Brewers a 3-1 lead. Shaw and Santana homered the last time the teams met, in the Brewers’ 8-2 victory May 16 in Arizona.\nLamb hit his first homer of the season with one out in the sixth inning to make it 3-2. Lamb was playing his seventh game after missing about six weeks with a shoulder injury suffered on the fourth day of the season.\nCain’s sixth homer made it 4-2 in the sixth inning.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:10:54.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
