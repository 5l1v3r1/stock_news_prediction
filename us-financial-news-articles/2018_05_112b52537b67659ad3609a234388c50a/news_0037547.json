The discounting back is affected by whether you choose interests rates like those of Japan or interest rates like those we had in 1982,\" he said in 2017. \"When we had 15 percent short-term rates in 1982, it was silly to pay 20 times earnings for stocks.\"\nMany investors use U.S. government bond yields as their \"risk-free\" discount rate in financial models to value stock investments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:38:44.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
