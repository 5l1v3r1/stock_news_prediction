Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY Sports Per the report, representatives at Curry’s agency, Octagon, are working with the PGA Tour to finalize an agreement and have reached out to prospective sponsors. Both sides have confirmed to ESPN that discussions have taken place, but the deal has been kept quiet as Curry wants to keep the focus on the NBA playoffs, where his Warriors are tied 1-1 with the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference finals.\n“There’s no doubt Stephen Curry brings a young, new, diverse audience to the PGA Tour through his passion for this great game and support for the community,” PGA Tour spokeswoman Laura Neal told ESPN. “We’re excited about the prospect of partnering with an iconic athlete of his caliber in the future.”\nCurry, 30, is a scratch golfer who has been vocal about his love for the sport. He played two rounds in a Web.com Tour event in California last August, finishing 148th in a 152-person field and missing the cut by eight strokes after shooting two rounds of 4-over-par 74.\n“Besides family and basketball, philanthropy, investing, technology and golf are high up on his list,” Frank Zecca, a managing director at Octagon, told ESPN. “Culinary, community and the Bay Area are also priorities.”\nIf the event is finalized, Curry would not plan to play in the tournament, from which the money raised would go to Curry’s charity, the Curry Family Foundation, according to ESPN.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T07:06:03.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
