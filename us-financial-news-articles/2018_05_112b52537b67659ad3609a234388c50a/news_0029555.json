But the tiny felines were actually wild bobcats that were surrendered to a shelter this week, and officials said on Thursday the family was under investigation for possibly violating Texas wildlife laws.\n“Bengal kittens look like house cats. They do not look like wild cats,” San Antonio Animal Care Services (ACS) spokeswoman Lisa Norwood said on Thursday, adding the two species are rarely confused for the other.\nThe family initially told ACS workers that they discovered the cubs abandoned in an alleyway. Later, they confessed that the kittens were found by a relative in a nearby rural county and then brought to San Antonio, according to Norwood.\nIf the family that took in the kittens knew the animals were bobcats, they could face charges for the illegal disturbance of wild animals, authorities said.\nThe search is on for the cubs’ mother because if she cannot be found, the pair may never be able to return to the wild.
