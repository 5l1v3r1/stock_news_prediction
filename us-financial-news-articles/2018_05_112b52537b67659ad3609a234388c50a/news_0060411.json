I hope that I’ll play better tennis tomorrow.”\nHe faces Russia’s Karen Khachanov, ranked 38th in the world, on Friday.\nAsked if playing the Norrie match over two days would disrupt his preparations, Pouille said: “Physically, it doesn’t disrupt much. It’s just ... your nerves, because you have extra tension (on a match day). The stress builds up.”\nRichard Gasquet, seeded 27th, eased past Tunisia’s Malek Jaziri 6-2 3-6 6-3 6-0, dominating with his first serve and leading his opponent into making 40 forced errors, more than double his own count.\nGasquet reached the third round for the eighth straight year. Next up is tournament favourite Rafael Nadal - and harbours few illusions.\n“Unless there is a disaster, he has a good chance of winning,” Gasquet told reporters. “He’s extraordinary. We all know he is.”\nIn the women’s tournament, wildcard Pauline Parmentier downed French compatriot and 32nd seed Alize Cornet in a three-hour marathon 6-7 6-4 6-2.\nParmentier too faces tough odds in the third round against number two seed Caroline Wozniacki, who dropped just one game against big-serving Spanish qualifier Georgina Garcia Perez.
