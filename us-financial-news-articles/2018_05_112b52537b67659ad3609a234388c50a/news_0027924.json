(ABC blamed scheduling issues.) Last Man Standing is coming back for Fox’s 2018-2019 television season.\n“Excited?” Allen said in a Fox statement. “Team [‘Last Man Standing’] was in the sixth inning, ahead by four runs, stands were packed and then for no reason, they call off the game. It leaves you sitting in the dugout, holding a bat and puzzled. Now we get the news from FOX that it’s time to get back out on that diamond — hell yes, I’m excited! When I heard the offer to create more episodes of LAST MAN STANDING, I did a fist pump so hard I threw my back out.”\nAllen was a vocal critic of the Last Man Standing cancellation last year. At the time, he tweeted, “Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years.” Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #lastmanstanding\n— Tim Allen (@ofctimallen) May 16, 2017\nAllen stars in Last Man Standing as Mike Baxter, “a married father of three girls, who tries to maintain his manliness in a world increasingly dominated by women,” according to the Fox statement. The show reportedly drew an average of 8.3 million viewers during its 2016-2017 season.\nThe news of Last Man Standing’s pick-up comes shortly after Fox made the controversial decision to cancel its hit comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine . The show found a new home at NBC the next day .
