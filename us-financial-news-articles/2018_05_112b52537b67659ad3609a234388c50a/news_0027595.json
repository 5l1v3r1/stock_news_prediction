Seven people were critically hurt, including a 16-year-old who was shot in the face, Gaza medics said.\nOf total number 971 needing treatment, 176 were hit by live bullets, they said. Others suffered the effects of teargas or were hit by rubber bullets or shrapnel.\nIsrael has been criticized by human rights groups for its lethal response to the protests.\nA report by the aid charity Save the Children, published on Friday, said that during the protests, at least 250 Gazan children had been hit with live bullets, among nearly 700 children injured overall. The analysis was based on data collected by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.\nAn Israeli army spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the report.\nThe Israeli military said on Friday its troops were defending the border and “firing in accordance with the rules of engagement”.

CONVEYOR BELT\nBefore the protests ended for the day, dozens of demonstrators broke into the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom goods crossing where humanitarian supplies are delivered to Gaza and ignited a pipeline that delivers gas from Israel and torched a goods conveyor belt, causing damage estimated at more than $9 million, Israeli officials said.\nWitnesses said Israeli soldiers used a drone to down flaming kites that protesters flew over the border in a bid to torch bushes and distract snipers.\nThe Gaza Strip, home to 2 million people, is run by the Islamist group Hamas which has fought three wars against Israel in the past decade. Israel and Egypt maintain an economic blockade of the strip, which has the highest unemployment rate in the world and has become far poorer than the other main Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nOn Thursday in Gaza, Hamas leader Yehya Al-Sinwar described the protests as peaceful, and said: “We hope these incidents will pass without a large number of martyrs and wounded, and the occupation forces must restrain themselves.”\nSamir, a refugee whose grandfather originally came from Jaffa, which now lies 40 miles up the coast in Israel, rolled tires toward the area close to the fence where he later burned them.

I want to go back to Jaffa,” he said.\n“Killing me will not change anything, Jaffa will remain Jaffa. They need to kill every last one of us to change the facts.” Additional reporting by Mustafa abu-Ghaneyeh, Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Peter Graff and Alison Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:49:32.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
