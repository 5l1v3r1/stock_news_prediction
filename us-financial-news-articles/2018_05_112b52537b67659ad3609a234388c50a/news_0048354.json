She declined to comment on Gwozdz’s appointment.\nDemler led the INTL FCStone base metals operation until his departure late last year. Both executives joined FCStone from MF Global after FCStone bought its base metals trading team and LME ring dealing seat after the U.S. brokerage went bust in 2011.\nAn LME seat means it can trade in the ring, the exchange’s open-outcry trading.\nGwozdz was at MF Global, or Man Financial as it was previously known for twenty years, his LinkedIn profile shows.\nINTL FCStone did not respond to a request for comment. Gwozdz did not respond to a message via LinkedIn.
