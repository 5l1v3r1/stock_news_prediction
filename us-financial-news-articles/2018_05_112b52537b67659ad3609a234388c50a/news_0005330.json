(NASDAQ: SAMG) (the \"Company\" or \"Silvercrest\") today reported the results of its operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nBusiness Update\nSilvercrest experienced a successful first quarter against a backdrop of more turbulent markets, experiencing net new organic growth during the first quarter of 2018, with $189 million in additional client assets to manage. The first quarter represents the firm's tenth straight quarter of net organic growth, excluding market influence, and marked the 19th quarter of breakeven or better asset flows to the firm. Silvercrest ended the quarter with $21.5 billion in total assets under management, an increase of $200 million over the fourth quarter of 2017. Discretionary assets, however, declined to $15.9 billion, from $16 billion, due to more volatile markets in the first quarter. Our discretionary assets have grown 11% year over year as of quarter end.\nWe continue to invest in Silvercrest's next generation of high-quality talent and have funded new growth initiatives. Silvercrest firmly believes that re-investment in our business and in our clients will create the greatest long-term value for shareholders by continuing our record of growth. We are prepared to use our excess capital to grow the business with new strategic initiatives and intellectual capital, such as our previously announced Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) business.\nOur professionals have real skin in the game with regards to investment performance and our best-in-class value strategies and our successful approach to active management differentiates our firm against an industry backdrop of cheap beta and cookie-cutter asset allocations. We expect our performance to support more opportunity in the institutional marketplace, as well as providing a compelling and competitive offering to high net worth clients and prospects. We are finding new traction with our SMID Cap Value capability which has now been introduced to the marketplace, and we remain enthusiastic about institutional search opportunities. We now have nearly $4.0 billion in institutional client assets committed to the firm.\nWhile the current M&A environment is competitive and expensive, Silvercrest continues to evaluate selective and prudent acquisitions with culturally compatible firms to complement our organic growth, investment capabilities and professional talent, including the potential to expand in new geographies.\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share of Class A common stock. The dividend will be paid on or about June 22, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal Assets Under Management (\"AUM\") of $21.5 billion, inclusive of discretionary AUM of $15.9 billion and non-discretionary AUM of $5.6 billion at March 31, 2018. Revenue of $24.3 million. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") consolidated net income and net income attributable to Silvercrest of $4.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net income per share of $0.27. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") 1 of $6.9 million. Adjusted net income 1 of $4.1 million. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 1, 2 of $0.31 and $0.30, respectively.\nThe table below presents a comparison of certain GAAP and non-GAAP (\"adjusted\") financial measures and AUM.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands except per share amounts or as indicated)\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n24,331\n$\n21,951\nIncome before other income (expense), net\n$\n5,294\n$\n4,747\nNet income\n$\n4,050\n$\n3,300\nNet income attributable to Silvercrest\n$\n2,231\n$\n1,687\nNet income per basic and diluted share\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.21\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$\n6,924\n$\n6,493\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 1\n28.5\n%\n29.6\n%\nAdjusted net income 1\n$\n4,106\n$\n2,997\nAdjusted basic earnings per share 1, 2\n$\n0.31\n$\n0.23\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share 1, 2\n$\n0.30\n$\n0.22\nAssets under management at period end (billions)\n$\n21.5\n$\n19.3\nAverage assets under management (billions) 3\n$\n21.4\n$\n19.0\nDiscretionary assets under management (billions)\n$\n15.9\n$\n14.3\nAUM at $21.5 billion\nSilvercrest's discretionary assets under management increased by $1.6 billion, or 11.2%, to $15.9 billion at March 31, 2018 from $14.3 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase was attributable to market appreciation of $1.0 billion and net client inflows of $0.6 billion. Silvercrest's total AUM increased by $2.2 billion, or 11.4%, to $21.5 billion at March 31, 2018 from $19.3 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase was attributable to market appreciation of $1.6 billion and net client inflows of $0.6 billion.\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. First Quarter 2017\nRevenue increased by $2.4 million, or 10.8%, to $24.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was driven primarily by growth in our management and advisory fees as a result of increased assets under management.\nTotal expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 10.7%, to $19.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $17.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $1.2 million, or 9.4%, to $14.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $13.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the accrual for bonuses of $1.2 million and an increase in salaries expense of $0.1 million primarily as a result of merit-based increases, partially offset by a decrease in severance of $0.1 million. expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 14.6%, to $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in occupancy costs of $0.5 million mainly due to an increase in rent expense associated with the extension of the lease for our office space in New York, an increase in sub-advisory and referral fees of $0.1 million due to an increase in sub-advisory revenue, an increase in portfolio and systems expenses of $0.1 million and an increase in telephone costs of $0.1 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $0.2 million.\nConsolidated net income was $4.1 million or 16.6% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $3.3 million or 15.0% of revenue for the same period in the prior year. Net income attributable to Silvercrest was $2.2 million, or $0.27 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Our Adjusted Net Income 1 was $4.1 million, or $0.31 per adjusted basic share and $0.30 per adjusted diluted share 2 for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $6.9 million or 28.5% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $6.5 million or 29.6% of revenue for the same period in the prior year.\n1\nAdjusted measures are non-GAAP measures and are explained and reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures in Exhibits 2 and 3.\n2\nAdjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are based on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are further based on the addition of unvested deferred equity units, restricted stock units, and performance units to the extent dilutive at the end of the reporting period.\n3\nWe have computed average AUM by averaging AUM at the beginning of the applicable period and AUM at the end of the applicable period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $35.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $53.8 million at December 31, 2017. Silvercrest L.P. had notes payable of $0.8 million at March 31, 2018 and $0.7 million at December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, there was nothing outstanding on our revolving credit facility with City National Bank.\nTotal Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc.'s equity was $50.8 million at March 31, 2018. We had 8,259,056 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 4,942,383 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional insight, promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with GAAP with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share which are non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to the Delaware franchise tax, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings of the Company, taking into account earnings attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring profitability of the Company, taking into account profitability attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders.\nAdjusted Net Income represents recurring net income without giving effect to professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, losses on forgiveness of notes receivable from our principals, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income includes income tax expense assuming a blended corporate rate of 26% for periods beginning on January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and 40% for periods prior to 2018. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring income of the Company, taking into account income attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the actual Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of the end of the reporting period for basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and to the extent dilutive, we add unvested deferred equity units, restricted stock units and performance units to the total shares outstanding to compute diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share. As a result of our structure, which includes a non-controlling interest, we feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings per share of the Company as a whole as opposed to being limited to our Class A common stock.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on May 4, 2018, at 8:30 am (Eastern Time) to discuss these results.
