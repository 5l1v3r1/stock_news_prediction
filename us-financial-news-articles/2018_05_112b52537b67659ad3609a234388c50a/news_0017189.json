Below is a summary of first quarter 2018 results compared to third quarter 2017 results, which was the most recent full quarter under previous leadership.\n3Q'17\n1Q'18\nPercent\nChange\nOil Production (MBbls/d)\n45.1\n45.4\n1%\nLease Operating Expense ($MM)\n42\n39\n-7%\nReported G&A ($MM)\n25\n19\n-24%\nAdjusted G&A ($MM) 1\n20\n17\n-15%\nTotal Operating Expenses ($MM)\n237\n224\n-5%\nAdjusted Cash Operating Costs ($MM) 1\n110\n101\n-8%\nNet (Loss) Income ($MM)\n(72)\n18\nAdjusted EBITDAX ($MM) 1\n159\n189\n+19%\nPermian Completed Well Cost ($MM) 2\n4.67\n4.23\n-9%\n1 See Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for applicable definitions and reconciliations to GAAP terms.\n2 Comparison of wells completed in the Permian with similar proppant loading normalized to 7,500'\nResults Beat Expectations\nFirst quarter 2018 total equivalent production and oil production volumes were above the high end of the company's guidance ranges, while capital expenditures were below the low end of the guidance range. The improvement was a result of better well performance driven by new completion techniques and lower capital and operating costs.\n1Q'18\nActuals\n1Q'18\nGuidance\nDelta to\nmid-pt.\nOil Production (MBbls/d)\n45.4\n43 - 44\n+ 4%\nTotal Production (MBoe/d)\n80.1\n77 - 79\n+ 3%\nOil and Gas Expenditures ($MM) 1\n208\n210 - 220\n- 3%\n1 Does not include acquisition costs\nExecuting Strategy\nEagle Ford enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilot project operational in April - ahead of schedule Drilling first horizontal wells in Altamont Electric frac fleet operating in the Permian Improved well performance from optimized well designs Closed acquisition and divestiture transactions\nImproved Flexibility\nPermian Drilling Joint Venture amended to redirect second tranche to Eagle Ford asset\n\"We are pleased with our first quarter results and increased 1Q completion activity concentrated in the Eagle Ford,\" said Russell Parker, president and chief executive officer of EP Energy Corporation. \"As we continue to focus on capital efficiency and fully loaded returns, we expect to continue to see improvements in the amount of capital deployed versus the amount of ultimate EBITDA generated. Additionally, we are swiftly moving forward with new projects in all three areas to unlock additional net asset value. Throughout the year we will continue to drive these initiatives in order to generate more shareholder value and improve the balance sheet.\"\nEagle Ford: Significant Increase in Oil Production\nThe company produced 35.9 MBoe/d, including 24.0 MBbls/d of oil in the first quarter of 2018, a 17 and 24 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The increase from year-end 2017 was driven by increased activity, improved production results from new well designs and completion techniques, and acquisition properties.\nEP Energy averaged two drilling rigs, invested $135 million and completed (based on wells fracture stimulated or frac'd) 24 gross and net wells in the first quarter of 2018 in its Eagle Ford program. Activities and capital investment were up significantly from the fourth quarter of 2017 where total capital invested was $92 million and 14 wells were completed (frac'd). Approximately 75 percent of the 24 wells completed in the first quarter were in-fill wells and performance, on average, was equal to or in some cases better than, the parent well.\nIn addition to improving well performance, the company is driving down costs through on-site efficiency enhancement. EP Energy has taken over certain well-site operations from third parties. This has resulted in improved efficiencies and an overall savings of more than $100 thousand per well which the company expects to result in approximately $7 million of savings in 2018. This is an example of actions the new leadership team is quickly implementing which contribute to improved returns.\nEP Energy launched its EOR pilot project with the first natural gas injection cycle in April. The project was the culmination of extensive research and study, which was done on an aggressive time frame and demonstrates the company's ability to quickly turn concepts into actionable opportunities. Facilities were in place and first gas was injected within four months of the initial concept review.\nIn April, the company amended its Permian drilling joint venture to direct the development area for the second tranche from the Permian to the Eagle Ford. The drilling joint venture improves the returns on the capital invested. The initial wells in the second tranche are expected to begin producing later this year. EP Energy remains the operator of the drilling joint venture and the material terms and conditions remain consistent with the initial agreement.\nPermian: New Enhancements Increase Efficiencies and Reduce Operating Costs\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company produced 27.0 MBoe/d, including 9.8 MBbls/d of oil, a 16 and 18 percent decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Production volumes were down compared to 2017 due to significantly lower activity levels in the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter, the company averaged one drilling rig, invested $43 million in capital and completed (frac'd) eight gross and net wells.\nDuring the quarter, the company began to use an electric-powered frac fleet, one of only a few operating in the country. The frac fleet utilizes field gas rather than diesel fuel to generate power, which saves costs and time. The company has increased average pumping hours per day by approximately 30 percent in its first three pads compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company began the installation of water handling facilities in the field, which are expected to provide significant operating efficiencies. The enhancements allow more water to be transmitted via pipeline, reducing truck traffic and operating costs. These cost saving initiatives, along with changes in managing drill-outs and flowback operations, are expected to result in more than $10 million of capital savings in 2018.\nThe company maintains ample take-away capacity out of the basin through contractual agreements with third-party processors and marketing companies. In addition, EP Energy has 100 percent of its Midland to Cushing basis exposure hedged in 2018 at -$1.02 per barrel.\nAltamont: Accelerated Recompletions and Progress Towards Horizontal Drilling\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company produced 17.2 MBoe/d, including 11.6 MBbls/d of oil, a four and five percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.\nEP Energy operated two joint venture drilling rigs and completed (frac'd) nine gross wells (three net wells) in its Altamont program. Total capital invested in the Altamont program in the first quarter of 2018 was $30 million. The company also accelerated its high return recompletion program, successfully recompleting 23 wells, an all-time record for the company.\nThe company began drilling its first horizontal wells in April, sooner than planned. The company spud two wells, expects to complete drilling operations in the second quarter and begin flowback in June/July.\nMulti-year Commodity Hedge Program: Well Positioned in 2018 and ~26 Percent Hedged in 2019 1\nEP Energy maintains a solid hedge program, which provides continued commodity price protection. A summary of the company's current open hedge positions is listed below:\n2018\n2019\nTotal Fixed Price Hedges\nOil volumes (MMBbls) 2\n11.3\n4.6\nAverage ceiling price ($/Bbl)\n$\n63.96\n$\n64.45\nAverage floor price ($/Bbl)\n$\n58.45\n$\n55.54\nNatural Gas volumes (TBtu)\n19.3\n7.3\nAverage price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n3.04\n$\n2.97\nNote: Positions are as of May 4, 2018.\n1\nPercentage based on mid-point of 2018 production guidance\n2\n2018 and 2019 positions include WTI three way collars of 6.7 MMBbls and 2.6 MMBbls, respectively, and WTI collars of 0.8 MMBbls in 2018 and 1.3 MMBbls in 2019.\nLiquidity\nThe company ended the quarter with approximately $600 million of available liquidity and $4.2 billion of net debt (total debt of $4.2 billion less cash of $19 million). EP Energy continues to be in active discussions with the banks in the RBL Facility to extend the maturity. The company continues to make progress and expects to complete the process in the second quarter of 2018.\n2018 Outlook On Track With Strong Start\nThe table below summarizes the company's current operational and financial guidance for 2018. Included is the company's estimate for a significant increase in oil production volumes in the second quarter of 2018.

We exclude exploration expense from our measure as it is substantially non-cash in nature and is not related to the costs to operate our existing assets. We exclude the non-cash portion of compensation expense, as we believe such adjustment allows investors to evaluate our costs against others in our industry and this item can vary across companies due to different ownership structures, compensation objectives or the occurrence of transactions.\nBelow is a reconciliation of our GAAP operating expenses to non-GAAP adjusted cash operating costs:\nQuarter ended\nMarch 31,\nQuarter ended\nSeptember 30,\n2018\n2017\nTotal\nPer-Unit (1)\nTotal\nPer-Unit (1)\n($ in millions, except per unit costs)\nOil and natural gas purchases\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\nTransportation costs\n25\n3.43\n29\n3.91\nLease operating expense\n39\n5.48\n42\n5.66\nGeneral and administrative\n19\n2.58\n25\n3.28\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n120\n16.69\n118\n15.92\nImpairment charges\n—\n—\n1\n0.09\nExploration and other expense\n1\n0.18\n6\n0.83\nTaxes, other than income taxes\n20\n2.75\n16\n2.10\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n224\n$\n31.11\n$\n237\n$\n31.79\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n$\n(120)\n$\n(16.69)\n$\n(118)\n$\n(15.92)\nImpairment charges\n—\n—\n(1)\n(0.09)\nExploration expense\n(1)\n(0.18)\n(3)\n(0.40)\nNon-cash portion of compensation expense (2)\n(2)\n(0.27)\n(5)\n(0.65)\nAdjusted cash operating costs and per-unit adjusted cash costs\n$\n101\n$\n13.97\n$\n110\n$\n14.73\nTotal consolidated equivalent volumes (MBoe)\n7,208\n7,456\n(1)\nPer unit costs are based on actual total amounts rather than the rounded totals presented.\n(2)\nAmounts are excluded in the calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense.\nAdjusted general and administrative expenses are defined as general and administrative expenses excluding the non-cash portion of compensation expense which represents compensation expense (net of forfeitures) under our long-term incentive programs adjusted for cash payments under these plans.\nBelow is a reconciliation of our GAAP general and administrative expense to non-GAAP adjusted general and administrative expense:\nActuals\nAs of March 31,\nAs of September 30,\nFY 2018 Estimate\n2018\n2017\nLow\nHigh\nTotal\n($/Boe)\nTotal\n($/Boe)\n($/Boe)\n($/Boe)\n($ in millions, except per Boe costs)\nGAAP general and administrative expense\n$\n19\n$\n2.58\n$\n25\n$\n3.28\n$\n2.90\n$\n3.25\nLess non-cash compensation expense\n2\n0.27\n5\n0.65\n0.60\n0.65\nAdjusted general and administrative expense\n$\n17\n$\n2.31\n$\n20\n$\n2.63\n$\n2.30\n$\n2.60", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:01:09.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
