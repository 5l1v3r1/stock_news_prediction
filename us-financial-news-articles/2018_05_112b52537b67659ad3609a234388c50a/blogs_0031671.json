A distributed ledger could create a trusted — and ideally unbiased — source of information for manufacturers and their customers throughout the supply chain.\n“Because we have audit trails, we don’t have to have the part in front of us to trust that it was built the right way,” Mr. Regenor said.\nLarge firms are experimenting with blockchain to track food through the supply chain. The technology could prove especially helpful during recalls or other food safety scenarios, allowing firms to figure out the source of an offending item during a recall. FedEx Corp. on Monday said it was developing technology that would allow it to monitor shipments beyond its own tracking systems .\nPanelists Tuesday noted that useful blockchain systems will require all parties involved to agree on how data is stored and shared across the network, a governance challenge that will take significant time to complete. They also noted potential security issues, as well as the need to be able to move data among blockchains while preserving immutability.\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: 3-D PRINTING BLOCKCHAIN MANUFACTURING SUPPLY CHAIN Previous The Morning Download: FedEx CIO Says Blockchain Poised to Remake Corporate Logistics Next The Morning Download: Blockchain, 3-D Printing May Converge in Supply Chain", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:57:46.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
