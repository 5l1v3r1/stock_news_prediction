The suspect, also a boy, was detained off campus by officers, who recovered a rifle, according to the department.\nDeputies responded to Highland High School in Palmdale, about 60 miles (97 km) north of Los Angeles, at around 7 a.m. (1400 GMT) after receiving multiple reports of an armed person on campus.\nThe initial reports of a possible school shooting drew immediate attention from major news outlets and cable TV networks. It underscored the national debate over gun control and gun rights that was reignited by the mass shooting of 17 students and staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\nPolice were also called to a nearby elementary school after reports of gunfire but found no evidence of any crime.\nPalmdale, a city of about 160,000 people, boasts that it is the “aerospace capital of the United States.” It is home to a U.S. Air Force aircraft manufacturing plant that includes production facilities operated by Boeing Co, Lockheed Martin Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp.\nReporting by Joseph Ax, Jonathan Allen, Peter Szekely and Bernie Woodall; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:37:13.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
