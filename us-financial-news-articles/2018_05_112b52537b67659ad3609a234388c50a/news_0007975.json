Experts have long warned that the continued destruction of Kenya’s forests will lead to a water crisis that could extend far beyond its borders.\nThe taskforce, which was appointed to study the extent of deforestation in Kenya, said the Kenya Forest Service was largely responsible for the reduction in forest cover due to its opaque processes for licensing loggers and allowing outright illegal logging.\n“The Board and Management of the Kenya Forest Service has been unable to stem and in some instances have directly participated in, abated, and systemized rampant corruption and abuse of office,” the taskforce said in its report published this week.\n“By so doing they have overseen wanton destruction of our forests, have systematically executed plunder and pillaging of our water towers and bear the responsibility for the bringing our environment to the precipice.”\nIt added that despite a 1986 ban on logging indigenous tree species, they were still being cut down.\nThe report also recommended that any illegal squatters be evacuated from the forests and for communities who have traditionally lived there to be resettled in adjacent areas.
