(Nasdaq:VSAR), an endocrine-focused biopharmaceutical company, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We have undertaken additional efforts to aggressively manage our cash as we work diligently to complete our strategic review process,” said Jay Shepard, President and CEO of Versartis, Inc. “We acknowledge the patience our shareholders have shown during this process and we are committed to providing an update as soon as we can.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, Versartis reported a net loss of approximately $9.0 million, or $0.25 per share, basic and diluted, compared to a net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $29.7 million, or $0.85 per share, basic and diluted.\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $8.5 million compared to $29.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $3.6 million, compared to $22.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to the termination of clinical and manufacturing related contracts that supported the company’s Phase 3 clinical trials for somavaratan following the Phase 3 VELOCITY trial failing to meet its primary endpoint.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $7.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
