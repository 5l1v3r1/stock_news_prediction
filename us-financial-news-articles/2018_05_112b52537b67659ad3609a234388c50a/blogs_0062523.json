When booking The Private Suite, passengers literally do not step foot in the airport, even if they're flying commercial airlines like Delta, American or JetBlue.\nSound too good to be true?\nIt will cost you.\nIf you're not a member of The Private Suite ($4,500 annual fee), passengers pay $3,500 per use one-way for up to three people. If you're traveling with two other friends, that's a little less than $1,200 a person.\nFor that premium, when arriving at the airport, travelers are dropped off at The Private Suite's private terminal, avoiding the LAX crowds, lines and security checkpoints, where they then lounge in one of 13 private suites as they wait for their flight.\nThe suites are equipped with sofas, free Wifi, flat-screen TVs, gourmet snack, premium liquors and food, all inclusive of the price.\nThe passengers also have a private team of eight staff who, behind the scenes, check them in for their flight (also handling luggage), then retrieve them when they're ready to board. Travelers never once deals directly with the airline check-in or gate agents. The Private Suite at LAX\nPassengers go through a private, TSA security check-point in the terminal and are picked up in a BMW 7 Series and driven across the tarmac to their plane, boarding before everyone else.\nThese services happen upon landing at LAX too. The Private Suite staff pick the passengers up from the jet bridge, escort down them stairs and into the BMW, drive them across the tarmac directly to The Private Suite, which has a separate entrance from LAX, so you don't get caught in that congested airport pick-up/drop off area. The Private Suite at LAX Private transfer directly to the plane\nMembers who pay the $4,500 annual fee get use of The Private Suite with a preferred rate of $2,700 one-way/domestic, and can have up to three companions for no additional charge.\nIt can be something nice to do for your honeymoon, for example (it can even be listed on a \" honeyfund \"). If you can't or won't pay the $3,500 fee, there are two other ways to access The Private Suite, but they're still not cheap.\nUnited Airlines recently announced a partnership with The Private Suite, and passengers will have access in certain business-class fares. United has negotiated a highly preferential rate for use of the exclusive service. The Private Suite experience will initially be available through select corporate travel booking desks and travel agents, and later available for purchase on united.com or through the United app as part of a premium-cabin ticket fare.
