Net sales increased by 92 percent to SEK 110.1 million (57.3). PAYDAY generated SEK 25.1 million (24.1) and Dead by Daylight accounted for SEK 62.0 million (20.9) of net sales. EBITDA amounted to SEK 48.8 million (-35.3). Depreciation, amortization and impairments totaled SEK 42.6 million (15.5), including an impairment of discontinued publishing projects by SEK 6.3 million. The loss before tax amounted to SEK -6.4 million (-56.3). Basic and diluted earnings per share were SEK -0.02 (-0.18). Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period amounted to SEK 295.2 million (516.9). A directed issue of new shares to Swedish and international investors raised approximately SEK 238 million before transaction costs. The publishing rights to Dead by Daylight were sold for USD 16 million. A new publishing agreement was made for the 10 Crowns game project with an investment of USD 7.7 million.\nAfter the end of the period\nOversubscribed rights issue raised approximately SEK 152 million before transaction costs. Joint venture StarVR Corporation listed on the Taipei Exchange Emerging Market board in Taiwan.\nCEO Bo Andersson Klint remarks on the report:\nNet sales rose by 92 percent compared to last year. At SEK 110 million, this is our best Q1 ever in terms of revenue, even though our major game releases are ahead of us. The publishing title Dead by Daylight and our own PAYDAY 2 are still selling very well and we have improved EBITDA by a full SEK 84 million, from SEK -35 million last year to SEK 49 million this year. The Dead by Daylight deal is driving much of the improvement and we can see that the positive effect will continue until we have received the full consideration of USD 16 million.\nFor more information, please contact:\nAnn Charlotte Svensson,\nHead of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\nTel: +46(0)8-209-208\nemail: ir@starbreeze.com\nStarbreeze AB is required to disclose this information under the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Market Act.
