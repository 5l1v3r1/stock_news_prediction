Google could not be immediately reached for comment. Publishers could in principle move to rival services if they do not like Google’s terms. But Google’s network is unrivaled in size and can often generate more revenue for publishers than competitors’ offering.\nPublishers said that Google’s requirement that publishers obtain consent on behalf of Google and its business partners in the ad-serving sector could enable the search giant to dictate what constitutes consent and which other ad services a publisher can use.\nThey note that GDPR does permit tracking of users without their permission for certain reasons, including serving “a legitimate interest” such as combating account fraud or measuring marketing efforts. Yet Google is insisting on affirmative consent in all cases.\nGDPR violations can carry hefty fines, and publishers wrote that Google’s terms could multiply their exposure to “potentially ruinous” judgements by leaving them liable for misuse by Google and its partners.\nGoogle said on its website Thursday that its “uses of data continue to be controlled” by contracts with publishers and account settings managed by them.\nThe company already requires publishers to obtain “certain consents” from European users and that it is “updating those requirements in line with the GDPR,” Google said.\nGoogle said it is providing optional tools to help publishers meet the requirements.\nJason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, said the statements show that at a time of heightened awareness about online privacy, “these big tech behemoths are focused on protecting their massive collection of personal data rather than aligning with the spirit of these new rules and raising the bar on consumer trust”.\nSmaller players in the digital advertising supply chain say they are concerned that Google could limit working with them if publishers have not obtained consent on their behalf.\n“What’s concerning is when they push publishers to interpret GDPR only the way Google interprets it,” said Joshua Koran, managing director at technology firm Sizmek, which works closely with advertisers.
