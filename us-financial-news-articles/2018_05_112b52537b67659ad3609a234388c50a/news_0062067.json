This will allow Sberbank to increase its stake as part of restructuring process.\nSberbank, with loans worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), is set to become the biggest single shareholder in the new company.\nThe debt settlement must be finalised before the Commercial Court approves it, Perusko said. Two-thirds of the creditors need to adopt the debt settlement agreement by July 10 to avert bankruptcy.\n“A large number of creditors came to a compromise in this process and agreed to write off debt in order to provide for the company survival and future operation,” said Perusko, without elaborating.\nCroatia’s deputy prime minister Martina Dalic resigned on May 14 under pressure from opposition groups who accused her of failing to prevent conflicts of interest during the restructuring of Agrokor.
