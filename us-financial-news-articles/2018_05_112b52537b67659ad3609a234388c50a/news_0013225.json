The two popular dating apps offer some additional bio information like occupation or education on that first facing card, too.\nBut for the most part, users swipe left or right — to indicate interest in matching with the person, or not — based on their photos. Meaningful information like a person's interests or values is found deeper in the profile, if at all.\nOkCupid and Hinge go a little deeper — by listing mutual friends, and guiding users to a more detailed profile with survey questions and conversation icebreakers. show chapters 5:00 PM ET Tue, 1 May 2018 | 01:16\nBut Facebook's innovation in the dating app space — connecting users based on events — is largely new.\nFacebook's dating feature — in many ways separate from the core app — will tie in Events from the larger platform, allowing users to \"unlock\" an event and indicate to other singles on the app that they're interested in attending.\n\"It mirrors the way people actually date, which is usually at events and institutions that they're connected to,\" chief product officer Chris Cox said during the announcement.\nThe app could show you, say, a Friday night beer tasting at the brewery you've been meaning to try — and then present a list of possible matches who said they would also want to go. From there you can start a private chat, make a plan and meet up.\nShares of Match and its parent company IAC both tanked following the news of Facebook's entrance into the space Tuesday. Source: Facebook\nA Bumble spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of Facebook's iteration, but said the company was \"thrilled\" to see the news and has reached out to Facebook around a potential collaboration.\n\"Perhaps Bumble and Facebook can join forces to make the connecting space even more safe and empowering,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\"Facebook could have used swiping in its attempt to enter the dating space, but instead they clearly drew inspiration from Hinge. It validates our anti-swipe, pro-dating movement,\" Hinge said in a statement. \"We're happy to see that our movement to create meaningful connections, not games or hookups, is catching on.\"\nA spokesperson for Match was not immediately available to comment on any potential similarities between Facebook's app and OkCupid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T22:39:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
