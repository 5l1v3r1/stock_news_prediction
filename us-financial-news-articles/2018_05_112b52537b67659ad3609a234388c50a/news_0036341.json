Since Square deals with fiat currency, Dorsey said the company has to approach each market differently, find a unique banking partner, and work with different regulators depending on the country.\nSquare launched cryptocurrency trading through its Cash app in January.\nThe payments processing company said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter. Square spent $33.9 million to buy bitcoin to allow people to trade it through its Cash mobile payments app. As a result, adjusted revenue from bitcoin was just $200,000.\nSquare's mobile payment app is growing faster than PayPal's Venmo and is getting an added boost because it allows transactions in bitcoin, according to Nomura Instinet.\nDorsey has been notoriously bullish on bitcoin's role in the future of payments, and told the Sunday times newspaper in March he expects bitcoin to become the single global currency within the next decade.\nDorsey is a personal investor in bitcoin and said he expects the digital currency to be used for simple things like coffee. The CEO predicted a 10-year timeline \"but it could go faster,\" the U.K.-based paper reported.\nOthers, including Stanley Druckenmiller, have been skeptical about a practical use for bitcoin. He told CNBC in December that he doesn't hold bitcoin and it won't work as currency \"because you can't do transactions, particularly retail transactions, with this kind of volatility.\"\nBitcoin has fallen roughly 40 percent this year, and was trading near $8,260 Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:33:34.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
