The bid valued Eletropaulo at 5.39 billion reais ($1.53 billion), and topped one by Neoenergia SA, controlled by Spain’s Iberdrola SA, of 32.10 reais per share.\nThe government is expected to auction off six Eletrobras distribution companies in the north and northeast of Brazil by June.\nThe auction has been postponed from this month because of an ongoing federal audit court analysis of the bidding rules.
