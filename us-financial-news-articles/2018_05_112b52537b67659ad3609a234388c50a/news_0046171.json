The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a “very high” public health risk to the country since those cases were detected. Over 4,000 vaccines are expected to be deployed to the region early next week.\nThe Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person, who suffers severe bouts of vomiting and diarrhea.\nSo far, the changes in Mbandaka are subtle, but they point to a growing trepidation. At the small regional airport, health inspectors check the temperature of arriving passengers. Local aid agencies have gone to churches and schools to try to educate people of the dangers.\nSoap dispensers have been put outside some local businesses so people can wash their hands before entering. Meat sales at riverside markets have dropped off, traders say, because of the fear of eating contaminated bush meat which can pass Ebola on to humans.\n“We are scared of this epidemic. We can’t make contact with people coming from outside,” said border hygiene inspector Bolongoyi Juptie.\nNot everyone is convinced of the dangers, and one resident said that Ebola can be cured through prayer.\nBut the general wariness is encouraging for health officials who remember how mistrust of doctors, nurses, authorities and western aid agencies made containment more difficult during the 2013-16 epidemic.\n“There is a need to increase awareness,” said Joseph Bolongo, former project manager at the NGO Gashe and local resident, “so that ignorance does not facilitate the spread of the disease.”\nWriting by Edward McAllister Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-20T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:35:36.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
