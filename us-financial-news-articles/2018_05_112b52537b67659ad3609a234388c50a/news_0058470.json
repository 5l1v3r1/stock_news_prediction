BBC had earlier approached Sky Plc ( SKYB.L ) as a potential partner in the joint venture but the talks did not work out, the report added.\nIn November, the Telegraph had reported that BBC’s commercial arm was considering a 500-million-pound bid for full control of UKTV.\nITV is currently in the middle of a strategic review under new Chief Executive Carolyn McCall, who has previously said she would provide investors with an update of the review at the group’s half-year results in July.
