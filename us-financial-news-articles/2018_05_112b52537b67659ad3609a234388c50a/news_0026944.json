A full pardon by the king would mean Anwar can return to active politics.\nBefore the election, Mahathir had said he would step down and give the prime minister’s post to Anwar when he is pardoned. He has said Anwar’s wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail will be the deputy prime minister in his cabinet.

His wife, who visited Anwar in hospital, later told reporters he could be freed in days and pardoned within a week.\n“The Agong (king) wants the pardon to happen as soon as possible,” Wan Azizah said. “If the director of prisons is satisfied ... then he may be released in 2-3 days. Freedom is easier (than getting a pardon).”\nAnwar, 70, was due to be released on June 8 with time taken off his sentence for good behaviour. He began a five-year sentence for sodomy in 2015, a charge he and his supporters say was politically motivated.\nMahathir said he will announced a cabinet on Saturday that would include himself, Wan Azizah and 10 others, including the ministers for finance, foreign affairs, defence and home affairs.\n“Whether Anwar will be part of the cabinet or not will be decided when the time comes,” he said.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha NERVOUS INVESTORS\nMahathir said his government’s initial policies would focus on fulfilling promises made in the alliance’s manifesto, including the abolition of a goods and services tax (GST).\n“In the case of foreign affairs, we want to maintain good relations with all countries regardless of their policies,” he said. “We do not want to favour any country, we want to ensure that the market for Malaysia is as large as possible.”\nMahathir has vowed to reassure financial markets and return billions of dollars lost in a graft scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which was a major factor in the election and in the ouster of Najib, Mahathir’s predecessor and former protege.\nThe new prime minister said the country’s attorney general was wrong to clear Najib in the 1MDB probe in 2016.\n“He, in fact, has hidden evidence of wrongdoing, and that is wrong in law. We have to do what is permitted by the laws of this country,” Mahathir said.\nMalaysian markets were closed and will reopen on Monday, but overseas investors were nervous about Najib’s ouster after a decade in office.

But he was also credited for transforming his Southeast Asian country from a sleepy backwater into a modern industrialised nation.
