It's part of a promotion for the conference, and cryptocurrency exchange BitMex, he said.\n\"We do a lot of this for a lot of companies all the time,\" Nouri said. \"It's an attention grabber. It's for the people walking in. They all say once you make money in crypto, you buy a lambo.\"\n\"I never made money with crypto but I have ten lambos,\" Nouri said. His company rents Lamborghinis out for $1,000 a day.\nBitcoin multiplied 13 times in price last year, minting cryptocurrency millionaires. A Lamborghini can cost about $200,000 or more, and the luxury cars have become an internet symbol for volatile cryptocurrencies' massive potential for wealth creation.\n\"I see a parallel between young people that are really willing to become very rich with the very high-risk investment, and … the fact that our customers are very young,\" Lamborghini CEO Stefano Domenicali told CNBC in a recent interview.\nCase in point, coder Peter Saddington, 35, bought a Lamborghini three years ago for $200,000 with 45 bitcoins. He'd spent less than $115 on the coins when cryptocurrencies were at the very fringes of mainstream interest.\nBitcoin traded near $8,700 early Monday afternoon, less than half their worth in mid-December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:29:08.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
