Underlying net profit, which excludes one-time items, fell nearly 18 percent to S$807 million.\nIt forecast consolidated revenue to grow by low single digits and EBITDA to remain stable for the year ending March 2019.\nSingtel owns stakes in a number of regional telecom operators including India’s Bharti Airtel, whose earnings were hit by intense competition. Another regional associate, Indonesia’s Telkomsel, was hurt by a decline in voice and SMS revenues and slower data growth, Singtel said.\nThe company posted record full-year net profit of S$5.45 billion, including a gain on the divestment of its stake in broadband unit NetLink NBN Trust. Analysts had expected, on average, net income of S$4.87 billion.\n$1 = 1.3398 Singapore dollars Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:34:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
