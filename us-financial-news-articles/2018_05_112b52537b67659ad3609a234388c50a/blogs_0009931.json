According to Earp, this was a \"long-term investment\" to meet the needs of customers.\nThe company — which has operations in Australia , New Zealand and Singapore — has also spent \"many millions\" over the last six months in upgrading the offerings for its Singapore Casket subsidiary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T09:25:09.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
