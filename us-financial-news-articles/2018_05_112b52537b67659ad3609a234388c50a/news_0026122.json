Gulen denies involvement.\nIn similar investigations on Thursday, police detained more than 80 serving air force staff, according to state media.\nTurkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants since the putsch attempt, the U.N. human rights office said in March. Of that number, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during their trials.\nTurkeyâ€™s Western allies have criticised the crackdown.\nCritics of President Tayyip Erdogan accuse him of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.
