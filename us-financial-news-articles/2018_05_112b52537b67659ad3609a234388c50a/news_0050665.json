Varsity Brands and Charlesbank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Partners Group and Jefferies declined to comment.\nFounded in 1920 by Harry J. Herff and Randall H. Jones, Varsity Brands manufactures class rings, yearbooks, caps and gowns, and graduation diplomas. It also makes awards, including the Naismith award given to the year’s top U.S. college basketball players, and championship rings.\nVarsity Brands has been the Heisman Trophy manufacturer since 2002, produced NBA All Star rings, championship rings for all five of the San Antonio Spurs’ NBA Championships, and the Super Bowl XLI championship rings for the Indianapolis Colts.\nHerff Jones, which bought Varsity Brands in 2011, acquired BSN Sports in 2013 for $460 million and later rebranded the entire company under the Varsity Brands banner. Charlesbank and Partners Group acquired Varsity Brands from its employees in 2014 for $1.5 billion.\nReporting by Harry Brumpton in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:50:01.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
