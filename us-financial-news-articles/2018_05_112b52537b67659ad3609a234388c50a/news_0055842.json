Photo: Kayana Szymczak for The Wall Street Journal Sweeping clinical trials in which thousands of patients are studied for years at a stretch have long been the Holy Grail of medical research—especially when funded by the federal government.\nBut in the era of personalized medicine, where care can be tailored to a person’s genetic make-up and doctors analyze a patient’s DNA to figure out treatments , big trials are falling out of favor.\nInstead, many researchers are arguing for smaller, nimbler trials that involve fewer patients and take less time. This has pitted those who believe small trials make more sense against those who worry that large trials are being cast aside in favor of flash-in-the-pan approaches that won’t stand the test of time or efficacy.\nTo Ursula Matulonis, who treats ovarian cancer and other women’s cancers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, the debate over trial size has a special urgency: Many of her patients are desperately sick.\nDana-Farber’s Dr. Ursula Matulonis says some of her patients ‘need medications and they need them now, and they are not looking to wait for five years.’ Photo: Kayana Szymczak for The Wall Street Journal “You can’t wait years to get these medications approved. What we are dealing with are women with cancers and their lifespans are limited. They need medications and they need them now, and they are not looking to wait for five years,” says Dr. Matulonis, chief of gynecologic oncology.\nThat is why flexibility in a trial’s size is crucial, she contends. “As we become more genetically astute, and understand a type of cancer better, I think those large randomized trials will be hard to do. There won’t be that many patients,” that fit into one big group, she added.\nOne of her patients, Janet Sheehan, is grateful for the small clinical trial she has taken part in for the past five years. Ms. Sheehan, a 63-year-old nurse near Boston, was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer a dozen years ago. It has come back three times, and at one point she learned that she had a mutation in the BRCA1 gene which indicates a strong predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. Dana-Farber suggested in 2013 that she go on a randomized 90-person trial for a drug named Olaparib that showed promise among women with a BRCA1 gene mutation.\nJanet Sheehan, a patient of Dr. Ursula Matulonis, seen in Lawrence, Mass., participated in a small clinical trial of a promising drug over the past five years. Photo: Kayana Szymczak for The Wall Street Journal She has been taking capsules twice a day and going for check-ups every 28 days since then. Despite side-effects, she has been able to work and carry on. “I have seen my children [grow] and I have seen grandchildren I didn’t have then,” she says. Ms. Sheehan was on a randomized trial where both groups of patients received treatment with Olaparib. One group got the drug only, the other received Olaparib in combination with another drug, her doctor said, adding, “there was no placebo.”\nIn remission, Ms. Sheehan has become a fan of small trials that offer women such as herself options. She also is a realist. If Olaparib fails, she hopes other trials now going on may yield treatments for her.\nThe big randomized clinical trial is an “endangered species,” says the senior author of a recent study that charted a decline in clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health. “Everyone wants an answer in a hurry. Everyone wants to study a few patients,” says Curtis Meinert, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nDr. Curtis Meinert, of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, calls big randomized clinical trials an ‘endangered species.’ Photo: Allison Shelley for The Wall Street Journal In a study published this year in the journal Clinical Trials, Dr. Meinert and a team of researchers found that the number of NIH-funded trials declined to 930 in 2015 from 1,580 in 2005, a 41% drop.\n“Clinical trials are critical for generating high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice and improve public health,” the study said, adding that the decline in trials could be explained by a “flat NIH budget” that had resulted in “approximately 20% less in real dollars in 2015 than in 2005.” The study said the decline also could be explained partly by rising costs of trials.\nIn a statement, NIH said: “While NIH funding for clinical trials has not decreased, the combination of increasing costs to run clinical trials (e.g. cost per patient enrolled) and reduced buying power has resulted in a fewer number of trials being funded.”\nDr. Meinert, who is 83 years old, has worked on clinical trials since 1960. NIH has “spent more and more money on...small trials, with a sample size of, say, 50 people,” he says, yet only “miracle” cures can be found with trials that small. Industry has stepped in to fund trials but concerns persist over potential bias. NIH data “is very reliable,” Dr. Meinert says. “Hopefully we will come back to our senses.”\nTesting, testing The number of clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health fell 41% from 2005 to 2015 according to a study, in part due to research's rising costs.

With genomics, doctors “are trying to match drugs to individual patients’ features, so the sorts of trials we need will look much different than the large clinical trials,” he added.\nThe debate is surging days before the results of a large clinical trial are to be unveiled this week at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting. In a marriage of modern genomics with a classic randomized trial, researchers followed about 6,700 women breast-cancer patients for several years to see if they could safely be treated without chemotherapy.\nThe trial centers on a genomics test known as Oncotype DX that can indicate how aggressive a woman’s breast cancer will be by assigning it a genetic “score.” In recent years, the test has been widely used by doctors trying to decide whether patients with early-stage breast cancer needed chemotherapy. The recent trial, known as TAILORx, focused on women with more complex breast cancer, to see if they, too, could be spared chemotherapy, a treatment that can be toxic .\nLarry Norton, a breast-cancer specialist and senior vice president at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, points to TAILORx as the “classic example” of why large trials remain important. “No matter the results, they will influence [clinical] practice,” he says. “They will definitely influence what we do.”\nDr. Norton stressed that he believes in small trials—and does some himself—but has been concerned that large trials have increasingly been critiqued as unnecessary. TAILORx disproves that: “The results will affect the care of 100,000 women in the United States,” he said, because the women will—or won’t—receive chemotherapy and that guidance could only have been achieved through a large trial.\nDr. Curtis Meinert, in his office at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md., has worked on clinical trials since 1960. Photo: Allison Shelley for The Wall Street Journal To Dr. Norton, the debate may stem from a divide in “world views” among scientists that could in part be generational. Young people entering medicine have embraced the “zeitgeist” of smaller, faster trials. “It is probably related to the digital age, and the need for immediate gratification,” he says. “You push the button and you get the answer back.”\nAt a recent symposium at the annual meeting of the American Society of Breast Surgeons titled “Why Big Trials Still Matter,” Dr. Norton cast a critical eye on small trials and the current shift toward them. He warned that most discoveries and advances are modest—for example, a drug that reduces the risk of death by 25%—and statistically, they are more likely to be uncovered in the course of large trials and missed in small trials. “I think that we are throwing away a lot of good drugs and a lot of good diagnostics because our trials are too small,” he said.\nAt Genomic Health, the company that produced the test in the TAILORx trial, co-founder Steven Shak, the lead developer of the Oncotype DX test, says it came about after conducting many small trials. Small trials can lead to significant innovations, he said, and are “critical to developing technologies.”\nOf course, he added, the classic big trials are crucial “to determine if these [new innovations] really work.”\nWrite to Lucette Lagnado at lucette.lagnado@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-11912?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12180?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11910?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11915?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11921?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11912?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11915?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12180?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11915?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11915?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11915?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12180?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11921?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12180?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12180?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11912?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11912?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11921?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11910?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11921?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11921?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12180?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11910?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11910?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11915?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11910?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11910?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11921?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11912?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11912?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-05-29T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T23:57:10.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
