Instead, the crowd attending the event was much too large for the space, leading to long lines and in the end a game that wasn’t accessible for most of the day because so many people were trying to play at once.\nThe original event’s attendees were given $100 in Pokécoins and a free Lugia for attending, but that wasn’t enough for some players who had traveled to the event: Those players were eventually awarded $1.5 million in a class action lawsuit against the company, as Forbes reported .\nNiantic promises a 1.8-mile course in the park that will include physical installations as well as exclusive activities. There will also be “a unique and immersive gameplay experience not seen in any of Niantic’s previous live events.”\nTickets to this year’s festival will go on sale May 11 at 9 a.m. PT on the Pokémon Go Fest website . Single-day tickets will cost $20. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T05:12:38.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
