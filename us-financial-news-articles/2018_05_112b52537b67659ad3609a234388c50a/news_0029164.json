In the U.S., one in three dates now begins online. The global market for online dating services—about 500 million people—is expected to reach 672 million by 2019, according to research by Jefferies.\nThe business has been lucrative for the biggest player, InterActiveCorp and its listed subsidiary, Match Group, which owns Tinder, OkCupid and Match.com. That explains why shares of IAC and Match nose-dived 20% and 25%, respectively, when Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would enter the dating scene .\nIAC and Match just offered a strong retort, posting first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. IAC, which owns 22% of Match and brands including ANGI Homeservices and Vimeo, reported revenue of $995 million, topping estimates for $922 million. Match Group, its largest subsidiary, grew 36% year-over-year to $407 million, notching the highest quarterly revenue growth since it went public in November 2015. Tinder, which added 1.6 million subscribers since the same period last year, is now at 3.5 million.\nThe good news boosted their shares—IAC is up nearly 15% from its post-Facebook low. But both remain well below where they were before the social network’s May 1 announcement.\nThe conventional wisdom among investors is that Facebook can do to IAC and Match what it did to Snapchat when it began Instagram Stories. There certainly are risks, but Facebook has a tougher task in the dating business.\nFacebook, like Snapchat, is all about sharing. But not everyone wants to share details of their love life, especially with friends and family on their news feed. (Facebook has promised to keep them separate.) Facebook also needs to win users’ trust—no minor feat given its recent privacy and data scandals .\nThere is already evidence to suggest users don’t like to mix Facebook and dating: Signing up for Tinder was initially only possible through a Facebook account. But two months after Tinder started offering an alternative, non-Facebook sign-up, 75% of new users opted not to sign up through Facebook.\n“Users quickly and decisively separated Facebook from their dating experience,” said Mandy Ginsberg, CEO of Match.\nMany young people are also using Facebook less frequently. And even if they do look for dates on Facebook, that doesn’t mean they will leave Tinder. Most online daters—in search of the best inventory—are active on three dating services anyway, says Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies.\nThe biggest risk for Match may be the erosion of its pricing power. On Tinder, users can swipe for free but they can also pay to “boost” their profile or “super-like” potential mates. Facebook has said its service will be free. After strong rallies in the past couple of years, shares of IAC and Match, while not wildly overvalued, could be vulnerable to a downturn.\nStill, IAC has a huge head-start on Facebook, and it plans to use it. One response could be to consolidate by making further acquisitions.\n“What the market is saying is that scale really matters,” says Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Evercore ISI. IAC’s management team, led by Chairman Barry Diller has the financial flexibility right now to make a new move . “It makes logical and industrial sense to scale up,” says Mr. DiClemente.\nInvestors shouldn’t be so quick to jump ship on IAC. If anything, Facebook’s interest in dating confirms that it’s an industry worth watching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T01:22:14.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
