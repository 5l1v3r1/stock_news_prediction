On the call, Musk told analysts that he had no interest in satisfying the interest of day traders and that he \"couldn't care less.\" Musk added, \"Please sell our stock and don't buy it.\"\n\"You know what that's called? Truth from Musk. Truth,\" Cramer said. \"None of this is, 'I'm kidding.' None of this.\"\nCramer added, \"I think [Musk is] going to have to get out of the call business 'cause it's just too boring for him.\" He later predicted that this may be Musk's last earnings call.\nStill, it appeared Wall Street wasn't swayed by Musk's words and Tesla's stock took a nosedive Thursday, down more than 7 percent at the open on Wall Street. The automaker's first-quarter update has stoked concerns over Tesla's cash burn and how it will improve margins while ramping Model 3 production.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
