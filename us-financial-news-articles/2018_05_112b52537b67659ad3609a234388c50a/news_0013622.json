The two incidents are unrelated.\nThe FAA, which oversees U.S. civil aviation, investigated Southwest in 2017 after employee reports that airline management had discouraged maintenance workers from reporting mechanical issues.\nThe investigation at the time found that some management practices were being used to “influence a relaxing of standards, to look the other way, or to gain a degree of approval through a leniency of standards.” The agency said the additional scrutiny ended at an unspecified date.\nIn response to inquiries regarding the matter on Friday, the FAA said: “The Federal Aviation Administration investigated the whistleblower complaints against Southwest Airlines and found no violations of Federal Aviation Regulations.\n“However, investigators raised concerns that the strained relationship between the company and mechanics might potentially affect safety. As a precaution, the FAA assigned additional inspectors to monitor the company’s maintenance operations. This is standard protocol during contentious labor negotiations and other situations that warrant increased scrutiny.”\nSouthwest and its mechanics had been locked in acrimonious contract negotiations for the last five years. In April, they reached an agreement in principle toward formalizing a five-year deal.\nSouthwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n“The culture of safety in airlines has really deteriorated,” said Bret Oestreich, national director of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. “The airlines are more concerned about the stockholders and the on-time performance over safety.”\nReporting by Alana Wise and David Shepardson; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:06:08.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
