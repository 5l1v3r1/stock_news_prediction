(We) hope to increase understanding through discussion, which is helpful to narrowing differences on certain problems.”\nWhile North Korea and other regional issues would come up and would be discussed with both Japan and South Korea so that the three sides could better coordinate policy, the isolated country was not a focus.\n“I personally think this China-Japan-South Korea meeting is not to mostly discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula. It’s mainly to discuss regional cooperation between the three,” said Kong, who is also China’s special envoy for the North Korean nuclear issue.\n“So I think it will be hard for the three of them to have sufficient time to have deep talks on this issue.”\nIn a later report, Chinese state media said President Xi Jinping had discussed bilateral ties and North Korea in a telephone call with Abe.\nChina and Japan should work together to get relations back on track, Xi told Abe.\nBracketing the summit, Li will make a state visit to Japan from May 8 to 11, when he will meet Emperor Akihito, Japan has said.\nAt Moon’s summit last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, both sides agreed to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Kim is also due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in coming weeks.\nLi will travel to Indonesia before going to Japan.\nIndonesia is seeking ways to speed up a $5 billion high-speed rail project being built by a consortium of local and Chinese state firms which faces obstacles over land ownership issues.
