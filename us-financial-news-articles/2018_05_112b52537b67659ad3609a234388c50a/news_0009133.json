(“Newtek” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:NEWT), an internally managed business development company (\"BDC\"), today announced that on April 27, 2018, its Board of Directors recommended the submission of a proposal for shareholders to approve the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in new Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended by The Small Business Credit Availability Act (“SBCAA”). On that same day, the Board approved application to the Company of the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as modified by the SBCAA.\nAs a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities will change from 200% to 150%, which is equivalent to an increase in the debt-to-equity ratio from 1:1 to 2:1, effective April 27, 2019. However, if Company shareholders approve the proposal by the required majority of votes at the Special Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for July 26, 2018, the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio will be effective on the day after such approval.\nBarry Sloane, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We believe the legislative change will provide a tremendous opportunity for the growth of Newtek’s business model. We want to note that we expect to increase our debt-to-equity ratio gradually over time in a prudent manner, with the goal of improving cash flows and return on equity while minimizing risk. We look forward to discussing the legislation in greater detail on our first quarter 2018 conference call on Thursday morning, May 3, 2018, at 8:30 am ET. The details on how to access our conference call are included below.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Investor Conference Call and Webcast\nA conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results will be hosted by Barry Sloane, President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Eddelson, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.
