Another core inflation measure, also excluding alcohol and tobacco, was 1.1 percent in May, from 0.7 percent in April.\nThe ECB has a mandate to keep inflation below but close to 2 percent, a task that has proven challenging, even with economic growth on its best run in a decade. The ECB has spent months setting up markets for an end to its 2.55 trillion euros ($3 trillion) bond purchase scheme.\nHowever, Italy's political crisis risks reigniting market turbulence on the bloc's periphery and derailing a the bank's exit strategy.\nDaniel Roland | AFP | Getty Images Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) addresses a press conference following the meeting of the ECB's Governing Council in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany, on January 25, 2018. Indeed, ten-year Italian yields surged to a four-year high this week with Spanish, Portuguese and Greek yields also moving higher. The ECB has already amassed 2 trillion euros worth of sovereign debt and will stay in the market at least until the end of September.\nBut policymakers have long argued that the ECB's mandate is to oversee inflation, not help troubled countries, suggesting little appetite now to give up plans to normalise policy.\nECB board members Benoit Coeure and Sabine Lautenschlaeger both made the case in recent days for ending the bond purchases this year and Thursday's inflation data are likely to support their case.\nWhile policymakers tend to look past oil price shocks, some of them privately argue that the inflation rise over the coming months may bolster their case to end the bond buys even if they know the surge is temporary and the actual inflation picture is more benign.\nThe ECB will next meet on June 14 when it publishes fresh projections but a decision on whether to wind down the asset buys is more likely to come at the July 26 meeting.\nWhile investors are near unanimous in expecting the ECB to end bond purchases by December after a short taper, forecasts for the bank's first rate hike have shifted quite sharply in recent weeks, from around next April to possibly as late as September.\nEurostat's first estimate of inflation does not include a month-on-month figure.\nIn a separate release, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone fell to 8.5 percent in April from an upwardly revised 8.6 percent in March.
