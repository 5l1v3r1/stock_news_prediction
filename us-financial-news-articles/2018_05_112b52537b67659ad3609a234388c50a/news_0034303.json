Thousands more protested in cities across the country.\n“It is humiliating for the Romanian people to be led by politicians who are convicted or under investigation 28 years after the fall of communism,” said Nicu Petrescu, a 56-year-old engineer in Bucharest.\nTransparency International ranks Romania among the European Union’s most corrupt states, and Brussels, which keeps the country’s justice system under special monitoring, is especially concerned that the overhaul and the pending changes to the criminal code will reverse graft-fighting progress.\nAnti-corruption prosecutors have sent hundreds of lawmakers, ministers, mayors and other public officials across all parties to trial on corruption charges. The speakers of parliament’s lower house and senate and ruling coalition leaders are both currently on trial in separate cases.\nAttempts by the ruling coalition to decriminalize several corruption offences via emergency decree at the start of last year triggered Romania’s largest street protests in decades.\nLawmakers are also debating a new set of proposals to change the criminal code - including decriminalising some offences and lowering prison sentences.\nOpinion surveys have shown that although the Social Democrats have lost some popularity, they would still rank first in an election with just under 40 percent of votes.
