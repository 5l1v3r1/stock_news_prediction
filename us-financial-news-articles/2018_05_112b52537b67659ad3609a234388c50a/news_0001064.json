AAP/David Moir/via REUTERS\nMacron, followed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, visited Washington last week in the hope of persuading Trump not to reimpose sanctions on Iran before a May 12 deadline and imperil the 2015 deal but the White House has sounded unconvinced.\nUnder the accord, Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions. The deal was struck by Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States and Iran.

AAP/David Moir/via REUTERS\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the agreement on limiting Iran’s development of nuclear weapons was reached under false pretences because the country’s nuclear programme was more advanced than it indicated at the time.\nMacron said he had pushed the idea of a much broader Iran agreement with Trump, which was received “very positively”.\n“I just want to say whatever the decision will be, we will have to prepare such a broader negotiation and a broader deal because I think nobody wants a war in the region, and nobody wants an escalation in terms of tension in the region,” Macron added.

And it’s important with this - precisely this new context not to have any hegemony in the region.”\nMacron, speaking at Australian prime minister’s official residence in Sydney where he thanked Turnbull and his “delicious wife” for their welcome,, also condemned rioting by anarchists at Tuesday’s annual May Day rally in Paris.\nPolice arrested more than 200 people in the French capital after anarchists hijacked the rally by labour unions against Macron’s economic reforms.
