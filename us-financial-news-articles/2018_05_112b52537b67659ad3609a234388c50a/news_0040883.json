Prime Minister Antonio Costa has said he is not opposed to the bid.\n“Portugal receives Chinese investment and investment from other countries as long as they create jobs, create value and maintain assets in Portugal,” said Santos Silva.\n“Chinese investment ... has created value for Portuguese assets and as such this investment is welcome.”\nChinese companies have snapped up a series of Portuguese assets in recent years, in banking, insurance and energy.\nThe two ministers said relations between the two countries were close and there were plans for a visit to Portugal by Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year.\nThey said they hoped to increase cooperation on China’s proposed belt and road initiative, saying Portugal’s southern deepwater port of Sines could play an important role in the maritime route.
