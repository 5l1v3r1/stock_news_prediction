But in the same time, it was a completely different matchup today.\n“There was also the fact that I never beat him. It was 0-6 before today. Some things were a little bit shaky. But I was keeping my level up from yesterday, so that was a great thing.”\nHe will play either Alexander Zverev or Canadian Denis Shapovalov in Sunday’s final.\nReporting by Martyn Herman,; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T21:01:55.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
