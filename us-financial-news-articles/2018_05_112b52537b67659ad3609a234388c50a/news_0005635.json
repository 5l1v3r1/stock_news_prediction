(NASDAQ: IDXX), a global leader in veterinary diagnostics, veterinary practice software and water microbiology testing, reports revenues for of $538 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year period on a reported basis, and 12% on an organic basis. First quarter results were driven by 13% organic gains in Companion Animal Group (\"CAG\") Diagnostics recurring revenue, including strong IDEXX VetLab ® consumables and reference laboratory revenue growth in both the U.S. and international regions, as well as 12% organic growth in the Water business. First quarter results were also supported by 1,403 Catalyst ® placements and 664 SediVue Dx ® placements, an increase of 24% and 72% respectively compared to the prior year period. Total company revenue included $12 million that is attributable to implementation of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (the \"New Revenue Standard\"), with a substantial portion related to the introduction of a very successful multi-modality customer program called IDEXX 360. Earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") was $1.01 for the first quarter, representing 31% growth year-over-year on a reported basis and 32% on a comparable constant currency basis.\nBased on its strong first quarter performance, the Company is raising its full-year 2018 organic revenue growth outlook by 1% to 10.5% - 12.5%, while maintaining guidance for 12% -14% on a reported basis reflecting updated foreign exchange rate assumptions. The Company is increasing its EPS guidance range to $4.06 – $4.20 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint of prior guidance. This incorporates benefits from the higher organic revenue growth outlook and continued constant currency operating margin improvement of an estimated 75 - 125 basis points, as well as incremental tax benefits from share-based compensation activity. These benefits are partially offset by changes in foreign exchange rate assumptions related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As noted in the fourth quarter 2017 earnings release, this outlook incorporates expectations for an incremental $10 million in operating expense investments in innovation and employees, and $5 million of additional capital investment, resulting from the opportunity presented by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. Tax Reform\").\n\"We are pleased with the outstanding execution of our expanded commercial teams around the world in the first quarter, which resulted in 21% growth in premium instrument placements. These results were fueled by our newest innovations, including SediVue Dx and the launch of the IDEXX Catalyst SDMA Test early in the quarter, which further add to the unique value provided by our point-of-care suite of instruments with real-time patient insight,\" said Jonathan Ayers, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"As we continue to advance our commercial presence, innovation and support for our customers, we are building our reputation as a partner in elevating the standard of care, which leads to both healthy practice growth and sustained organic volume gains by IDEXX.\"\nFirst Quarter Performance Highlights\nFirst quarter revenue of $538 million reflected growth of 16% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic basis. EPS for the quarter was $1.01, an increase of 31% compared to the first quarter 2017 on a reported basis, and 32% on a comparable constant currency basis.\nCompanion Animal Group\nCAG generated 17% reported revenue growth and 13% organic revenue growth for the quarter, supported by CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth of 13%, which included $4 million attributable to the New Revenue Standard. CAG Diagnostics instrument revenue growth was 18% reported, 12% organic, including $7 million attributable to the New Revenue Standard, which was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 program in the U.S., providing customers with benefits from multi-modality solutions. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue had another strong quarter, at 12% growth on a reported basis and 10% on an organic basis, supported by 40% growth in diagnostic imaging system placements compared to the prior year period.\nIDEXX VetLab consumables reported revenue grew 21% and organic revenue grew 17%, propelled by an expanding premium instrument base in U.S. and international markets, as well as benefits from innovations like SediVue and IDEXX Catalyst SDMA Test, which combined, added approximately 3% to global consumable growth. IDEXX VetLab premium diagnostic instrument placements grew 21% compared to the prior year period to a first quarter record number of 2,822, including 1,403 Catalyst ® instruments, 755 premium hematology instruments and 664 IDEXX SediVue Dx analyzers.\nReference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services reported revenue grew 18% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis. This growth was supported by continued mid-teen organic reference lab gains in the U.S., reflecting high levels of growth with existing customers and strong new customer acquisition and customer retention rates, as well as strong gains in Europe.\nRapid assay products generated solid reported revenue growth of 9%, 7% organically, driven by strong volume gains in SNAP ® 4Dx ® Plus Tests and first-generation products, supported by seasonal practice stocking programs and continued moderate price gains.\nWater\nReported revenue growth was 16% and organic revenue growth was 12% for the quarter, supported by continued solid volume growth in our core Colilert ® products. First quarter results benefited by approximately 3% from favorable comparisons to prior year channel inventory adjustments in advance of our go-direct initiative in Brazil. Approximately 2% of growth benefit was attributed to later shipping cutoff under the New Revenue Standard.\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy (\"LPD\")\nRevenue increased 10% for the quarter on a reported basis and 2% on an organic basis primarily driven by higher pregnancy product sales and recurring livestock diagnostics revenues, partially offset by continued pressure on our dairy testing business and moderate declines in European disease eradication programs.\nGross Profit and Operating Profit\nGross profit was $303 million for the quarter, an increase of 17% over the prior year period, and gross margin increased to 56.4% from 55.9% in the prior year period. Constant currency gross margin was 50 basis points higher than first quarter 2017, supported by continued solid price gains and volume leverage in our VetLab and reference lab businesses, which offset effects from reinvestment of U.S. Tax Reform benefits.\nOperating profit was $113 million, up 23% on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, driven by high profit growth in our CAG and Water businesses. Operating margins were 21.0% in the quarter, 100 basis points higher than the prior year period on a reported and constant currency basis, reflecting gross margin gains and operating expense leverage driven by our high levels of revenue growth.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nThe Company is maintaining its 2018 revenue outlook of $2,205 million - $2,245 million, reflecting expectations for full-year reported revenue growth of 12% - 14%, and increasing its 2018 full-year organic revenue growth outlook by 1%, to 10.5% -12.5%. Compared to earlier guidance, our updated estimates for 2018 foreign exchange rates reduce our reported revenue outlook by approximately $15 million. We now estimate that the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates in 2017 will benefit 2018 reported revenue growth by approximately 1.5%, EPS growth by approximately 2%, and EPS by an estimated $0.07 per share, including the net impact from projected hedge losses of approximately $5 million in 2018.\nWe are increasing our 2018 EPS outlook to $4.06 - $4.20 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share. This incorporates the operational upside of $0.04 per share from our higher revenue outlook and consistent expectations for 75 to 125 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement, as well as $0.02 of projected incremental benefit from share-based compensation activity, partially offset by a negative $0.04 per share impact from updated foreign exchange assumptions. Our updated full-year estimate of the expected benefit from share-based compensation activity is $12.5 million - $16.5 million, or $0.14 - $0.19 per share. The Company continues to project free cash flow at approximately 80% - 85% of net income in 2018, including an estimated 15% impact related to $50 million of incremental capital spending related to its Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and the relocation and expansion of its German core laboratory, in addition to approximately $5 million in funding of our capital plan to support incremental growth initiatives related to reinvestment of U.S. Tax Reform benefits. For 2018, the Company projects capital spending of approximately $140 million.\nThe guidance for 2018 reflects the assumptions that the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies at the following rates: euro at $1.20, British pound at $1.37, Canadian dollar at $0.77, Australian dollar at $0.74; Japanese yen at ¥111, Chinese renminbi at RMB 6.40 and Brazilian real at R$3.55 to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of 2018.\nThe Company provides the following updated guidance for 2018:\nAmounts in millions except per share data and percentages\nGuidance Range\nGrowth Definition\nYear-over-year\nGrowth\nRevenue\n$2,205 - $2,245\nReported\n12% - 14%\nOrganic Revenue Growth\n10.5% - 12.5%\nEPS\n$4.06 - $4.20\nReported\n38% - 43%\nConstant Currency\nComparable Constant Currency\n36% - 40%\n30% - 35%\nOperating Cash Flow\n~120% - 125% of net income\nFree Cash Flow\n~80% - 85% of net income\nCapital Expenditures\n~$140 million\nWe expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% - 20.5%, after a projected reduction of approximately 300 basis points from share-based compensation-related tax benefits.

These involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these . The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the can be found in the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov .\nStatement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following defines terms and conventions and provides reconciliations regarding certain measures used in this earnings release and/or the accompanying earnings conference call that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), otherwise referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. To supplement the Company's consolidated results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or adjust certain items. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and liquidity and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business and its liquidity and to the performance and liquidity of our peers. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nConstant currency - Constant currency references are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are consistent with how management evaluates our performance and comparisons with prior and future periods. We estimated the net impacts of currency on our revenue, gross profit, operating profit, and EPS results by restating results to the average exchange rates or exchange rate assumptions for the comparative period, which includes adjusting for the estimated impacts of foreign currency hedging transactions and certain impacts on our effective tax rates. These estimated currency changes increased first quarter 2018 revenue growth by 4%, increased gross profit growth by 4%, had an immaterial impact on gross profit margin growth, increased operating profit growth by 5%, increased operating expense by 4%, had an immaterial impact on operating profit margin growth, and increased EPS growth by 5%; are expected to increase projected full-year 2018 revenue growth by approximately 1.5%, increase projected second quarter 2018 revenue growth by approximately 1.5%-2%, increase projected full-year 2018 operating profit margin growth by approximately 10 basis points, and increase projected full-year 2018 EPS growth by approximately 2%. Constant currency revenue growth represents the percentage change in revenue during the applicable period, as compared to the prior year period, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See the supplementary analysis of results below for revenue percentage change from currency for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nGrowth and organic revenue growth - All references to growth and organic growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless specifically noted. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and revenue from business acquisitions. See the supplementary analysis of results below for a reconciliation of reported revenue growth to organic revenue growth for the three months ended March 31, 2018. See the constant currency note above for the impacts of estimated currency changes to the projected full-year and second quarter 2018 organic revenue growth for the Company. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to business acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2018, we exclude only acquisitions that are considered to be a business (consistent with ASU 2017-01, \"Business Combinations: (Topic 850) Clarifying the Definition of a Business\") from organic revenue growth. For more detail on what acquisitions we consider to be a business in computing organic growth, please see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations, Non-GAAP Financial Measures, contained in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the calculation of projected full-year and second quarter 2018 organic revenue growth, the impacts of revenue from acquisitions is immaterial.\nComparable constant currency EPS growth - Comparable constant currency EPS growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the tax effects of share-based compensation activity under ASU 2016-09, a one-time negative impact related to U.S. Tax Reform, and a discrete tax benefit related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. Management believes comparable constant currency EPS growth is a more useful way to measure the Company's business performance than constant currency EPS growth, and will be used going forward, because it enables better period-over-period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding a key metric used by management. Share-based compensation activity increased first quarter 2018 EPS by $0.11 compared to $0.12 in the first quarter of 2017, and is expected to increase projected EPS by $0.16 for the full-year 2018 compared to $0.30 for full-year 2017. A one-time negative impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for the fourth quarter of 2017, due to the deemed repatriation of the Company's foreign profits, net of the remeasurement of deferred taxes at the lower enacted corporate tax rate, reduced full-year 2017 EPS by $0.34. A discrete tax benefit related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits in 2017 increased full-year 2017 EPS by $0.04. These impacts and those described in the constant currency note above reconcile reported EPS growth to comparable constant currency EPS growth for the Company.\nFree cash flow - Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and means, with respect to a measurement period, the cash generated from operations during that period reduced by the Company's investments in property and equipment. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure because it indicates the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in property and equipment that are required to operate the business. See the supplementary analysis of results below for our calculation of free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. To estimate projected 2018 free cash flow, we have deducted projected purchases of property and equipment (also referred to as capital expenditures) of approximately $140 million.\nDebt to Adjusted EBITDA (Leverage Ratios) - Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, and net debt are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation based on reported results. Management believes that using Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt and net debt in the Adjusted EBITDA ratio is a useful and recognized measure for evaluating financial leverage. For further information on how Adjusted EBITDA and the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are calculated, see the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Operations\nAmounts in thousands except per share data (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue:\nRevenue\n$537,656\n$462,021\nExpenses and Income:\nCost of revenue\n234,557\n203,830\nGross profit\n303,099\n258,191\nSales and marketing\n100,101\n87,244\nGeneral and administrative\n60,931\n52,914\nResearch and development\n29,023\n25,790\nIncome from operations\n113,044\n92,243\nInterest expense, net\n(8,695)\n(7,506)\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n104,349\n84,737\nProvision for income taxes\n14,873\n15,679\nNet Income:\nNet income\n89,476\n69,058\nLess: Noncontrolling interest in subsidiary's earnings\n25\n39\nNet income attributable to stockholders\n$89,451\n$69,019\nEarnings per share: Basic\n$1.02\n$0.78\nEarnings per share: Diluted\n$1.01\n$0.77\nShares outstanding: Basic\n87,331\n88,117\nShares outstanding: Diluted\n88,944\n89,994\nIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSelected Operating Information (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nOperating Ratios\nGross profit\n56.4%\n55.9%\n(as a percentage of revenue):\nSales, marketing, general and administrative expense\n30.0%\n30.3%\nResearch and development expense\n5.4%\n5.6%\nIncome from operations 1\n21.0%\n20.0%\n1 Amounts presented may not recalculate due to rounding.\nIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSegment Information\nAmounts in thousands (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nPercent of\nMarch 31,\nPercent of\n2018\nRevenue\n2017\nRevenue\nRevenue:\nCAG\n$470,833\n$403,227\nWater\n29,143\n25,077\nLPD\n32,240\n29,317\nOther\n5,440\n4,400\nTotal\n$537,656\n$462,021\nGross Profit:\nCAG\n$261,933\n55.6%\n$221,070\n54.8%\nWater\n20,362\n69.9%\n17,475\n69.7%\nLPD\n17,647\n54.7%\n16,845\n57.5%\nOther\n2,074\n38.1%\n2,111\n48.0%\nUnallocated Amounts\n1,083\nN/A\n690\nN/A\nTotal\n$303,099\n56.4%\n$258,191\n55.9%\nIncome from Operations:\nCAG\n$100,398\n21.3%\n$79,855\n19.8%\nWater\n12,462\n42.8%\n10,263\n40.9%\nLPD\n2,961\n9.2%\n3,802\n13.0%\nOther\n498\n9.2%\n393\n8.9%\nUnallocated Amounts\n(3,275)\nN/A\n(2,070)\nN/A\nTotal\n$113,044\n21.0%\n$92,243\n20.0%\nIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nRevenues and Revenue Growth Analysis by Product and Service Categories and by Domestic and International Markets\nAmounts in thousands (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nPercentage\nPercentage\nOrganic\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nDollar\nPercentage\nChange from\nChange from\nRevenue\nNet Revenue\n2018\n2017\nChange\nChange\nCurrency\nAcquisitions\nGrowth 1\nCAG\n$470,833\n$403,227\n$67,606\n16.8%\n3.6%\n0.1%\n13.1%\nUnited States\n308,286\n270,488\n37,798\n14.0%\n-\n0.1%\n13.9%\nInternational\n162,547\n132,739\n29,808\n22.5%\n10.9%\n-\n11.5%\nWater\n29,143\n25,077\n4,066\n16.2%\n4.4%\n-\n11.8%\nUnited States\n13,921\n13,019\n902\n6.9%\n-\n-\n6.9%\nInternational\n15,222\n12,058\n3,164\n26.2%\n9.5%\n-\n16.8%\nLPD\n32,240\n29,317\n2,923\n10.0%\n8.0%\n-\n2.0%\nUnited States\n3,313\n3,484\n(171)\n(4.9%)\n-\n-\n(4.9%)\nInternational\n28,927\n25,833\n3,094\n12.0%\n9.2%\n-\n2.8%\nOther\n5,440\n4,400\n1,040\n23.6%\n1.3%\n-\n22.3%\nTotal Company\n$537,656\n$462,021\n$75,635\n16.4%\n4.0%\n0.1%\n12.3%\nUnited States\n327,461\n288,613\n38,848\n13.5%\n-\n0.1%\n13.4%\nInternational\n210,195\n173,408\n36,787\n21.2%\n10.4%\n-\n10.8%\nThree Months Ended\nPercentage\nPercentage\nOrganic\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nDollar\nPercentage\nChange from\nChange from\nRevenue\nNet CAG Revenue\n2018\n2017\nChange\nChange\nCurrency\nAcquisitions\nGrowth 1\nCAG Diagnostics recurring revenue:\n$406,048\n$346,680\n$59,368\n17.1%\n3.7%\n-\n13.4%\nIDEXX VetLab consumables\n149,513\n123,553\n25,960\n21.0%\n4.3%\n-\n16.7%\nRapid assay products\n52,017\n47,895\n4,122\n8.6%\n1.9%\n-\n6.7%\nReference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services\n186,937\n159,069\n27,868\n17.5%\n3.8%\n-\n13.7%\nCAG Diagnostics services and accessories\n17,581\n16,163\n1,418\n8.8%\n4.1%\n-\n4.6%\nCAG Diagnostics capital – instruments\n30,895\n26,183\n4,712\n18.0%\n6.1%\n-\n11.9%\nVeterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems\n33,890\n30,364\n3,526\n11.6%\n0.7%\n1.0%\n9.9%\nNet CAG revenue\n$470,833\n$403,227\n$67,606\n16.8%\n3.6%\n0.1%\n13.1%\n1 See Statements Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures, above.
