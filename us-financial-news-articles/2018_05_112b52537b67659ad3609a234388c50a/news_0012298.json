Demand from domestic customers rose by 3 percent in real terms and foreign orders fell by 7 percent, VDMA said. Euro zone order were 2 percent lower and demand from countries outside the single-currency bloc slumped by 8 percent. In the less volatile January-March comparison, orders were up 7 percent on the year, VDMA said. Domestic demand surged 9 percent and foreign orders edged 6 percent higher. \"Despite the decline the results for March are entirely respectable,\" said VDMA economist Olaf Wortmann.
