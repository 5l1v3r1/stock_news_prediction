What is this? It’s a terrible compromise for the League,” Veneranda Lorenti, a League supporter, said.\nMore than 90 percent of almost 45,000 members of 5-Star voted in favour of the programme on Friday.\nBut the plans for the financial sector rattled investors as industry leaders said they could stall a clean-up of bank bad debt and derail a tentative recovery.\n“I agree with the idea of an anti-establishment government, they should press ahead with stronger policies in the interest of Italy and (against) the European bureaucracies and the financial oligarchies,” Massimo Wailbacher said as he queued up to vote at one of the stands in Milan.\nSalvini and 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the weekend would be decisive to finalise talks over a candidate for prime minister and to outline the ministers of a future government.\nBoth have agreed that neither of them would run as candidate for prime minister. Salvini said the person would be “a professional with indisputable experience”, who had helped draw up the programme.\n“The premier will be more shifted towards the 5-Star, but not their representative,” deputy secretary of the League Lorenzo Fontana said, explaining this was due to the fact that the Movement had won more votes than the League at elections.\nThe two party leaders are due on Monday to meet President Sergio Mattarella, who must approve the programme and has a final say on their nomination for prime minister.
