REUTERS/ Stephen Lam\nThe announcement comes on the day when Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ) said it would invest $2.25 billion (1.7 billion pounds) in General Motors Co’s ( GM.N ) self-driving unit.\nLarge tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups including Uber Technologies Inc and Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ) are all stepping up efforts to gain pole position in the self-driving cars market, which is expected to carry the automobiles industry into the next era.

Delivery of the cars is expected to begin in late 2018.\nThe companies are also in early discussions about using Waymo’s technology in FCA cars to be sold in retail.\nAlphabet’s self-driving unit said in March it will also add up to 20,000 Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc electric vehicles to its upcoming autonomous fleet.\nWaymo, which says it has self-driven 6 million miles on public roads, said on Thursday it was on track to launch the world’s first self-driving transportation service later this year, which will allow passengers to use Waymo’s app to request a vehicle.\nThe company has plans to roll out a ride service for the public in the Phoenix, Arizona area in coming months, with plans to later launch it more widely.\nFCA, which has delivered 600 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Waymo till date, first announced its partnership with the company in May 2016.
