(NYSE:PRTY) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nJames M. Harrison, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased with the start of 2018 as both top and bottom line objectives were met, along with accelerated EPS growth. Reported revenue grew 6.5%, driven by a balance of strong brand comparable sales at retail, along with double-digit growth in our international business. The strength of our vertical model fueled gross margin expansion, while good progress was achieved against many key growth strategies. Furthermore, the retail division continued to realize the benefits from the productivity initiatives identified in 2017. As a result of the aforementioned factors, we achieved adjusted net income growth of nearly 14% and adjusted EBITDA growth of over 12%. We anticipate building on this progress throughout the year and are reiterating our full year 2018 guidance.”\nFirst Quarter Summary:\nTotal revenues increased 6.5% on a reported basis to $507.8 million and 5.1% on a constant currency basis. Retail sales increased 7.2% on a reported basis (6.7% on a constant currency basis), driven primarily by square footage growth from store acquisitions and a solid brand comparable sales increase. Brand comparable sales increased 2.4% during the first quarter, in part as a result of the beneficial timing shifts of both New Year’s Eve and Easter, partially offset by the negative effects of holiday compression. Net third-party wholesale revenues increased 4.3% on an adjusted basis when adjusting for the impacts of currency and franchise store acquisitions. Total gross profit margin increased 20 basis points to 37.2% of net sales, primarily due to higher share of shelf 1 , leverage from the increased sales and savings associated with in-store productivity initiatives, partially offset by increased distribution costs, higher wages and non-cash purchase accounting adjustments. Operating expenses totaled $168.6 million or 33.2% of revenues, representing a decrease of 110 basis points from Q1 2017, largely due to leverage and savings associated with retail productivity initiatives and the benefit from last year’s restructuring. Reported net loss of $1.2 million compared to net loss of $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income increased 13.7% to $6.9 million despite increased costs associated with higher interest rates and investments in Kazzam. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.3% to $55.1 million. Diluted loss per share totaled ($0.01), compared to ($0.04) in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted income per share increased 40% to $0.07 from $0.05 in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet Highlights as of March 31, 2018:\nThe Company ended the quarter with $1,837.9 million in debt (net of cash) resulting in net debt leverage 2 of 4.4 times and approximately $124 million in availability under its asset-based revolving credit facility.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook:\nFor 2018, the Company is reiterating the following guidance:\nTotal revenue of $2.44 to $2.49 billion Brand comparable sales growth of approximately 1% Adjusted EBITDA of $415 to $430 million Adjusted net income of $172 to $183 million Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76 to $1.87 Net debt leverage 2 of approximately 3.8 times by the end of 2018 GAAP net income of $143 to $154 million GAAP diluted EPS of $1.46 to $1.57\nThe Company has reconciled Non-GAAP outlook measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures later in this release. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" and “Reconciliation of 2018 Outlook” for a more detailed explanation, including definitions of the various Non-GAAP terms used in this release.\n1 The percentage of our retail product cost of sales supplied by our wholesale operations\n2 Defined as net debt to adjusted EBITDA\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results is scheduled for today, May 9, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The conference call will also be webcast at http://investor.partycity.com/ . To listen to the live call, please go to the website at least 15 minutes early to register and download any necessary audio software. The webcast will be accessible for one year after the call.\nWebsite Information\nWe routinely post important information for investors on the Investor Relations section of our website, http://investor.partycity.com/ . We intend to use this website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this document.\nNon-GAAP Information\nThis press release includes non-GAAP measures including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income/Loss and Adjusted Earnings per Share. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA: (i) as a factor in determining incentive compensation, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and (iii) because our credit facilities use Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants. The Company has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in tables accompanying this release. We also evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our prior-period local currency financial results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results. We also provide free cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, and net debt leverage, which is calculated by adding Loans and Notes Payable, Current Portion of Long Term Obligations and Long Term Obligations, Excluding Current Portion, subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents and dividing by Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve month period. Adjusted Earnings per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the Weighted Average Number of Common Shares-Diluted. We believe providing these non-GAAP measures provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations and leverage, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses or be involved in transactions that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. The Company has provided this information as a means to evaluate the results of its core operations. Other companies in the Company's industry may calculate these items differently than it does. Each of these measures is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
