Iran has no obligation to honour its commitments under the current situation ... It is a threat to peace and security ... I am not sure whether the European signatories of the deal will fulfill their promises,” Ali Larijani said.\n“It is obvious that Trump only understands the language of force.”\nTrump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of the deal, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.
