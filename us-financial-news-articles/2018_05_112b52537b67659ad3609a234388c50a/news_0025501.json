U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in April, suggesting that inflation was increasing at a moderate pace. \"The rally in regional markets reflects the U.S. markets performance last night after the inflation data eased concerns of a possible Fed tightening moving forward,\" said Lexter Azurin, a senior equity analyst at Manila-based AB Capital Securities. Asia shares ex-Japan rose nearly 1 percent, with investors also cheering U.S.-North Korean steps to further ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula. In Southeast Asia, Philippine shares closed 2.4 percent higher, a day after the central bank hiked the benchmark interest rates to 3.25 percent. Financials and industrials were among the top boosts with power generator Aboitiz Equity ventures rising 6 percent and BDO Unibank ending 3.3 percent higher. \"Most analysts were citing that recent inflation figures have in a way signalled that the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) might be behind the curve, so it was viewed positively by the markets today,\" Azurin said. Philippine shares gained 2.7 percent this week, the most since April 2017. Indonesian stocks jumped nearly 2 percent in intraday trading before closing 0.8 percent higher. Mining contractor United Tractors gained 7 percent, while Bank Negara Indonesia climbed 2.8 percent. Bank Indonesia said the rupiah's level was not reflecting fundamentals and that it had ample room to adjust the rate, giving another hint that it might raise rates to support the currency. Singapore shares ended nearly 1 percent higher, with DBS Group Holdings rising 2.2 percent and United Overseas Bank up 2.3 percent. Data out on Friday showed that the city-state's retail sales in March fell 1.5 percent from a year earlier, as sales of motor vehicles as well as computer and telecommunications equipment dropped. Vietnam stocks erased early falls to close 1.6 percent higher, while Malaysia was closed for a public holiday after general elections.
