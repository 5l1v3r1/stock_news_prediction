These additional wells bring the total to 67 wells drilled and completed since commencement of the horizontal drilling program; Generated net income of $64.4 million; Generated Adjusted EBITDA of $70.7 million; and Reduced commodity price risk by adding 6,000 Bbls/d of 2019 WTI crude oil swaps at average swap price of $58.88 per barrel.\nPaul T. Horne, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Legacy's general partner, commented, \"We started 2018 focused on our two-rig horizontal Permian drilling program having brought an additional 20 wells online late in the quarter with peak rates, on average, exceeding our expectations. Due to our lease-wide development approach, we experienced significant non-productive time during the quarter including dewatering and temporary shut-ins of offset wells. While this operational approach enables us to focus on maximizing long-term lease-wide economics, it certainly can hamper short-term field-level production results. We remain excited about our previously-announced transaction that will transition Legacy to a C-Corp and currently anticipate a mid-2018 closing of the transaction. We continue to believe this transition will be a crucial step in our move to a growth-oriented development company and play an important part in future company success.\"\nDan Westcott, President and Chief Financial Officer of Legacy's general partner, commented, \"Q1 proved to be an inflection point in Legacy's history as we announced our intention to transition to a C-Corp. We remain convinced of the key benefits of the transaction and, as we continue to work through the requisite steps to complete this transition, we will continue to focus on the efficient operation of our PDP base and development of our substantial horizontal Permian resource.\n\"We are thankful for the recent rise in oil prices. However, such increase has heightened the level of industry activity in the oil-rich Permian Basin and we, like other operators in the Basin, are now seeing some associated negative effects including wider commodity price differentials, third-party service constraints and increased production interference from increased development in and offsetting our densely developed leasehold. As longstanding, experienced players in the Permian, we will continue to utilize our strong local relationships and work through these industry-wide challenges. Despite some newly-projected delays and recently widened price differentials, we are very pleased with our well performance and expect continued success in our revised 2018 outlook. Importantly, we remain confident that our asset quality is high and our opportunity set deep.\"\nUpdated 2018 Guidance\nThe following table sets forth certain assumptions used by Legacy to estimate its anticipated results of operations for 2018 based on Legacy's expected 2018 capital program. These estimates do not include any acquisitions of additional oil or natural gas properties. In addition, these estimates are based on, among other things, assumptions of capital expenditure levels, current indications of supply and demand for oil and natural gas and current operating and labor costs. The guidance set forth below does not constitute any form of guarantee, assurance or promise that the matters indicated will actually be achieved. The guidance below sets forth management's best estimate based on current and anticipated market conditions and other factors. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and are subject to, among other things, significant business, economic, regulatory, environmental and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause materially from those we anticipate, as set forth under \"Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information.\"\nQ2-Q4 2018E Range\nFY 2018E Range\n($ in thousands unless otherwise noted)\nProduction:\nOil (Bbls/d)\n18,400\n-\n21,000\n18,101\n-\n20,060\nNatural gas liquids (Bbls/d)\n1,925\n-\n2,200\n2,053\n-\n2,261\nNatural gas (MMcf/d)\n158\n-\n171\n158\n-\n168\nTotal (Boe/d)\n46,658\n-\n51,700\n46,487\n-\n50,321\nWeighted average NYMEX differentials:\nOil (per Bbl)\n$(10.00)\n-\n$(7.50)\n$(7.94)\n-\n$(6.06)\nNGL realization (1)\n54%\n-\n60%\n54%\n-\n59%\nNatural gas (per Mcf)\n$(0.75)\n-\n$(0.55)\n$(0.64)\n-\n$(0.49)\nExpenses:\nLease operating expenses (2)\n$128,000\n-\n$138,000\n$173,585\n-\n$183,585\nAd valorem and production taxes (% of revenue)\n7.00%\n-\n7.50%\n7.02%\n-\n7.39%\nCash G&A expenses (3)\n$25,000\n-\n$28,000\n$34,502\n-\n$37,502\nCommodity derivative realizations\n$(6,000)\n-\n$(6,000)\n$(8,795)\n-\n$(8,795)\nAdjusted EBITDA (4) :\n$217,000\n-\n$262,000\n$287,698\n-\n$332,698\n(1)\nRepresents the projected percentage of assumed WTI crude oil prices.\n(2)\nExcludes ad valorem and production taxes.\n(3)\nConsistent with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, these figures exclude LTIP and transaction costs.\n(4)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure.

This was partially offset by natural production declines and individually immaterial divestitures completed in 2018 and 2017. Average realized price, excluding net cash settlements from commodity derivatives, increased 27% to $33.15 per Boe in 2018 from $26.07 per Boe in 2017 driven by the significant increase in commodity prices and increase in oil production as a percentage of total production. Average realized oil price increased 27% to $60.38 in 2018 from $47.39 in 2017 driven by an increase in the average WTI crude oil price of $11.29 per Bbl and increased Permian production which has realized better differentials than our other regions. Average realized natural gas price decreased 12% to $2.57 per Mcf in 2018 from $2.91 per Mcf in 2017. This decrease is primarily a result of widening realized regional differentials and our adoption of ASC 606 partially offset by an increase in average Henry Hub natural gas index price of $0.06 per Mcf. Finally, our average realized NGL price increased 21% to $0.80 per gallon in 2018 from $0.66 per gallon in 2017. Production expenses, excluding ad valorem taxes, decreased to $45.6 million in 2018 from $49.2 million in 2017, primarily due to cost containment efforts across all operating regions partially offset by increased well count related to our Permian horizontal drilling program and expenses associated with the additional working interests that reverted to us in connection with making the Acceleration Payment. On an average cost per Boe basis, production expenses excluding ad valorem taxes decreased 15% to $10.99 per Boe in 2018 from $12.89 per Boe in 2017. General and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\") compensation expense, increased to $11.3 million in 2018 from $8.7 million in 2017 due to general cost increases. LTIP compensation expense increased $10.9 million due to the recent rise in our unit price. Cash settlements paid on our commodity derivatives during 2018 were $2.8 million compared to cash receipts of $4.2 million in 2017. The change in cash settlements is a result of the combination of higher commodity prices and reduced nominal volumes hedged in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 as well as lower contracted hedge prices. Total development capital expenditures increased to $59.7 million in 2018 from $23.7 million in 2017. The 2018 activity was comprised mainly of our horizontal drilling program in Lea County, NM and Howard County, TX.\nCommodity Derivative Contracts\nWe enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to help mitigate the risk of changing commodity prices.

Following our prepared remarks, we will be pleased to answer questions from securities analysts and institutional portfolio managers and analysts; the complete call is open to all other interested parties on a listen-only basis.\nAbout Legacy Reserves LP\nLegacy Reserves LP is a master limited partnership headquartered in Midland, Texas, focused on the development of oil and natural gas properties primarily located in the Permian Basin, East Texas, Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United States. Additional information is available at www.LegacyLP.com .\nAdditional Information for Holders of Legacy Units and Where to Find It\nAlthough Legacy has suspended distributions to both the 8% Series A and Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the \"Preferred Units\"), such distributions continue to accrue. Pursuant to the terms of Legacy's partnership agreement, Legacy is required to pay or set aside for payment all accrued but unpaid distributions with respect to the Preferred Units prior to or contemporaneously with making any distribution with respect to Legacy's units. Accruals of distributions on the Preferred Units are treated for tax purposes as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that will generally be taxable to the holders of such Preferred Units as ordinary income even in the absence of contemporaneous distributions.\nIn addition, Legacy's unitholders, just like unitholders of other master limited partnerships, are allocated taxable income irrespective of cash distributions paid. Because Legacy's unitholders are treated as partners that are allocated a share of Legacy's taxable income irrespective of the amount of cash, if any, distributed by Legacy, unitholders will be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of Legacy's taxable income, including its taxable income associated with cancellation of debt (\"COD income\") or a disposition of property by Legacy, even if they receive no cash distributions from Legacy. As of January 21, 2016, Legacy has suspended all cash distributions to unitholders and holders of the Preferred Units. Legacy may engage in transactions to de-lever the Partnership and manage its liquidity that may result in the allocation of income and gain to its unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution. For example, if Legacy sells assets and uses the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital or operating expenditures, Legacy's unitholders may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale without receiving a cash distribution. Further, if Legacy engages in debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of its existing debt, these or similar transactions could result in \"cancellation of indebtedness\" or COD income being allocated to Legacy's unitholders as taxable income. For tax purposes, Legacy repurchased $187 million of its 6.625% Senior Notes at $0.70 per $1.00 principal amount on December 31, 2017. Unitholders will be allocated gain and income from asset sales and COD income and may owe income tax as a result of such allocations notwithstanding the fact that Legacy has suspended cash distributions to its unitholders. The ultimate effect of any such allocations will depend on the unitholder's individual tax position with respect to its units. Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the consequences of potential transactions that may result in income and gain to unitholders.\nAdditionally, if Legacy's unitholders, just like unitholders of other master limited partnerships, sell any of their units, they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those units. Prior distributions to unitholders that in the aggregate exceeded the cumulative net taxable income they were allocated for a unit decreased the tax basis in that unit, and will, in effect, become taxable income to Legacy's unitholders if the unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that unit, even if the price received is less than original cost. A substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income to Legacy's unitholders due to the potential recapture items, including depreciation, depletion and intangible drilling.\nIn connection with the proposed transaction that will transition Legacy from an MLP to a C-Corp (the \"Transaction\"), Legacy Reserves Inc. (\"New Legacy\") has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") a registration statement on Form S-4, which includes a preliminary proxy statement of Legacy and a preliminary prospectus of New Legacy (the \"proxy statement/prospectus\") which Legacy plans to mail to its unitholders to solicit approval for the merger.\nINVESTORS AND UNITHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED OR TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT LEGACY AND NEW LEGACY, AS WELL AS THE TRANSACTION AND RELATED MATTERS.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

The following presents a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to its nearest comparable generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as management believes it provides additional information concerning the performance of our business and is used by investors and financial analysts to analyze and compare our current operating and financial performance relative to past performance and such performances relative to that of other publicly traded partnerships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other publicly traded limited partnerships or limited liability companies because all companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner.\nCertain factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA may be viewed as temporary, one-time in nature, or being offset by reserves from past performance or near-term future performance. Financial results are also driven by various factors that do not typically occur evenly throughout the year that are difficult to predict, including rig availability, weather, well performance, the timing of drilling and completions and near-term commodity price changes.\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities, or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In thousands)\nNet income\n$\n64,382\n$\n16,372\nPlus:\nInterest expense\n27,368\n20,133\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n(51,693)\n—\nIncome tax expense\n487\n421\nDepletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion\n36,547\n28,796\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n—\n8,062\nGain on disposal of assets\n(20,395)\n(5,524)\nEquity in income of equity method investees\n(17)\n(11)\nUnit-based compensation expense\n12,806\n1,897\nMinimum payments received in excess of overriding royalty interest earned (1)\n522\n445\nNet (gains) losses on commodity derivatives\n1,704\n(34,669)\nNet cash settlements (paid) received on commodity derivatives\n(2,795)\n4,236\nTransaction costs\n1,782\n32\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n70,698\n$\n40,190\n(1)\nMinimum payments received in excess of overriding royalties earned under a contractual agreement expiring December 31, 2019.
