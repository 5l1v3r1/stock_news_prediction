The nameplate of political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, is seen in central London, Britain March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\nCambridge Analytica LLC listed assets in the range of $100,001 to $500,000 (74,200 to 371,078 pounds) and liabilities in the range of $1 million to $10 million.\nLondon-based Cambridge Analytica was created in 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from Mercer and a name chosen by former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, according to a report by the New York Times.\nFacebook has faced multiple investigations in the United States and Europe over its handling of personal data of users, hurting shares of the Mark Zuckerberg-led company.\nZuckerberg has appeared before U.S. congressional committees to testify on data privacy and will meet leaders of the European Parliament soon.\nFacebook said on Monday it has suspended around 200 apps in the first stage of its review into apps that had access to large quantities of user data before the company restricted data access.
