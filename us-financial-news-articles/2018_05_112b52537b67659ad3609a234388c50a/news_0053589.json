In all, 13 protests have been killed this week.\nResidents and environmental activists say emissions from the plant, India’s second biggest, are polluting the air and water, affecting people’s health.\nThe plant has been shut for more than 50 days and had been ordered to stay closed until at least June 6, pending environmental clearances.\nVedanta has denied that the smelter has been polluting the air and water.\nReuters has sought comment from the company over the allegation that it was trying to resume production but company spokesman were not immediately available for comment.
