(NASDAQ: ZAIS) (\"ZAIS\" or the \"Company\") today announced that independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (\"ISS\") and Glass Lewis & Co. (\"Glass Lewis\"), have recommended that the Company's stockholders vote FOR the \"going private\" merger proposal described in the Company's proxy statement for its 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Annual Meeting\") to be held at 9 a.m. (Eastern Time) on May 17, 2018 at the Oyster Point Hotel, 146 Bodman Place, Red Bank, NJ 07701.\nIn its report, ISS stated: \"In light of the thorough auction process and positive market reaction, support for this transaction is warranted.\"\nIn its report, Glass Lewis stated: \"Overall, we recognize that the board has taken considerable steps to evaluate potential alternatives prior to entering into the proposed transaction agreement and we see no reason to doubt that the proposed transaction likely represents the most favorable offer available to shareholders at the present time.\"\nBoth ISS and Glass Lewis noted that the $4.10 per share price to be paid to unaffiliated stockholders in the merger represents a premium of more than 138% to the closing price of the Company's shares on September 5, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement that the Company had received a going private proposal.\nAt the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the \"Merger Agreement\"), dated as of January 11, 2018, by and among the Company, ZGH Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\"Sub\"), and Z Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company of which Christian Zugel, the Company's Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, is the sole managing member (\"Z Acquisition\"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the \"Merger\") and each share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (\"Class A Common Stock\"), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than certain excluded shares of Class A Common Stock) will be converted into the right to receive $4.10 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Stockholders of record at the close of business on April 2, 2018 may vote at the Annual Meeting.\nThe Company also announced that the purchase of 6,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Amended and Restated Share Purchase Agreement, dated January 11, 2018, between Z Acquisition and Ramguard LLC was consummated on May 1, 2018. The consummation of such share purchase satisfies one of the conditions to the obligation of the Company to effect the Merger.\nMacKenzie Partners, Inc. is assisting ZAIS with its efforts to solicit proxies in connection with the Merger. Any stockholders who have questions about voting their shares should contact MacKenzie Partners, Inc. via telephone toll free at (800) 322-2885 or by email at proxy@mackenziepartners.com.\nABOUT ZAIS GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.\nZAIS is a publicly traded company that owns a majority interest in, and is the managing member of, ZAIS Group Parent, LLC (\"ZGP\").
