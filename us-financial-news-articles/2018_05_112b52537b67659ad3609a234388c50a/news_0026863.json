Human Rights Council, denies accusations of widespread rights abuses against its people.\nA 2014 report by a U.N. commission of inquiry cataloged massive violations including large prison camps, starvation and executions.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:32:47.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
