Rebholz, TA's CEO, made the following statement regarding the 2018 first quarter results:\n\"During the first quarter of 2018, we continued to gain traction in our business initiatives. Our efforts continued to make progress against the combined headwinds of increased fuel efficiency and competition we have been experiencing and we continued to grow our nonfuel businesses. For same sites in our travel centers segment, nonfuel revenues were up 3.9% over the prior year quarter and nonfuel gross margin was up 5.2%, driven largely by our truck service programs and other retail services, such as parking and showers. We also continued to see success with our cost control initiatives. On a same site basis, site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues improved by 90 basis points and by 150 basis points in our travel centers segment. The operating results we saw during the first quarter of this year leave me optimistic that we will further grow our business and improve our profitability as we continue through 2018.\"\nBusiness Commentary\nFuel sales volume increased modestly and same site fuel sales volume decreased by 3.6 million gallons, or 0.7%, for the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter. TA believes the slight fuel sales volume decrease on a same site basis experienced during the 2018 first quarter primarily resulted from the continued effects of fuel efficiency gains and increased competition. Fuel revenues increased by $177.3 million, or 19.2%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily due to higher market prices for fuel during the 2018 first quarter and newly acquired and developed locations. Fuel gross margin increased by $20.4 million, or 27.9%, as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily as a result of the $23.3 million benefit recognized in the 2018 first quarter in connection with the February 2018 retroactive reinstatement for 2017 of the federal biodiesel tax credit. Without this discrete item, fuel gross margin declined by $2.9 million.\nNonfuel revenues increased by $16.2 million, or 3.5%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter, including a $12.2 million same site increase and a $4.0 million increase attributable to new sites. The increase on a same site basis was primarily due to an increase in truck service and parking programs. Nonfuel gross margin increased by $14.6 million, or 5.5%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter, including a $12.0 million same site increase and a $2.6 million increase attributable to new sites. The increase in nonfuel gross margin was primarily due to the increase in nonfuel revenues and an increase in the nonfuel gross margin percentage. The nonfuel gross margin percentage was 58.8% for the 2018 first quarter as compared to 57.7% for the 2017 first quarter; the increase in the nonfuel gross margin percentage was primarily due to a change in the mix of products and services sold.\nSite level operating expenses increased by $3.6 million, or 1.5%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter due to a $2.0 million same site increase and a $1.6 million increase from sites acquired and developed since the beginning of the 2017 first quarter. The increase on a same site basis was primarily due to increased labor costs related to the increase in nonfuel sales. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was 51.9% for the 2018 first quarter as compared to 53.0% for the 2017 first quarter. The improvement in site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was primarily the result of excess transaction fees of $1.8 million charged by Comdata, Inc., or Comdata, in the 2017 first quarter and the realization of certain cost saving initiatives in the 2018 first quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the 2018 first quarter decreased by $3.3 million, or 7.9%, as compared to the 2017 first quarter, primarily attributable to litigation costs related to TA's litigation with Comdata expensed during the 2017 first quarter.\nReal estate rent expense increased by $2.8 million, or 4.1%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter, primarily from TA's sale to, and lease back from, Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT, of a travel center and improvements at leased sites since the beginning of 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $4.3 million, or 13.4%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily resulting from the write offs of certain assets during the 2017 first quarter.\nNet loss for the 2018 first quarter was $10.1 million as compared to $29.4 million for the 2017 first quarter. Adjusted net loss for the 2018 first quarter was $26.8 million as compared to $21.0 million for the 2017 first quarter. The increase in adjusted net loss was primarily due to the decrease in fuel gross margin, an increase in real estate rent expense and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the 2018 first quarter was $0.25 per common share as compared to $0.74 per common share for the 2017 first quarter. Adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders for the 2018 first quarter was $0.67 per common share as compared to $0.53 per common share for the 2017 first quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the 2018 first quarter decreased by $0.6 million as compared to the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to the decrease in fuel gross margin, an increase in real estate rent expense and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTravel Centers Segment\nFuel sales volume increased by 1.5 million gallons, or 0.3%, for the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter due to newly acquired and developed locations. Same site fuel sales volume decreased by 2.8 million gallons, or 0.6%, due to the continued effects of fuel efficiency gains and increased competition. Fuel revenues increased by $164.3 million, or 20.5%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily due to higher market prices for fuel and from sites acquired and developed since the beginning of the 2017 first quarter. Fuel gross margin increased by $20.5 million, or 33.2%, to $82.4 million primarily as a result of the $23.3 million benefit recognized in the 2018 first quarter in connection with the February 2018 retroactive reinstatement for 2017 of the federal biodiesel tax credit and from an increase from newly acquired and developed locations.\nNonfuel revenues increased by $20.2 million, or 5.1%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily due to a $15.3 million, or 3.9%, increase on a same site basis primarily as a result of TA's truck service and parking programs. Nonfuel gross margin increased by $15.4 million, or 6.4%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter due to an increase in nonfuel revenues and an increase in the nonfuel gross margin percentage. Nonfuel gross margin percentage was 61.8% in the 2018 first quarter as compared to 61.0% in the 2017 first quarter; the increased nonfuel gross margin percentage was primarily the result of changes in the mix of products and services sold.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses increased by $31.5 million, or 34.1%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily due to an increase at same sites.\nOn a same site basis, (223 locations) site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses increased in the 2018 first quarter by $29.2 million, or 32.5%, as compared to the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to a $19.0 million increase in fuel gross margin that resulted primarily as a result of a one time reduction in TA's fuel costs of goods sold related to the retroactive reinstatement for 2017 of the federal biodiesel tax credit and an increase in nonfuel gross margin due to the increase in both nonfuel revenues and nonfuel gross margin percentage.\nConvenience Stores Segment\nFuel sales volume decreased by 1.0 million gallons, or 1.8%, for the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the continued effects of competition. Fuel revenues increased by $11.3 million, or 10.9%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily due to higher market prices for fuel. Fuel gross margin decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.9%, to $11.1 million as a result of a decrease in fuel sales volume.\nNonfuel revenues decreased by $2.3 million, or 3.8%, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter primarily due to increased competition. Nonfuel gross margin remained flat in the 2018 first quarter as compared to the 2017 first quarter. Nonfuel gross margin percentage was 36.1% in the 2018 first quarter as compared to 34.8% in the 2017 first quarter. The increase in nonfuel gross margin percentage was primarily the result of changes in the mix of products sold.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses decreased in the 2018 first quarter by $0.5 million, or 8.4%, as compared to the 2017 first quarter due to an increase in site level operating expenses and a decrease in fuel gross margin.\nConference Call:\nOn Monday, May 7, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, TA will host a conference call to discuss its financial results and other activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

These non-GAAP financial measures also may help investors to make comparisons between TA and other companies and to make comparisons of TA's financial and operating results between periods.\nTA believes that adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per common share attributable to common shareholders are meaningful disclosures that may help investors to better understand TA's financial performance by providing financial information that represents TA's operating results without the effects of items that do not result directly from TA's normal recurring operations and may allow investors to better compare TA's performance between periods and to the performance of other companies. Management uses these measures in developing internal budgets and forecasts and analyzing TA's performance.\nTA believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are meaningful disclosures that may help investors to better understand TA's financial performance, including by allowing investors to compare TA's performance between periods and to the performance of other companies. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate TA's financial performance and compare TA's performance over time and to the performance of other companies. Management also uses these measures in developing internal budgets and forecasts and analyzing its performance. TA calculates EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, as shown below. TA calculates adjusted EBITDA by excluding items that are considered not to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses or gains or losses. TA also believes that adjusted EBITDA provides financial information that represents TA's operating results without the effects of items that do not result directly from TA's normal recurring operations.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures TA presents should not be considered as alternatives to net loss attributable to common shareholders, net loss or loss from operations as an indicator of TA's operating performance or as a measure of TA's liquidity. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures TA presents may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts calculated by other companies.\nTA believes that net loss is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and that net loss per common share attributable to common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted net loss per common share attributable to common shareholders. The following tables present the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the respective most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Calculation of adjusted net loss: Net loss $ (10,078 ) $ (29,375 ) Less: Federal biodiesel tax credit (1) (23,251 ) — Add: Comdata legal expenses (2) 78 6,372 Add: Asset write offs (3) — 5,227 Add: Comdata excess transaction fees (4) — 1,813 Add: Incremental share based compensation expense (5) 1,027 173 Add (less): Income tax provision (6) 5,470 (5,230 ) Adjusted net loss $ (26,754 ) $ (21,020 ) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Calculation of adjusted net loss per common share attributable to common shareholders:\nNet loss per common share attributable to common shareholders $ (0.25 ) $ (0.74 ) Less: Federal biodiesel tax credit (1) (0.58 ) — Add: Comdata legal expenses (2) — 0.16 Add: Asset write offs (3) — 0.13 Add: Comdata excess transaction fees (4) — 0.05 Add: Incremental share based compensation expense (5) 0.02 — Add (less): Income tax provision (6) 0.14 (0.13 ) Adjusted net loss per common share attributable to common shareholders\n$ (0.67 ) $ (0.53 ) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Calculation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA: Net loss $ (10,078 ) $ (29,375 ) Less: Benefit for income taxes (4,626 ) (19,298 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization 27,548 31,800 Add: Interest expense, net 7,588 7,384 EBITDA 20,432 (9,489 ) Less: Federal biodiesel tax credit (1) (23,251 ) — Add: Comdata legal expenses (2) 78 6,372 Add: Comdata excess transaction fees (4) — 1,813 Add: Incremental share based compensation expense (5) 1,027 173 Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,714 ) $ (1,131 ) (1) Federal biodiesel tax credit. On February 8, 2018, legislation was passed that retroactively reinstated the 2017 federal biodiesel tax credit. The federal biodiesel tax credit for 2017 was $23.3 million and was recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(2) Comdata legal expenses. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, TA incurred $0.1 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of legal fees in its litigation with Comdata. TA's attorneys' fees and costs related to this matter totaled $10.6 million through March 31, 2018. On April 9, 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the Court, entered its final order and judgment, or the Order. Pursuant to the Order, Comdata is required to, among other things, reimburse TA for attorneys' fees and costs, together with interest, in the amount of $10.7 million, which TA collected in April 2018. Comdata has 30 days from the date of the Order to file a notice of appeal. If Comdata does not appeal, TA believes legal fees that it may incur for this matter during the remainder of 2018 will not be material.\n(3) Asset write offs. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, TA wrote off assets which totaled $5.2 million in connection with TA's cost reduction initiatives.\n(4) Comdata excess transaction fees. From February 1, 2017, until mid-September 2017, Comdata unilaterally withheld increased fees from the transaction settlement payments due to TA under an agreement between TA and Comdata under which TA agreed to accept Comdata issued fuel cards through January 2, 2022, for certain purchases by TA's customers in exchange for fees payable by TA to Comdata, or the Merchant Agreement. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, TA incurred $1.8 million of excess transaction fees. On September 11, 2017, the Court issued its post-trial Memorandum Opinion. The Court found that TA was entitled to, among other things, an order requiring Comdata to specifically perform under the Merchant Agreement, and awarded damages to TA and against Comdata for the difference between the higher transaction fees paid to Comdata since February 1, 2017, and what TA would have paid during this period under the fee structure in the Merchant Agreement. In November 2017, TA recovered $6.9 million for the amount of excess transaction fees.\n(5) Incremental share based compensation expense. As part of TA's retirement agreements with certain former officers, TA agreed to accelerate the vesting of previously granted share awards. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, this acceleration resulted in $1.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of incremental share based compensation expense as compared to what TA would have expensed in the absence of these retirement agreements.\n(6) Non-GAAP financial measures net tax impact. The tax impact of the exclusion of the above items from net loss to arrive at adjusted net loss was calculated using TA's estimated statutory rate of 24.7% and 38.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in the estimated statutory rate is due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nTRAVELCENTERS OF AMERICA LLC\nSUPPLEMENTAL RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT EFFECT\n(in thousands, except per gallon amounts)\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2014-09, which establishes a comprehensive revenue recognition standard under GAAP for almost all industries. TA adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method, which required that TA restate its consolidated financial statements for prior year comparative periods. Although the majority of TA's revenue is initiated at the point of sale, the implementation of this standard impacted the accounting for TA's loyalty programs, initial franchise fees and advertising contributions received from franchisees.\nThe recognition of loyalty awards in accordance with ASU 2014-09 resulted in a reclassification between nonfuel and fuel revenues. This reclassification resulted in a decrease to fuel gross margin per gallon and an increase to nonfuel gross margin percentage. The adjusted fuel revenues, fuel gross margin per gallon, nonfuel revenues and nonfuel gross margin percentage for each quarter of 2017 and 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, is as follows:\nAs Reported Adoption of\nASU 2014-09\nAs Adjusted Fuel revenues: Three months ended March 31, 2017 $ 935,296 $ (12,422 ) $ 922,874 Three months ended June 30, 2017 990,265 (14,046 ) 976,219 Three months ended September 30, 2017 1,055,593 (19,814 ) 1,035,779 Three months ended December 31, 2017 1,109,758 (19,341 ) 1,090,417 Year ended December 31, 2017 4,090,912 (65,623 ) 4,025,289 Three months ended March 31, 2016 $ 709,528 $ (14,622 ) $ 694,906 Three months ended June 30, 2016 931,211 (14,802 ) 916,409 Three months ended September 30, 2016 947,558 (15,223 ) 932,335 Three months ended December 31, 2016 941,852 (11,830 ) 930,022 Year ended December 31, 2016 3,530,149 (56,477 ) 3,473,672 As Reported Adoption of\nASU 2014-09 (1)\nAs Adjusted Fuel gross margin per gallon: Three months ended March 31, 2017 $ 0.166 $ (0.024 ) $ 0.142 Three months ended June 30, 2017 0.192 (0.026 ) 0.166 Three months ended September 30, 2017 0.189 (0.036 ) 0.153 Three months ended December 31, 2017 0.184 (0.036 ) 0.148 Year ended December 31, 2017 0.183 (0.030 ) 0.153 Three months ended March 31, 2016 $ 0.170 $ (0.027 ) $ 0.143 Three months ended June 30, 2016 0.182 (0.027 ) 0.155 Three months ended September 30, 2016 0.194 (0.027 ) 0.167 Three months ended December 31, 2016 0.189 (0.022 ) 0.167 Year ended December 31, 2016 0.184 (0.026 ) 0.158 (1) The effect ASU 2014-09 will have on fuel gross margin per gallon will vary from period to period as a result of changes in certain factors that figure into the underlying calculations, including, but not limited to, fuel prices, the value of loyalty awards and loyalty program redemption rates.
