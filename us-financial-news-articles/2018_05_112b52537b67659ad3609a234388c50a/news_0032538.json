Two-thirds of votes by Hyundai Mobis ( 012330.KS ) shareholders present need to be in favor of the deal for it to be successful.\nForeign shareholders own nearly half of Mobis, which is set to be the group’s de facto holding firm, but Hyundai’s chairman and the group’s affiliates own around 30 percent.\nLee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities, said the vote could depend on the position of South Korea’s National Pension Service fund and that Elliott would have less clout than in other battles it has waged in South Korea as it is not that big a shareholder in Mobis.\n“The NPS, which has a stake of almost 10 percent, has the casting vote, and if it does not oppose the plan, there is a higher chance that the deal will get approval,” he said.\nNPS declined to comment.\nThe chief of South Korea’s antitrust agency, Kim Sang-jo, has said the plan was a “positive” step towards improving the group’s ownership structure.\nLast month, Elliott, which owns more than 1.5 percent of Mobis, proposed what it called a more efficient holding company structure and more independent board members.\nHyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) and Hyundai Mobis have since announced share buybacks and cancellations in the hope of bringing shareholders on side. But Elliott has said these do not go far enough to address corporate governance issues.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul and Liana Baker in New York; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:28:06.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
