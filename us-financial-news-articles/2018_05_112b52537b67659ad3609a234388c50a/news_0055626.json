He walked two and struck out six while taking part in his second combined shutout of the season.\nJuan Nicasio pitched a one-hit eighth inning before Mariners closer Edwin Diaz slammed the door in the ninth for his 17th save, striking out the side on just 13 pitches.\nMariners pitchers fanned 10 in the game.\nThe A’s got just one baserunner into scoring position in the game, that coming when Gonzales walked Chad Pinder and Lowrie to start the fourth inning.\nPinder reached third with one out on Matt Chapman’s fly ball to center field, before Gonzales struck out Mark Canha and retired Matt Olson on a fly ball to left.\nDaniel Gossett (0-2) took the hard-luck loss.\nAfter having been demoted to the minors earlier in the season, Gossett re-emerged to limit the Mariners to four hits and just the one unearned run in seven innings. He walked one and struck out five.\nHeredia had two hits for the Mariners, who have won five in a row overall and three straight on the road.\nJohn Andreoli, promoted from Triple-A Tacoma earlier in the day, recorded his first major league hit in his second at-bat against Gossett, a one-out single to right field in the fifth inning. He finished 1-for-3 with a walk.\nRyan Dull, Daniel Coulombe and Santiago Casilla combined for two shutout innings of relief for the A’s, who took their fifth straight home loss and their sixth defeat in eight meetings with the Mariners this season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:27:41.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
