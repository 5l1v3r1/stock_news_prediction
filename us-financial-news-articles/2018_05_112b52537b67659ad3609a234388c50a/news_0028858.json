It has said it would defend itself against the two lawsuits that have been filed.[nL3N1SG72R]\n“Investors have every right to be disappointed with AMP’s conduct,” Andrew Watson, the National Head of Class Actions at law firm Maurice Blackburn, said in a statement.\nMaurice Blackburn said its suit would offer “extraordinarily low funding commissions” and would not charge fees unless it won, a sign of competition between firms to sign up AMP shareholders.\nThe Maurice Blackburn action is being funded by Singapore-based International Litigation Funding Partners. The Maurice Blackburn statement did not disclose how much its litigation funder would receive if it won.\nGlobal law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, and Melbourne-based firm Phi Finney McDonald tabled two separate actions against AMP last week.\nThe Australian Financial Review has reported Australian firms Slater & Gordon Ltd and Shine Lawyers Pty Ltd are also preparing lawsuits against AMP. Slater & Gordon and Shine were not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Paulina Duran; Editing by Byron Kaye and Stephen Coates\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
