They have won it once, beating the Netherlands 1-0 in the 2010 final in South Africa with an extra-time strike from Andres Iniesta.\nBefore then they had reached the quarter-finals in 1934, 1986, 1994 and 2002 but lost every time. As holders they suffered a shock elimination from the group stage in 2014.\nCoach: Julen Lopetegui\nFormer goalkeeper Lopetegui spent most of his career with Logrones and Rayo Vallecano and had brief stints at Real Madrid and Barcelona. He made one appearance for Spain and was an unused substitute at the 1994 World Cup.\nHe coached Rayo Vallecano and Real Madrid’s reserve team before going into Spain’s youth team set-up, leading the under-21 team to glory at the 2013 European Championship with a side containing future first teamers Isco, Koke and David de Gea.\nAfter being sacked following a trophy-less 18 months at FC Porto he was named Vicente del Bosque’s successor in July 2016. He has rejuvenated the squad with many of his former charges from the under-21 side and helped them to recover their attacking flair, refocusing on a possession-based style of play but making them faster and more dangerous on the counter-attack.\nKey players:\nIsco: Lopetegui knows how to get the best out of the Real Madrid playmaker. He can play across midfield, behind the striker or even as a deep lying center-forward and ran riot in impressive wins over Italy and Argentina.\nAndres Iniesta: The Barcelona veteran has conducted Spain’s all-powerful midfield for more than a decade and was the heartbeat of their world dominance between 2008 and 2012.\nStill as masterful on the ball as ever at 34 years of age, he will be looking for one last hurrah in Russia before quitting international football and leaving Barca.\nSergio Ramos: The center back and captain has developed a win-at-all-costs mentality and knows exactly how to manage the biggest games. An unforgiving opponent for attackers due to his physical presence and never-say-die attitude, Ramos’s experience of four Champions League finals with Real Madrid and five major tournaments will be vital to Spain’s hopes.\nForm guide:\nSpain have not lost since their Euro 2016 last-16 defeat to Italy and have won 13 out of 18 games with Lopetegui, drawing five. They comprehensively beat France and Belgium in international friendlies and proved their credentials by ripping apart Argentina 6-1 in their last outing.\nHow they qualified:\nSpain breezed their way through qualifying by winning every game aside from a 1-1 draw away to Italy, whom they outclassed 3-0 at home to finish above them and top of their group, scoring 36 goals in 10 games.\nProspects:\nSpain will face a testing opener against European champions Portugal which is likely to determine whether they finish top of Group B, which also contains Iran and Morocco.\nIf they win the group they are likely to face either Uruguay or Egypt in the last 16, with a possible quarter-final against Argentina, Croatia or France coming next.\nGiven the talent in the squad and their form under Lopetegui, a semi-final appearance should be the minimal target, although they will feel confident they can go all the way.\nReporting by Richard Martin; editing by Martyn Herman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:33:21.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
