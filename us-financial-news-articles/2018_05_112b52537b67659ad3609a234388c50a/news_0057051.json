Newspaper Valor Econômico had reported on Monday that Petrobras had proposed such a plan.\n$1 = 3.71 reais Reporting by Marcela Ayres; Writing by Bruno Federowski Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:57:33.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
