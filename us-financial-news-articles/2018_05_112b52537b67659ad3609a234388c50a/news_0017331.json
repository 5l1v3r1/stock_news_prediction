Wilshire declined to comment.\nWhile hedge funds have delivered lackluster returns and investor confidence has ebbed for a number of years, industry analysts say the asset class may find new favor now that market volatility has returned and investors are eager for firms like Wilshire to help them create portfolios and research managers.\nAmato joined Wilshire after a decade at Dorchester Capital, an alternative investment firm where he was a partner and managed portfolios of hedge funds and oversaw research and risk management groups.\nLast week Andrew Jarrous, a vice president for hedge fund manager research who covered global macro and relative value strategies and reported to Amato, also left Wilshire.\nJarrous is joining HighMark Capital Management, the investment management arm of Union Bank. He will reunite with former colleagues Razmig Der-Tavitian and James St. Aubin who left the Wilshire alternative investment team in 2015. Jarrous did not respond to messages seeking comment.\nWilshire Associates was founded by Dennis Tito in 1972 and ranks among the industry’s best known consulting and investment firms. It developed the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, which is widely viewed as a benchmark for U.S. stocks performance.
