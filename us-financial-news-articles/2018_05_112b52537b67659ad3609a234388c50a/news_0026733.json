REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao Duterte’s lawyer Salvador Panelo and government spokesman Harry Roque issued separate statements asking the public to respect the ruling.\nThe scene outside the court in Manila was calm after the ruling. Crowds of supporters and opponents of Sereno had gathered outside the building before the ruling.\nOpposition politicians denounced Sereno’s removal.\nSenator Risa Hontiveros called it “a direct stab to the heart of our Constitution”, while her Akbayan party said the country was “a heartbeat away” from the death of its democracy.\n“After having a lapdog Congress and a seriously wounded Senate, we now have a puppet Supreme Court,” the party said in a statement.\nDuterte has made no secret of his dislike of Sereno.\nShe voted against several of his proposals, such as extending martial law on a restive island and allowing late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in a cemetery for national heroes.\nIn October last year, Duterte dared Sereno to open her bank account to public scrutiny, accusing her of corruption and of being used by his political opponents.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Friday’s decision came before Congress, controlled by Duterte’s allies, returns from its Easter break next week to vote on an impeachment complaint against Sereno.\nAdditional Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Darren Schuettler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
