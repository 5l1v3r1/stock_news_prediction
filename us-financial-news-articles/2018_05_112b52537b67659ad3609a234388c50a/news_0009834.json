It did not say when that meeting would take place.\nNBG said last week it would press on with plans to sell its wholly-owned insurance subsidiary Ethniki Insurance, after a deal to sell 75 percent of the business turned sour earlier this year.\nNBG put the insurance unit up for sale as part of a restructuring plan approved by the European Union to exit non-banking operations.\nThe European Central Bank is due to issue the results of stress tests - a financial check up - of Greece’s four systemic banks on Saturday, which includes NBG.
