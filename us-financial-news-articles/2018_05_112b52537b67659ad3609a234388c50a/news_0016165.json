It also says a majority of voters back phasing out nuclear power.\nVattenfall, much of whose turnover is derived from its activities in Germany, had to permanently idle the Kruemmel and Brunsbuettel reactors in northern Germany in 2011 when the government decided to immediately close old reactors and accelerate the exit programmes for the remaining ones.\n$1 = 0.8418 euros Reporting by Gernot Heller; Writing by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:33:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
