(NASDAQ:STLR) (the “Company” or “Stellar”) today announced that with respect to its special meeting of stockholders to be held on May 22, 2018, the Company is shortening the extended date by which the Company has to complete its initial business combination from November 26, 2018 to August 24, 2018 (the “Extension”). In addition, the Company announced that it has been advised by Astra Maritime Corp., Dominium Investments Inc., Magellan Investments Corp. and Firmus Investments Inc. (collectively, the “Sponsor”), that the Sponsor has agreed to increase the amount being loaned to Stellar from $0.02 to $0.035 per month for each public share that is not redeemed by its shareholders (the “Contribution”) in connection with the special meeting. Upon receipt of the Contribution, the Company will deposit such funds into its trust account, which will increase the pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account in the event of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination or liquidation from approximately $10.38 per share to up to approximately $10.48 per share. The Contribution is conditioned upon the implementation of the Extension.\nAdditional information relating to the Contribution, the Extension and related matters can be found in the definitive proxy statement filed by Stellar with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 4, 2018 and the supplement to the definitive proxy statement filed by Stellar with the SEC on May 11, 2018.\nAbout Stellar\nStellar is a blank check company, also commonly referred to as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, asset acquisition or other business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Stellar’s units, shares of common stock and warrants are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “STLRU,” “STLR” and “STLRW,\" respectively.
