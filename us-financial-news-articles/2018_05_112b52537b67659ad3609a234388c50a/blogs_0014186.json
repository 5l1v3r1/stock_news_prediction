The good : The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent during the month, the lowest level since December 2000, while black unemployment dropped to an all-time low 6.6 percent.\n2. The bad : Total job creation of 164,000 and wage growth of 2.6 percent on a year-over-year both were below economist expectations.\n3.
