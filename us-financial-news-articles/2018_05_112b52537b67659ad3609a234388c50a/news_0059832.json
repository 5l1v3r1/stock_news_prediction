I see a lot of what’s happening with him mirroring the same road I had.”\nMcAteer said Alexander-Arnold was still learning his trade but had done well to hold his own in a strong Liverpool side.\n“He’s not the finished article by any means, there’s still a lot of things he needs to work on, but he’s done exceptionally well in his first season,” he added.\nMcAteer, who played in all of the Republic of Ireland’s games in the United States as Jack Charlton’s team reached the last 16 of the 1994 tournament, would then leave Bolton Wanderers to join Liverpool the following summer, where he played for four seasons.\nAlexander-Arnold made his senior debut for the Merseyside club in October 2016 after progressing through its academy.\n“If Clyne had had a fit season we’d be talking completely differently,” said McAteer. “But one man’s loss is another man’s gain and he’s had to take it with two hands and do the business and that’s what he’s done.\n“He’s on the plane to go to Russia, so he’s been rewarded in that way. Whether he plays or not, I don’t know but it’s a great experience for him and it’s all part of the learning curve. It will stand him in good stead for the future.”\nMcAteer said the Liverpool defender also had the kind of attitude required to build on the success he has had to date.\n“You learn more from your mistakes and losses,” he said. “We can all ride the crest of a wave and love it.\n“But with his temperament, he wants to learn and he wants to know what his problems are and to make them better.\n“That’s a breath of fresh air in this modern football society that we live in, because there are a lot of young players when it comes to them very quickly they don’t want to learn and they think they’ve arrived.\n“He’s certainly not like that, he’s not that kind of lad.”\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:21:12.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
