So delighted to come out on the right side of the result,” Leinster coach Stuart Lancaster said.\n“I thought Racing were outstanding today, really put pressure on us at the breakdown.”\nRacing suffered their second final defeat in three years.

They did what they had to do to win the game. They deserved to win,” Racing coach Laurent Travers said.\nThe French side paid for their lack of discipline.\n“We were very close. I think we could have won. At our level it is all about details and our discipline was poor in the first half,” flanker Yannick Nyanga said.\n“We had a big heart today, but that’s not enough.” Slideshow (11 Images)\nRacing came close to forcing extra time after the buzzer when stand-in flyhalf Remi Tales’s drop goal flew just wide.\nRacing, also missing first-choice scrumhalf Maxime Machenaud, suffered a major blow when Carter, named on the replacements bench, was ruled out an hour before kickoff due to a hamstring injury.\nStarting flyhalf Pat Lambie sustained a knee injury in the second minute, so French international Tales, who did not feature on the team list in the morning, had to deputise.\nRacing went ahead with an Iribaren penalty but Sexton levelled.\nThey traded a couple more penalties before the interval after the French side defended aggressively, disrupting Leinster’s usually well-oiled machine.\nThe normally free-flowing Irish side, who eight games in the competition, were being kept at bay.\nRacing took command in the second half as they went through the phases and were rewarded with an early penalty converted by Iribaren.\nBut Sexton responded with a penalty and Iribaren’s fourth penalty was cancelled out by Nacewa’s boot.\nAnother Racing offside infringement was sanctioned by Wayne Barnes and winger Nacewa coolly slotted home the winning kick one minute from time.
