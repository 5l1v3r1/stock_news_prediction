U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad said the two countries remain “very far apart” regarding a tariff resolution, after which White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Politico he supports efforts to reach an agreement.\n“In general terms, we have a trade skirmish not a trade war,” said Anthony Chan, Chase Chief Economist JP Morgan in New York. “Longer term, we believe these trade issues will be resolved but on a day-to-day basis they lead to some consternation from investors.”\nU.S. retail sales increased at a moderate 0.3 percent in April as rising gasoline prices took a bite out of discretionary spending, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\nBut core retail sales - which exclude gasoline, automobiles, building materials and food services - rose at a brisker 0.4 monthly pace over March, suggesting consumer spending is accelerating after its first quarter slowdown.\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose to its highest level since July 2011 on the news, raising expectations for further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n“It really tells you that there’s no justification at all for the Federal Reserve to slow down the growth pace, which tells you that maybe this hiking thing and long term yields is real,” Chan said.\nAt 2:28 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 215.3 points, or 0.86 percent, to 24,684.11, the S&P 500 lost 22.13 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,708 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 73.69 points, or 0.99 percent, to 7,337.62.\nThe losses were broad based, with all 11 major S&P sectors in negative territory.\nHome Depot Inc shares slipped 1.3 percent after the home improvement retailer missed sales forecasts as the long winter put a damper on demand for spring products.\nSmaller rival Lowe’s was down 0.9 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.25-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
