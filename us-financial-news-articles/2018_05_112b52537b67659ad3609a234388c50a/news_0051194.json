The rest will come from the Sapinhoa field in the Campos basin and the Lula field in the Santos basin.\nBrazilian rules dictate that companies vying for stakes in the prolific pre-salt must bid by promising a share of oil production to the government. But rules laying out how the government must sell its share took many months to approve.\nReporting by Luciano Costa; Writing by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T02:29:32.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
