The agency said it does not believe the Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot system will be part of the investigation.\nThis investigation is \"primarily focus(ed) on emergency response in relation to the electric vehicle battery fire, including fire department activities and towing operations,\" the agency said.\nA preliminary investigation showed the Tesla drove off the road and hit a concrete wall, immediately catching fire, the Fort Lauderdale Police Department said in a statement. The speed of the vehicle is believed to have been a factor in the crash, the police said.\nTesla Inc did not immediately comment. Shares of the company closed up at $306.85 up 1.6 percent and were off less than 0.5 percent in afterhours trading.\nThe new investigation adds to an already contentious relationship between the company and the agency.\nLast month, Tesla lashed out at the NTSB after it took the unusual step of removing the automaker from the investigation of a fatal crash in March in which a Tesla vehicles driver-assistance Autopilot system was in use.\nThe NTSB defended the decision, saying Tesla released investigative information prematurely and in violation of procedure.\nTesla in return blasted the NTSB, saying the board was \"more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety. It accused the agency of violating its own rules while trying to prevent Tesla from disclosing all the facts.\nThe NTSB is also investigating an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, after an owner lost control and ran the vehicle into his garage and a January crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in Autopilot that struck a fire truck in California.
