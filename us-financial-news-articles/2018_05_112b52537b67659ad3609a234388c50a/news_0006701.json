TWTR 4.52% is exploring the possibility of allowing publishers to take the lead in selling preroll video ads that run at the start of their video clips on the platform, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe ad-sales offering is still being developed and details have yet to be completed, the person said. To date, Twitter has handled the sale of preroll video ads on its platform itself through its Twitter Amplify product.\nGiving publishers additional control over the sale of some ad space could lead to more revenue for publishers, who will now have the ability to pitch marketers on broader ad-sales deals that package commercials before videos on Twitter with advertising on other platforms.\nThe offering wouldn’t change the financial split of ad sales on Twitter, the person said, meaning that publishers will still keep 70% of the revenue from ads that are sold against their content. Twitter takes a 30% cut.\nThe change aims to give publishers greater flexibility in how ads are sold through Amplify. Currently, Amplify automatically matches up publisher video content with Twitter’s inventory of advertising in one of about 15 content categories. Allowing publishers to sell the ads themselves would give them the control and ability to sell Amplify advertising as part of wider-ranging ad-sales packages.\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokeswoman said the company is “always listening to the needs of our partners and exploring turnkey solutions to help publishers grow their business and audiences.”\nTwitter has already allowed select publishers to sell branded content themselves on Twitter featuring specific advertisers, with somewhat more flexible revenue-sharing arrangements. Bloomberg, for example, sells branded content for its Twitter show “TicToc” and keeps upward of 70% of the revenue, according to a person familiar with the matter. BuzzFeed also carries branded content on its morning show, “AM to DM,” which is sold jointly by Twitter and BuzzFeed, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nSeveral media executives said Twitter has stepped up its outreach in recent months, aiming to bolster its relationship with publishers at the same time Facebook Inc. began to adjust its news feed to reduce the amount of news content seen by users. In February, Twitter said publishers generated 60% more revenue through its platform and ad products in 2017.\n“In the last few months, it’s really become meaningful,” said a publishing executive in charge of platform relationships.\nVideo ads now account for more than half of Twitter’s revenue, the company disclosed last week, and Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said he believes video can account for an even greater share of revenue in the future. First-quarter revenue rose 21% to almost $665 million.\nThe experiment comes as Twitter is expanding its slate of shows produced in partnership with media organizations. On Monday, Walt Disney Co. and Twitter said they reached an agreement for Disney brands from ESPN to ABC and Disney Channel to create ad-supported live content for distribution on the platform.\nOther social-media platforms also allow publishers to sell ads directly. Instant Articles, a fast-loading article template inside Facebook, can be monetized by publishers through direct sales or through Facebook’s advertising network. Publishers keep all of the revenue for ads they sell themselves on Instant Articles and receive 70% of revenue from sales made through Facebook’s network. Snap Inc. also allows publishers to sell some advertising formats on its Snapchat messaging platform.", "external_links": ["https://blog.twitter.com/marketing/en_us/topics/product-news/2018/Update-on-Amplify-Publisher-Program-Requirements.html?mod=article_inline"], "published": "2018-05-01T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T04:17:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
