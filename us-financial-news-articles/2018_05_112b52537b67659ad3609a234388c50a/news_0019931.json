If it gives in to the League, it risks becoming an irrelevance in parliament. If it pushes for a re-vote, opinion polls suggest it will cede significant ground to its increasingly buoyant ally.\nPRESIDENTIAL CONCERN An SWG poll released on Tuesday showed the League, which has presented itself as the voice of reason in the political impasse, on 24.2 percent against the 17.4 it took in March, while Forza Italia was on just 9.4 percent from 14 percent.\nThe same survey showed 5-Star and the Democratic Party (PD) broadly unchanged from their election results on around 32 percent and 19 percent respectively.\nPresident Sergio Mattarella, a key player in Italian politics, is eager to avoid an immediate election, fearing it will result in another stalemate and damage the economy.\nHe said on Monday he planned to nominate a “neutral government” to draw up a 2019 budget to stave off the threat of an automatic increase in sales taxes that would be triggered because of missed deficit targets.\nA source in his office said the president would name the new prime minister on Wednesday or Thursday in the hope that parliament will give the nominee the necessary confidence votes to pursue a limited mandate that would expire in December.\nThat looks highly unlikely, with both the League and 5-Star highly hostile to the idea.\n“We are doing everything possible to form a political government and thereby respect the will of the Italians, but if this isn’t possible there can be no neutral government,” Giorgetti said.\nIf parliament rejects the president’s pleas, then the earliest possible date for an election would be July 22, when many Italians will have gone on holiday, meaning turnout could slump.\nItaly traditionally holds its national elections in the spring and the latest it has ever voted was June 26, in 1983.
