Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan speaks during an interview with Reuters at Canary Wharf in London, Britain July 7, 2015. REUTERS/Neil Hall\nRBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan made the pledge on Tuesday in response to questions from lawmakers in London on the bank’s closures in Scotland, where it was established in 1727 and is still headquartered.\nMcEwan said RBS had to respond to the growing use of online banking and fewer people using its branches, but was now “comfortable” with the size of its network in Scotland,\n“Our branches do remain a core part of our service and we will not look at the size of the network again in Scotland until at least 2020,” he told the Scottish Affairs Committee.
