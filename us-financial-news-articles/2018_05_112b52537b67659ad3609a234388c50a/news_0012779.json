(NYSE: CHD):\n2018 First Quarter Results 2018 Full Year Outlook Sales growth +14.7%; Organic +3.8% (volume +4.0%) Reported Sales growth raised to 9% Domestic Sales growth +13.9%; Organic +3.6% International Sales growth +26.3%; Organic +6.8% 10 of 11 Power brands grew or held share EPS growth +24% Organic Sales growth raised to exceed 3% 2018 EPS Outlook: $2.24 to $2.28, +16% to +18% Adjusted Cash from operations expected to exceed $680MM\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE: CHD) today announced first quarter 2018 reported EPS of $0.63, a 24% increase, exceeding the Company’s outlook. First quarter prior year included a $0.01 charge related to the sale of the Brazilian Specialty Products business.\nFirst quarter net sales grew 14.7% to $1,006.0 million. Organic sales grew 3.8% driven by global consumer products growth of 4.2%. Global consumer organic sales were driven by volume growth of 4.7%, partially offset by 0.5% from unfavorable product mix and pricing, which continues to improve.\nMatthew Farrell, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We were pleased to deliver strong Q1 results as momentum from 2017 has continued into early 2018 exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2% organic sales growth and $0.61 EPS. The Consumer Domestic business posted strong volume growth in Q1 as 10 out of 11 power brands met or exceeded category growth. The investments in our international business, particularly export, continue to pay off as evidenced by consistent organic growth. Our 2017 acquisition of Waterpik continues to perform well.”\nFirst Quarter Review\nConsumer Domestic net sales were $751.4 million, a $91.7 million or 13.9% increase driven by recent acquisitions and household and personal care sales growth. Organic sales increased 3.6% due to higher volume (+5.3%) offset by price and product mix (-1.7%). Growth was led by ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, OXICLEAN stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins and TOPPIK and VIVISCAL hair care businesses.\nConsumer International net sales were $180.7 million, a $37.6 million or 26.3% increase driven by recent acquisitions, expansion of our export business, and broad-based household and personal care growth. Organic sales increased 6.8% due to higher volume (+1.6%) and price and product mix (+5.2%). Organic sales were driven primarily by OXICLEAN in the export business, STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico and FEMFRESH and BATISTE in Australia.\nSpecialty Products net sales were $73.9 million, a -$0.5 million or -0.7% decrease. Organic sales decreased -1.0% due to lower volume (-3.8%) offset by commodity pass-through pricing (+2.8%) primarily in the animal productivity business. Demand in the dairy industry is significantly reduced due to low milk prices. Poultry industry demand continues to grow, reducing our dependence on the dairy industry.\nGross margin decreased 60 basis points to 44.9%. Excluding the prior year Brazil charge, adjusted gross margin decreased 80 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by higher commodities and transportation costs.\nMarketing expense was $99.9 million, an increase of $9.1 million or 10.0%. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 9.9% reflecting 2017 acquisitions which have a lower spend rate. Excluding acquisitions, marketing as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points to 10.5%.\nSelling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A) was $131.3 million or 13.1% of net sales, a 30 basis point increase, primarily due to acquisitions, including intangible amortization costs.\nIncome from Operations was $220.3 million or 21.9% of net sales.\nOther Expense was $21.7 million, primarily driven by incremental interest expense on higher debt levels related to recent acquisitions.\nThe effective tax rate was 21.4% compared to 30.9% in 2017. This change was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) enacted in the U.S. in December 2017.\nOperating Cash Flow\nFor the first three months of 2018, net cash from operating activities was $155.5 million, a $24.0 million increase from the prior year due to higher cash earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. Capital expenditures for the first three months were $9.9 million, a $7.1 million increase from the prior year.\nAt March 31, 2018, cash on hand was $119.8 million, while total debt was $2,354.8 million.\n2018 New Products\nMr. Farrell commented, “Innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. In support of our long-term strategy to drive revenue and earnings growth, we have launched new products in several categories. We launched ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL lightweight unscented cat litter with guaranteed 7-day odor control building on the success of our innovative CLUMP & SEAL franchise. We expanded our ODOR BLASTERS laundry platform leveraging technology that helps eliminate tough odors. We introduced new VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS probiotics gummy vitamins supporting digestive health by providing friendly bacteria in a great tasting gummy. WATERPIK launched a water flosser to restore whiteness while flossing. TROJAN has launched NIRVANA, an assortment of sensation condoms celebrating self-expression in an exclusive package design. BATISTE continues to expand distribution with three unique fragrances leveraging its #1 U.S. share position.”\nOutlook for 2018\nMr. Farrell stated, “We now expect sales growth to be 9% and organic sales growth to exceed 3%. We continue to expect EPS of $2.24 to $2.28 or adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 18% (reported decline of 21% to 23% due to 2017 tax law changes) in 2018 which reflects continued strong business performance as stronger volume growth and share gains are expected to offset increasing pressure on gross margin from rising commodity and transportation costs.”\nFor the second quarter, we expect reported sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 3%. We expect EPS to approximate $0.46 per share, a 59% reported increase over last year’s Q2 EPS and a 12% adjusted increase over last year’s Q2 EPS.”\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on May 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. (ET).

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. The following non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures provided by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and items and events being excluded.\nOrganic Sales Growth:\nThis press release provides information regarding organic sales growth, namely net sales growth excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rate changes. Management believes that the presentation of organic sales growth is useful to investors because it enables them to assess, on a consistent basis, sales trends related to products that were marketed by the Company during the entirety of relevant periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions and excluding foreign exchange rate changes that are out of the control of, and do not reflect the performance of, the Company and management.\nAdjusted Gross Margin:\nThis press release provides information regarding adjusted gross margin, namely gross margin excluding the effect of a charge taken in 2017 related to the Brazil Specialty Products business. We believe that excluding this charge from gross margin provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more effective comparison to prior periods by excluding significant one-time events.\nAdjusted Marketing Expense:\nThis press release provides information regarding adjusted marketing expense, namely marketing expense excluding the effect of acquisitions which have a lower spend rate. We believe that excluding this charge from marketing expense provides a more effective comparison to prior periods.\nAdjusted EPS:\nThis press release also presents adjusted EPS, namely, earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to exclude significant one-time items that are not indicative of the Company’s period to period performance. We believe that this metric provides investors a useful perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides useful supplemental information regarding our year over year earnings per share growth. Adjusted 2017 EPS excludes a charge related to the Brazil Specialty Products business, a settlement charge related to the U.K. pension termination, a tax benefit from a joint venture impairment, and a one-time tax benefit to adjust deferred tax accounts and reflect deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nCHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.\nOrganic Sales\nThree Months Ended 3/31/2018 Total Worldwide Consumer Consumer Specialty Company Consumer Domestic International Products Reported Sales Growth 14.7% 16.1% 13.9% 26.3% -0.7% Less: Acquisitions 10.2% 10.5% 10.3% 11.8% 8.1% Add: FX / Other -1.3% -1.4% 0.0% -7.7% 0.0% Divestitures 0.6% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 7.8% Organic Sales Growth 3.8% 4.2% 3.6% 6.8% -1.0% CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data) For the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nFor the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nChange Adjusted Gross Profit and Margin Reconciliation Gross Profit and Margin - Reported $ 451.5 44.9 % $ 399.3 45.5 % (60 ) bps Brazil Charge $ - 0.0 % $ 1.3 0.2 % (20 ) bps Gross Profit and Margin - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 451.5 44.9 % $ 400.6 45.7 % (80 ) bps Adjusted Marketing Expense Reconciliation Marketing Expense - Reported $ 99.9 9.9 % $ 90.8 10.3 % (40 ) bps Acquisitions $ (3.5 ) 0.6 % $ - 0.0 % 60 bps Marketing Expense - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 96.4 10.5 % $ 90.8 10.3 % 20 bps Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation Diluted Earnings Per Share - Reported $ 0.63 $ 0.51 23.5 % Brazil Charge $ - $ 0.01 Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 0.63 $ 0.52 21.2 % CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited)\nReported and Organic Forecasted Sales Reconciliation\nFor the Quarter For the Year Ended Ended June 30, 2018 December 31, 2018 Reported Sales Growth 12% 9% Less: Acquisitions 8% 5% FX / Other 1% 1% Organic Sales Growth 3% 3% For the quarter ended June 30,\n2018\nJune 30,\n2017\nChange Forecasted Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nDiluted Earnings Per Share - Reported $ 0.46 $ 0.29 58.6 % U.K. Pension Termination $ - $ 0.12 Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 0.46 $ 0.41 12.2 % Forecasted Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change Diluted Earnings Per Share - Reported $ 2.24 - 2.28 $ 2.90 -21% to -23% Brazil Charge $ - $ 0.01 U.K. Pension Settlement Charge $ - $ 0.12 Joint Venture Impairment Tax Benefit $ - $ (0.03 ) U.S. TCJA Tax Reform $ - $ (1.06 ) Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 2.24 - 2.28 $ 1.94 16% to 18%\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005541/en/\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc.\nRick Dierker, 609-806-1200\nChief Financial Officer\nSource: Church & Dwight Co., Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.churchdwight.com&esheet=51800417&newsitemid=20180503005541&lan=en-US&anchor=www.churchdwight.com&index=1&md5=6f179cf99ae34c9f3edbc501b0131075", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005541/en/"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:51:11.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
