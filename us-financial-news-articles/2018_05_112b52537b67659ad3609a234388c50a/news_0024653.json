Fans threw stones and lit fires before police managed to contain the trouble.\nA league match between the teams in March was abandoned after a controversial refereeing decision prompted the PAOK President to charge on to the pitch with a handgun in his belt.\nThis led to the suspension of the league for more than two weeks and a warning from world soccer’s governing body FIFA for Greece to reform immediately or risk being handed an international ban.\nPAOK and their President Ivan Savvidis were subsequently also sanctioned and the team had points deducted, ending their title hopes.\nGreece is also facing a potential international ban from FIFA, which will next month discuss the state of football in the country.
