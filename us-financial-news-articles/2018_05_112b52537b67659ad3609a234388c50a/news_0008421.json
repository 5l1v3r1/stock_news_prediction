(NYSE: ALE) today reported first quarter 2018 earnings of 99 cents per share on net income of $51.0 million and operating revenue of $358.2 million. Last year’s results were 97 cents per share on net income of $49.0 million and operating revenue of $365.6 million.\n“Our multifaceted growth strategy is evidenced in our financial results for the quarter, and overall the results are in-line with our expectations; our full-year earnings guidance range and expected contribution ranges from our Regulated Operations segment, and Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses and Corporate and Other operations remain unchanged. ALLETE has delivered on growth initiatives this quarter” said ALLETE Chairman, President and CEO Al Hodnik. “And we are well positioned with ALLETE’s family of businesses to answer the call for cleaner energy forms and water conservation, while creating additional value for our shareholders.”\nALLETE’s Regulated Operations segment, which includes Minnesota Power, Superior Water, Light and Power (SWL&P) and the Company’s investment in the American Transmission Co. (ATC), recorded net income of $43.9 million, compared to $43.5 million in the first quarter a year ago. Earnings reflect lower net income at Minnesota Power resulting from reserves for an interim rate refund, discounts provided to Energy-Intensive Trade-Exposed customers, lower transmission revenue and higher property taxes. These declines were offset by lower depreciation expense due to timing of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s decision to modify the Boswell Units 3 and 4 and common facilities depreciable lives, lower operating and maintenance expense, higher sales to industrial customers due to the start-up of Keewatin Taconite in March 2017, and higher sales to residential customers due to colder weather. Minnesota Power and the Minnesota Department of Commerce separately requested reconsideration on rate case decision points that, if granted, will impact 2018 revenue and expense. Net income at SWL&P increased over last year due to the implementation of new rates effective in August 2017 and higher sales attributable to colder weather, while equity earnings from ATC were similar to last year.\nALLETE’s Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses, which include ALLETE Clean Energy and U.S. Water Services, recorded net income of $8.1 million and a net loss of $1.4 million in 2018, respectively. Earnings at ALLETE Clean Energy increased $1.4 million, or 21 percent, from 2017 primarily due to a lower federal income tax rate and production tax credits generated by its ongoing wind turbine refurbishment strategy. The net loss at U.S. Water Services increased $1.1 million due to higher operating expenses, which were partially offset by increased equipment revenue. Revenue increased 19 percent primarily due to the September 2017 acquisition of Tonka Water; however, revenue was negatively impacted by lower than expected equipment sales due to timing of shipments, as well as colder weather which reduced chemical sales. Earnings at U.S. Water Services reflect results from selling certain products that are seasonal in nature, with higher demand typically realized in warmer months.\nCorporate and Other, which includes BNI Energy and ALLETE Properties, recorded net income of $0.4 million for the quarter, compared to a net loss of $0.9 million in 2017. The increase in 2018 reflects higher land sales at ALLETE Properties and lower interest expense.\nEarnings per share for the quarter was diluted by 2 cents due to additional shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2018.\nALLETE and webcast at 10 a.m. Eastern Time this morning to discuss details of its financial performance.
