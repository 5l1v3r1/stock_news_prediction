He also agreed to delete such information from his private email accounts.\nDannon and Chobani, known for its Greek yogurt, are major brands in the roughly $8.8 billion U.S. yogurt market.\nChobani was not a defendant in the case, whose dismissal was approved by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains.\nThe case is Dannon Co v Muyshondt, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01567.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Diane Craft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
