Cielo has been losing market share to competitors such as Stone Pagamentos SA and PagSeguro Digital Ltd.\nYear-over-year, Cielo’s number of points of sale in stores decreased by around 14 percent. Its net revenue fell 0.6 percent over a year earlier to 2.8 billion reais.\nIn a statement, Cielo said the contraction is due to changes in taxes and also lower rental revenues. Total transaction value with credit and debit, however, increased 6.3 percent in the same period.\n$1 = 3.5515 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:17:35.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
