It has initially formed a system combat capability,” Ren said, without elaborating.\nChina’s second, domestically-developed, carrier, began sea trials earlier in May. It is as yet unnamed.\nChinese military experts have told state media the new carrier, built in the northeastern port of Dalian, is not expected to enter service until 2020, once it has been fully fitted out and armed.\nUnlike the U.S. Navy’s longer-range nuclear carriers, both of China’s feature Soviet-design ski-jump bows, intended to provide sufficient take-off lift for fighter jets. They lack the powerful catapult launch technology that U.S. carriers have.\nState media have Quote: d experts as saying China needs at least six carriers. The United States operates 10 and plans to build two more.\nMost experts agree that developing such a force will be a decades-long task for China, but progress on a home-built carrier boosts prestige for Beijing, seen by many analysts as keen to eventually erode U.S. military prominence in the region.\nRen said he had no details to provide on whether China was building any other carriers.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:34:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
