The failure to sell Supervia was seen by the banks as an example of the delayed assets sale.\nOdebrecht has only received $7 billion of the $12 billion in deals announced, mostly due to legal hurdles to close deals in countries such as Peru. But creditors said this is not the case with Supervia.\nThe United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co PJSC negotiated with Odebrecht through BTG for months, but the conglomerate considered their offer too low.\nSince then, other two groups showed interest in Supervia: Starboard Restructuring Partners and a Brazilian group, RTM Brasil, formed by executives and backed by undisclosed buyout firms willing to finance the deal, two of the people said.\nOdebrecht, BTG Pactual, Bradesco, Itaú, Mubadala and Starboard did not immediately comment on the matter.\nOdebrecht acquired 60 percent of Supervia in 2011. The company operates urban commuter trains in 12 cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro and transports around 750,000 people daily.
