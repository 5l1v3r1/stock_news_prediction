In line with this strategy, Changfeng has taken steps to divest part of its ownership stake (the “Disposal”) in Pingxiang Changfeng Gas Co., Ltd. (“Pingxiang CF”) to free up capital for other investment opportunities. The Disposal was completed on January 5, 2018 thereby recorded a net gain of RMB33.5 million (approximately CAD6.7million) in the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. After completion of the Disposal, the Group’s equity interest in Pingxiang CF reduced to 40% and such interest was re-classified as interest in associates of the Group.\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial results and Management’s Discussion and Analysis can be downloaded from www.SEDAR.com or from the Company's website at www.changfengenergy.com .\nAbout Changfeng Energy Inc.\nChangfeng Energy Inc. is a Canadian public company currently traded on the Toronto Venture Exchange (\"TSX-V\") under the stock symbol \"CFY\".
