An Intel representative declined to comment on the vulnerabilities described in c’t magazine.\nIn a statement on its website, Intel said it routinely works closely with customers, partners, other chipmakers and researchers to mitigate any issues that are identified, and that part of the process involved reserving blocks of CVE numbers.\n“We believe strongly in the value of coordinated disclosure and will share additional details on any potential issues as we finalize mitigations,” the statement said.\nRepresentatives with AMD and ARM could not immediately be reached for comment. Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request to comment.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine, additional reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bangalore.
