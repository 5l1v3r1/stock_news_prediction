Currently, the company is developing two therapies targeting hematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Ublituximab (TG-1101) is a novel, glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a specific and unique epitope on the CD20 antigen found on mature B-lymphocytes. TG Therapeutics is also developing umbralisib (TGR-1202), an orally available PI3K delta inhibitor. The delta isoform of PI3K is strongly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and is believed to be important in the proliferation and survival of B‐lymphocytes. Both ublituximab and umbralisib, or the combination of which is referred to as \"U2\", are in Phase 3 clinical development for patients with hematologic malignancies, with ublituximab also in Phase 3 clinical development for Multiple Sclerosis. Additionally, the Company has recently brought its anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody into Phase 1 development and aims to bring additional pipeline assets into the clinic in the future. TG Therapeutics is headquartered in New York City.\nCONTACT:\nJenna Bosco\nSVP, Corporate Communications\nTG Therapeutics, Inc.\nTelephone: 212.554.4351\nEmail: ir@tgtxinc.com\nSource:TG Therapeutics, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gl5nkxeG-hmHmVCDgdQB6xZBC3DldAbD9po7OLOu3KdMvAQ3rhLfkXGFizsOQvcG6U1qB5cEGLT1xp59AdWjJditIdOAKWEgnV6c-lAR3jkD5N6QG6hK8fuKLNpNAgry", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vsHgMByKR2Vq5ZzSw5GNqkDnTp28_eJxVZf44308L5r8JLaHH3iuzjZESv_9J0gc0B_DWnXzgeH_YpJeQIJfug==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9387e5a2-78e3-4d93-a53a-db047549e589", "http://ir.tgtherapeutics.com/events"], "published": "2018-05-04T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T15:30:21.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
