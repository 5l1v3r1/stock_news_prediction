They have all denied wrongdoing.\nThe new law will enable the chief justice to establish special high courts and appoint three judges to them as needed.\nIn the 225-member parliament 119 lawmakers backed the special court law and 52 voted against. Many legislators were not present at the vote.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T20:03:08.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
