Then, he pointed to Bitcoin futures that Winklevoss-backed cryptocurrency exchange Gemini launched with the Chicago Board Options Exchange: “You can short XBT, the CBOE Bitcoin Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is!”\nDear @BillGates there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT , the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is! cc @CNBC @WarrenBuffett https://t.co/4JIhF5vWsZ\n— Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) May 7, 2018\nThe Winklevoss twin, who gained notoriety for suing Facebook , also mentioned Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, another known Bitcoin skeptic. Buffett said in January that said he expects Bitcoin to come “to a bad ending” because it doesn’t produce anything and is a purely speculative asset. However, Buffett has said that he has no plans to go short on the asset , though he’d be glad to buy a less risky derivative to hedge against a potential fall in Bitcoin.\nThe price of Bitcoin is now around $9,115, down about 3% Tuesday, and down from its all-time high near $20,000 in December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:01:41.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
