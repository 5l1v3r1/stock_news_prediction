Doctors will be presented with clinical data from a pivotal study in this patient group at ATS.\nThe so-called IMPACT study showed GSK’s once-daily Trelegy was superior to other approaches at reducing severe attacks and improving lung function.\n“I think the IMPACT data is going to generate lot of interest and out of that we will see a heightened interest in Trelegy,” Miels said.\nStill, pricing pressure in respiratory medicine remains a black cloud, especially with U.S. generic Advair looming.\nAlthough Advair copycats failed to launch in 2017 as U.S. regulators knocked back applications, they are very possible this year, with Mylan due to hear next month whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve its version.\nTIME WILL TELL The price squeeze in the U.S. inhaler market is proving more severe than GSK had anticipated at the start of the year, particularly in the ICS/LABA area, which includes Advair. Another class known as LAMA medicine is faring better.\nSince Trelegy includes all three products in a single inhaler, it is potentially caught in the cross-fire.\nGSK has priced Trelegy at a 20 percent discount to its components and the company has not reduced the price since its launch, but Miels acknowledged this might change once Advair generics arrive.\n“We are not experiencing direct pressure on Trelegy at this point in time. I think it’s reasonable to think there will be some pressure with the introduction of Advair generics but we’re confident we can manage that,” he said.\nOutside the United States, which is likely to account for around 60 percent of sales, Trelegy has already launched in Britain and is now being rolled out in Germany and Canada.\nConsensus analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters don’t predict it becoming a $1 billion-a-year blockbuster before 2023 but Miels said such estimates looked conservative.\n“We are more confident,” he said. “Time will tell but I hope that over time the analysts will move their numbers up.”\nMiels, who was hired by new CEO Emma Walmsley last year from AstraZeneca, has redeployed resources to focus on such priority products and nearly all of GSK’s more than 2,000 respiratory reps in the United States are now selling Trelegy and Nucala, plus two other relatively new lung drugs Breo and Anoro.\nThat leaves only a small contract team working on Advair.\nGSK will also present long-term data on Nucala - a new kind of biotech drug for severe asthma - at ATS. The medicine has enjoyed a head-start over rivals but now faces competition from AstraZeneca’s Fasenra.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:16:06.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
