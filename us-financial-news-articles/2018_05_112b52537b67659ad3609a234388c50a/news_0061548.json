The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management's determination of the components of non-GAAP and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions, a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable. Any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable.\nSource:Blockchain Power Trust", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3lib0wu7bcn9CNRp0ah_GZn9_XhhcfZMjKqWnxL2P9Jt9z0csj14c_Myl5kSZElTMVM4Kr4EACq-eTdDRSXGpg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3a81f184-e217-42d1-af77-02f1d63006e3", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3lib0wu7bcn9CNRp0ah_GTPaFEukKHu2iqenW41mlgo2FAYRicvIUOdFl7H14cHqrv8lpbCGhneOrnrSnc7a9Q=="], "published": "2018-05-31T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T08:36:13.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
