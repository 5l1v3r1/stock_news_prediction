In conjunction with the acquisition, Astero will receive growth capital investment from BroadOak.\nAstero Bio, founded in 2018 and headquartered in Menlo Park, is spearheaded by former critical members of the MedCision senior management team. With almost a century of combined successful corporate finance, R&D, and commercial experience, Astero has been preparing for commercial launch of several new patent-pending products applicable to the cell therapy industry in addition to those recently acquired via BroadOak. As an early investor in the assets transferred, BroadOak expertly navigated the legal process initiated by the former asset owner’s bankruptcy and extended diligent support to all parties involved. BroadOak recognized the immense value in the technology it initially invested in and remains steadfast in that belief.\nPrimary assets and related intellectual property acquired by Astero include the award-winning ThawSTAR Automated Cell Thawing System , a first-of-its-kind automated instrument created to de-risk thawing of live cell therapeutics. The cell thawing process is vital for preclinical and clinical biologics handling, and is now widely recognized to be one of the most crucial processes in cell therapy. In addition, Astero has acquired the BioT ultra-low temperature cold storage and transport solutions that improve critical logistic steps, manufacturing processes, and near-patient drug management.\nSamuel Kent, Astero’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Astero welcomes the opportunity to bring great technologies, like the ThawSTAR cell thawing system, back to market so that they may reach their full potential in enabling future medicines. Furthermore, Astero is pleased to have had the opportunity to significantly collaborate with BroadOak. We could not ask for a better partner in this transaction and additional financial backing.”\nWilliam Snider, Co-Founder and Partner for BroadOak Capital, commented: “We look forward to supporting Astero’s growth and innovation and are confident that this proven management team will deliver the ThawSTAR and other products back into the market which demands innovative solutions.”\nFor more information about Astero’s products, including the ThawSTAR Cell Thawing Systems and the BioT Solutions product line, please contact Astero CEO Sam Kent: sam@asterobio.com .\nAbout Astero Bio Corporation\nAstero Bio Corporation is a leader in novel tools and technologies for life science research, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and clinical applications.
