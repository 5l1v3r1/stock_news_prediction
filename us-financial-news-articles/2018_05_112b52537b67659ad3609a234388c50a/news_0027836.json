But that drop was short-lived as expectations grew that the Fed would raise interest rates at least three more times this year, pushing U.S. bond yields to fresh highs in early European trade on Wednesday.\nThat sell-off dragged euro zone 10-year bond yields up 1 to 2 basis points, though the move proved short-lived.\nOil prices, meanwhile, rose more than 3 percent at one stage, hitting 3-1/2 year highs after the U.S. quit the Iran deal, adding upward pressure on euro zone bond yields.
