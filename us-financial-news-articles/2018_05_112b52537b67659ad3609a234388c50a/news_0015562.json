(\"ThreeSixty\"), a leading cross-category provider of branded consumer products to the nation's largest retailers.\nOver the past decade, Vornado has grown into the leading manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of premium home comfort products in the U.S. and internationally, primarily under the Vornado brand, across the air circulator, heater, steamer, air purifier and humidifier product categories. Vornado is driven by two key promises that direct the focus and energies of every employee, \"End consumers will experience perfect comfort\" and \"Trade partners will encounter impeccable performance.\" These two promises continue to be the foundation for growth and industry leadership that Vornado has come to embody.\nRandy Brillhart, CEO of Vornado, said, \"When our management team joined Vornado in December 2006, Vornado sales were predominantly comprised of the Company's signature 'air circulator' product line. We recognized the potential of the brand and brought a broader vision to the Vornado brand. Over the past 10 years, we have broadened the product line and have introduced the brand to selected international markets. We believe the future for Vornado is virtually limitless, and we are excited about our partnership with ThreeSixty.\"\nDana Bradford, the controlling shareholder of Vornado, noted, \"The success of Vornado comes down to one thing â€“ people. The management team at Vornado is an exceptional group of people, and it has been an honor to be their partner.\"\nBill Phillips, Chairman of Vornado, added, \"In 2006, we recognized Vornado as an iconic, premium, yet underdeveloped brand that lacked strategic focus and discipline. Through the efforts of all Vornado employees, we were able to unlock the potential of the brand, drive significant growth, and deliver on our promises to our consumers and trade partners.\"\nJohann Clapp, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of ThreeSixty Group, said, \"We are thrilled to be partnering with the Vornado team, who have an impressive track-record of innovation-driven growth and bring highly complementary consumer product development experience to our business.\" Kirk McLean, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, added, \"Vornado represents a highly attractive opportunity for us: the brand stands for quality and innovation within the home comfort category. Bill, Randy and their team have built an incredible business and we are excited about the potential of our partnership together.\"\nSawaya Partners, LLC, a leading consumer investment banking firm, acted as exclusive financial advisor to Vornado.\nAbout Vornado Air, LLC\nVornado was acquired in December 2006 by a partnership formed by Dana Bradford and Bill Phillips.
