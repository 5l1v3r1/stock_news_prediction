They also came third in the United States in 1994.\nCoach:\nSteeped in the traditions of the Swedish game, 55-year-old Janne Andersson took over from Erik Hamren in 2016 and immediately began implementing the kind of team-first policy that helped him to win the Swedish title with an unfancied IFK Norrkoping side in 2015.\nThough his strengths lie in his traditional view of the game, Andersson is an intelligent, forward-thinking leader with a proven ability to get his teams to deliver at a high level.\nKey players:\nEmil Forsberg: The RB Leipzig winger has inherited both the number 10 shirt worn previously by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the responsibility for being the team’s creative spark.\nForsberg is the outlet for many of Sweden’s counter-attacks, and his excellent close control, dribbling and shooting create plenty of opportunities for his team mates.\nRobin Olsen: Tall and commanding, the FC Copenhagen goalkeeper is an excellent shot-stopper and a good performance in Russia will probably see him courted by top clubs in Europe.\nSuperb in the air and confident with his feet, Olsen is the last line of defense as well as the launch-pad for many of Sweden’s attacks.\nAndreas Granqvist: Captain and center-back, Granqvist is the beating heart of the Sweden team and their leader on the pitch.\nNot one to pull out of a tackle or shy away from a duel, he is capable of scoring from set-pieces or from distance with his thunderous right foot.\nForm guide:\nThe high of World Cup qualification has been tempered somewhat by flat friendly performances in recent months, but the Swedes have proved in qualifying that they are capable of turning it on in competitive games.\nHow they qualified:\nSweden finished second in Group A on 19 points, four behind winners France, and edged out the Netherlands on goal difference before beating Italy 1-0 on aggregate in a thrilling two-legged playoff to book their World Cup berth.\nProspects:\nMeticulous in his preparations, Andersson has a habit of getting the results he needs, despite the limited resources at his disposal, and at the very least he and his team will be aiming to get out of the group.\nShould they finish as runners-up to Germany, they will most likely face Brazil in the last 16.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:23:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
