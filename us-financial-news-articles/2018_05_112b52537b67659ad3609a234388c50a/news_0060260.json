REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier Brazilian environmental agency Ibama rejected on Tuesday Total’s application for an environmental license to drill in that area. It is the fourth time that Ibama has rejected the application and requested additional information.\n“The latest observations by Ibama on our exploration project at the mouth of the Amazon are in no way a rejection of this project,” Total said in a statement.\n“Regular discussions are part of the preliminary process when local authorities award the license required to begin any operations. Total will review and respond to the request by Ibama for additional information about the Environmental Impact Study,” added Total.\nReporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:14:49.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
