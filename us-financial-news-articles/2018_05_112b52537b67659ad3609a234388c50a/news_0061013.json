That brief is not a decision in the case.\n“We remain confident that the courts will uphold the view of policymakers and regulators who support the continued operation of Illinois’ nuclear plants and the environmental benefits they provide for consumers,” Exelon said in a statement.\nIn addition to Illinois, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey have also adopted rules to subsidize nuclear power plants. Power generators opposed to the New York rule are challenging it in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nPennsylvania and Ohio are considering similar legislation to keep reactors in their states in service, but analysts have said it is less likely those states will adopt nuclear subsidy rules because the states are major gas producers.
