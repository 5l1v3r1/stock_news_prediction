However, the coalition has struck Syrian pro-government forces that it said were attempting to attack coalition positions.\nThe U.S. military operating outside the coalition also maintains a base at Tanf in the eastern Syrian desert near the borders with Iraq and Jordan and last year struck pro-government forces moving along a road towards it.
