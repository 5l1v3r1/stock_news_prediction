Italy’s two largest parties, the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, came out against the proposal.\nOn Tuesday, the dollar extended recent gains and rose 0.4 percent to 93.08 as markets further unwound short bets against the greenback built up in recent months, pushing the dollar up for three consecutive weeks.\nSome of the dollar’s biggest gains on Tuesday came against the euro and the Australian dollar which declined by 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.\nThe sell-off in these currency pairs rippled through the foreign exchange markets and prompted investors to unwind some of the best performing trades this year.\nThey include buying the Norwegian currency against the Swedish crown, which on Tuesday fell half a percent.\nShort dollar positions saw a further squeeze with latest positioning data keeping the greenback well supported.\nOn a two-weekly basis, short dollar bets saw the biggest position unwind in six months.\n“For the time being there is no possibility of avoiding U.S. dollar, which is also due to the fact that the likelihood of an imminent monetary policy normalisation in other parts of the world is falling,” Commerzbank analysts wrote in a note.\nBut despite the dollar’s rally, the Japanese yen was still holding its own against the greenback and other majors indicating that underlying caution remained.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-05-08T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:51:22.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
