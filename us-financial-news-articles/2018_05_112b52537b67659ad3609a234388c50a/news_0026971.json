It’ll really only matter if it’s translated into action.”\nThe European Union gave asylum to more than half a million refugees in 2017, according to statistics office Eurostat, with Germany taking in more than 60 percent. Most refugees came from war-torn Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.\nGrowing compassion towards refugees could be attributed to a more accepting attitude post-Brexit, as well as the Windrush scandal over Britain’s treatment of Caribbean immigrants, according to the data team behind the index.\nClose to half of those surveyed - 47 percent - said legally established immigrants should be able to become citizens in Britain, up from 37 percent last year.\nAnalysts said it was unsurprising that sentiment appeared to be shifting in favor of refugees, but also warned it could change quite quickly.\nSecurity concerns and the economy were the biggest factors in swaying attitudes, according to Helen Dempster, communications manager at the Overseas Development Institute, which conducted a similar study last year.\n“The problem is, one thing can switch it. What we’ve seen in Germany is that attitudes were very positive until they had one terrorist attack, and then the attitudes massively nose-dived,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nOf the 11,000 people surveyed for the Aurora Humanitarian Index, 58 percent said terrorism remained the world’s biggest humanitarian concern.\nBritain granted asylum to just under 15,000 people in 2017, according to government data.\nReporting by Serena Chaudhry, Editing by Claire Cozens.
