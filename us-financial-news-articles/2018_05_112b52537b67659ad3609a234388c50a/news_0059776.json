REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Under the new policy, U.S. consular officers may limit the time visas are valid, rather than the usual practice of issuing them for the maximum possible period, AP reported.\nThe State Department did not immediately provide comment on the report.\nThe change would come as the administration of President Donald Trump attempts to crack down on what it says is theft of U.S. intellectual property by China.\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that under directions sent to U.S. embassies and consulates, Chinese graduate students would be limited to one-year visas if they are studying in certain fields, such as robotics, aviation and high-tech manufacturing, AP reported.\nThose are areas Beijing has said are high-priority goals for its manufacturing sector.\nThe official said the instructions also stated that Chinese citizens seeking visas would need special clearance from multiple U.S. agencies if they work as researchers or managers for companies on a U.S. Commerce Department list of entities needing higher scrutiny. Those clearances are expected to take months for each application, AP cited the official as saying.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Washington said it was still considering slapping 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods in retaliation for what the Trump administration says are Chinaâ€™s unfair trade practices.\nReporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T04:12:28.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
