Then, bumming around Spain, he acted in a movie that wasn’t released and wrote a novel (“The Great Ice Cream Affair”) that wasn’t published.\nHis parents, German-speaking Jewish immigrants from Europe, made one thing clear when he returned home to New York: Writing might be fine as a sideline, but he needed a day job to pay his bills. He soon made a splash working for paperback publishers in New York. He had dark curly hair, movie-idol looks and a knack for finding big-selling books others had overlooked.\nMore Obituaries\nButch Granville Steered Texaco Through Oil-Market Turmoil in the 1970s May 25, 2018 Jean Otte Helped Women Navigate Corporate Jungle May 25, 2018 Celebrated Novelist Philip Roth Dies May 23, 2018 LSU Heisman Trophy Winner Billy Cannon Dies at 80 May 20, 2018 Koerner Rombauer Produced Buttery Chardonnays That Everyone’s Mom Loved May 18, 2018 Britain’s Penguin Books, then losing money, hired him as CEO in 1978. He reinvigorated Penguin by thrusting it into the mass market with “The Far Pavilions” and other aggressively marketed hits. After retiring from Penguin in 1997, he focused on running two tiny publishers he owned, Overlook Press in New York and Gerald Duckworth & Co. in London.\n“I’m very happy,” he said in a 2015 Web of Stories oral history. “I publish books, and I think I can do that until I drop.” He was still shepherding book projects when he died May 11 of complications from amyloidosis at his home in Manhattan, at age 82.\nHe had no idea what he was in for in 1988 when Penguin’s Viking imprint released Salman Rushdie’s “Satanic Verses.” Islamic scholars found the book blasphemous, setting off riots and book bonfires around the world. Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa, or religious decree, calling on the faithful to kill Mr. Rushdie, who went into hiding. A Japanese translator of the novel was stabbed to death.\nMr. Mayer refused to withdraw the book and said terrorists must not be allowed to decide what can be published. Amid heavy security at Penguin offices, where dogs sniffed incoming mail, he did delay publication of the paperback version, in defiance of Mr. Rushdie’s wishes. Mr. Mayer said he had already made his point by keeping the hardback in circulation and wouldn’t endanger his staff further. “I will now not stick a poker in the eye of the people who are angry about this book,” he recalled thinking. “I’ll let things calm down.”\nPeter Michael Mayer, an only child, was born March 28, 1936, in London. When he was 4, his family resettled in New York, and his father ran a glove-making business.\nAt 16, Peter Mayer jumped from high school to Columbia University. He spent a year abroad at the University of Oxford and earned his Columbia degree four years later.\nHe moonlighted as a New York taxi driver. One snowy night, he picked up the poet Allen Ginsberg and friends on the Lower East Side. They invited him to a party, and around 2 a.m. someone suggested a trip to San Francisco. Mr. Mayer volunteered and began driving them west in his cab. The cab company found out a couple days later. “I got fired somewhere around Kansas City,” Mr. Mayer recalled.\nAfter a stint in the Army, Mr. Mayer got job offers on the same day from the august Alfred A. Knopf publishing house and tiny Orion Press. He chose Orion because he figured he would learn more at a small publisher. “It is better to be in the center of small things than to be on the periphery of big things,” he said later.\nHe moved on to Avon Books and generated huge sales by reviving the Henry Roth novel “Call It Sleep.” In the late 1970s, Penguin recruited him as CEO.\nHe arrived in London in late 1978 during the “Winter of Discontent,” when Britain was hobbled by strikes and sunk in gloom. “Nobody was working very hard in Britain at all,” he said.\nWhen he called meetings, many Penguin editors and managers didn’t show up. He decided to hold all meetings on Mondays and Fridays. “Absenteeism went down unbelievably because it was quite clear who wasn’t there on Mondays and Fridays, who was extending their weekends,” he said.\nEmployees refused to pick up phones for colleagues who were away. “It’s not my job,” they told Mr. Mayer. He began answering phones all over the building. “It started to embarrass people to have the CEO pick up everybody’s phone, and soon they started picking up their own phones or helping their buddies,” he said.\nHis mass-market novels, including racy romances dubbed bonkbusters, horrified old-timers who preferred a more elitist approach. Mr. Mayer explained that Penguin could continue publishing literary novels only if it bumped up profits by putting out popular titles too.\nHe lost passports and other necessities, ignored no-smoking signs and was so worn out by global travels that he sometimes dozed in meetings, but colleagues prized his charm, erudition and passion for literature.\nPeter Mayer in his younger years. Photo: The Overlook Press At his family-owned Overlook Press, he revived “Freddy the Pig” books he remembered from childhood and published everything from literature to Sudoku puzzle books.\nHis marriage to Mary Hall ended in divorce. He is survived by his partner, Sophy Thompson ; his daughter, Liese Mayer; and a granddaughter.\nIn his oral history, Mr. Mayer remembered sitting in a coin laundry as a young man and realizing he feared nothing but terminal illness. If he lost a job, he was sure, he could always find another. “I was liberated,” he said, “and I’ve never been frightened since.”\nWrite to James R.
