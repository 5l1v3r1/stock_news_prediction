For example, at Kamaishi, which we always knew might be the story of the tournament.\n“The two matches that will take place there will be very special and so there is a huge demand for those matches.”\nThe Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium, located in the region ravaged by the 2011 earthquake, is the only stadium being built specifically for this event. It will host its first match in August and two matches during the World Cup.
