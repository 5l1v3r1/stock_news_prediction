The tariffs are aimed primarily at overcapacity among state-backed firms in China that have flooded global markets with cheap steel.\nEuropean leaders have argued that their countries shouldn't be held responsible for China's practices. Visits to the White House by Macron and Merkel last week produced no immediate change in the expiration date.\nMay's office said in a statement after the prime minister's Sunday call with Merkel that they and Macron \"pledged to continue to work closely with the rest of the EU and the U.S. administration with the aim of a permanent exemption from U.S. tariffs.\nIn March, Trump imposed duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The step drew retaliation from China and has led to fears of a wider trade war that could hold back the growth of the global economy.
