At the very least, \"I do think that if negative news about non-farm payrolls comes out, were going to see dollar losses,\" said Michael Diaz, head of foreign exchange at XE in Buena Park, California in reference to the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report that will be released on Friday morning.\nThe euro remained resilient against the dollar, in spite of the trade announcement, maintaining levels set earlier in the day on the news that Italy's anti-establishment political leaders Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio reached a deal to resurrect their proposed coalition government, averting the prospect of a new snap election which had rattled global markets.\nThe rise of a potentially euroskeptic government in Italy and the impact that could have on the stability of Europe had driven the euro to 10-month lows against the dollar on Tuesday.\nThe euro strengthened against the dollar on Thursday, climbing half a percent to a three-day high of $1.1724, after having risen 1.1 percent the previous day, its second-biggest daily gain this year.\nThe dollar shed 0.5 percent to 108.37 yen, edging back toward Tuesday's five-week low of 108.10 yen.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.4 percent to a session low of 93.717.
