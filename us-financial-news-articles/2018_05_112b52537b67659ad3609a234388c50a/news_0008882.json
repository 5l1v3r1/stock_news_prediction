(NYSE:FTSI) (“FTSI,” the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) today reported financial and operational results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Summary\nRevenue was $467.5 million and net income was $78.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. Revenue was up from $458.7 million and net income was down from $92.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $129.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, down from $138.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Annualized adjusted EBITDA per fleet was $18.8 million, down from $21.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower efficiencies caused by weather disruptions. Completed initial public offering on February 6, 2018 with net proceeds of $303 million, which, combined with cash from the business, was used to repay $395 million of debt. Subsequent to March 31, 2018, we utilized cash from the business to repay an additional $50 million of debt.\nOperational Highlights\nOur average active fleets during the first quarter of 2018 was 27.5, up from 26.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017. We ended the first quarter of 2018 with 28 active fleets and four inactive fleets. We currently anticipate reactivating our 29 th fleet in June or July and intend to reactivate one or two additional fleets in the third quarter of 2018.\nWe completed 8,152 stages during the first quarter of 2018, or 296.4 stages per active fleet. Efficiencies were down from the fourth quarter of 2017 due to weather disruptions that were concentrated in the beginning of the first quarter of 2018. However, we achieved efficiencies that progressively improved throughout the quarter and we exited the first quarter with efficiencies that exceeded the third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we continued the construction of two additional fleets, which we expect to complete before the end of the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital expenditures were $37.8 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe net proceeds from our initial public offering, combined with cash from the business, was used to repay $395 million of debt, which reduced the principal amount of debt outstanding to $735 million as of March 31, 2018. In addition, we utilized cash on hand to reduce the balance of our term loan due 2021 by an additional $50 million in April 2018.\nWe ended the first quarter of 2018 with $155.5 million of cash and $171.3 million in availability under our revolving credit facility, which had no borrowings outstanding.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the financial results at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Tuesday, May 1, 2018.

Our services enhance hydrocarbon flow from oil and natural gas wells drilled by exploration and production companies in shale and other unconventional resource formations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as earnings before interest; income taxes; and depreciation and amortization, as well as, the following items, if applicable: gain or loss on disposal of assets; debt extinguishment gains or losses; inventory write-downs, asset and goodwill impairments; gain on insurance recoveries; acquisition earn-out adjustments; stock-based compensation; and acquisition or disposition transaction costs. The most comparable financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA under GAAP is net income or loss. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate the operating performance of our business for comparable periods and it is a metric used for management incentive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or others as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions, as it excludes a number of important items. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of operating performance because it excludes the effects of our capital structure and certain non-cash items from our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors in the oilfield services industry to measure a company's operating performance, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other industry peer companies.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
