REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\nThe deal, flagged to Reuters by sources who declined to be named on Sunday, is the biggest done by Chief Executive John Flannery since he announced a major overhaul of the U.S. industrial conglomerate late last year.\nGE will receive a $2.9 billion up-front payment in cash and its shareholders will own 50.1 percent of the combined company, while Wabtec shareholders will own the rest, the companies said in a statement.\nWabtec chief executive Raymond T. Betler will remain president and CEO of the merged company while its Chairman, Albert J. Neupaver has been re-appointed executive chairman. GE Transportation Chief Executive Rafael Santana will become president and CEO of Wabtec’s Freight Segment.\nThe resulting company will have approximately $8 billion in revenues, the companies said.\nThe transaction is expected to close in early 2019.\nFlannery told GE shareholders earlier this year he would be looking aggressively at spin-offs and other ways to maximize the value of GE’s power, aviation and healthcare units.\nBased on Wabtec’s stock price on April 19, 2018, the last unaffected trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction, the value of the transaction is approximately $11.1 billion, the companies said.\nWhen adjusted for the net tax step-up value of $1.1 billion accruing to the combined company, the transaction value is $10 billion. The transaction is expected to be tax free to the companies’ respective shareholders.\nGE shares were up 2.1 percent at $15.30 Wabtec shares rose 1.4 percent to $96.51.
