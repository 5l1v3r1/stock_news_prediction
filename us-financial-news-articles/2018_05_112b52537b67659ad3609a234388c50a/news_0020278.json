Gross sales for the 2018 first quarter increased 17.2 percent to $990.6 million from $845.5 million in the same period last year. Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”), based on sales to certain of the Company’s customers which TCCC accounts for under the equity method (the “TCCC Related Parties”), or consolidates, are included as a reduction to net sales. Prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to the TCCC Related Parties were included in operating expenses. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net and gross sales for the 2018 first quarter of $17.7 million and $22.2 million, respectively.\nNet sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Hydro® energy drinks and Mutant® Super Soda drinks, increased 16.7 percent to $780.5 million for the 2018 first quarter, from $668.6 million for the same period last year. Net sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $3.9 million, due to the adoption of ASC 606. Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, decreased 3.3 percent to $65.8 million for the 2018 first quarter, from $68.0 million in the comparable 2017 quarter. Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $6.0 million, due to the adoption of ASC 606. Net sales for the Company’s Other segment, which includes certain products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, were $4.7 million for the 2018 first quarter, compared with $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter.\nNet sales to customers outside the United States increased 26.8 percent to $242.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, from $190.9 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017.\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 first quarter was 60.6 percent, compared with 64.8 percent in the 2017 first quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; (ii) the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; (iii) geographical sales mix; (iv) domestic product sales mix; and (v) certain increases in other costs.\nOperating expenses for the 2018 first quarter were $235.3 million, compared with $216.6 million in the 2017 first quarter. Operating expenses included distributor termination expenses of $7.0 million for the 2018 first quarter, compared with $19.9 million in the 2017 first quarter. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, commissions included in operating expenses decreased.\nThe impact to net sales, gross profit and operating expenses from the adoption of ASC 606 is included in the table below.\nDistribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9 percent for the 2018 first quarter, compared with 3.1 percent in the first quarter last year.\nSelling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 first quarter were 11.5 percent, compared with 11.7 percent in the first quarter last year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 2018 first quarter were $104.8 million, or 12.3 percent of net sales, compared with $107.1 million, or 14.4 percent of net sales, for the comparable 2017 first quarter. Stock-based compensation (a non-cash item) was $13.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $13.1 million in the first quarter last year.\nOperating income for the 2018 first quarter increased to $279.9 million from $264.3 million in the comparable 2017 quarter.\nThe effective tax rate for the 2018 first quarter was 23.3 percent, compared with 32.8 percent in the same period last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nNet income for the 2018 first quarter increased 21.4 percent to $216.1 million from $178.0 million in the comparable quarter last year. Net income per diluted share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1 percent to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. The Company estimates that distributor termination expenses in the 2018 first quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.01 per share, after tax.\nDuring 2018 first quarter, the Company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share, for a total amount of $249.9 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted availability under the repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in February 2017. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new $250.0 million share repurchase program. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the new repurchase program.\nThe following table illustrates the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 for the 2018 first quarter as described above (in thousands):\nThree-Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018, as\nReported Percent\nChange\n2018 vs\n2017 Three-Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018, Without the\nAdoption of ASC\n606 Percent\nChange\n2018 vs\n2017 Net Sales by Segment: Monster Energy® Drinks $ 780,505 16.7 % $ 784,388 17.3 % Strategic Brands 65,759 (3.3 %) 71,816 5.6 % Other 4,657 (15.9 %) 4,657 (15.9 %) Total Net Sales 850,921 14.7 % 860,861 16.0 % Cost of Sales 335,664 28.5 % 335,664 28.5 % Gross Profit $ 515,257 7.2 % $ 525,197 9.2 % Gross Profit as a percentage of net sales 60.6 % 61.0 % Operating Expenses $ 235,342 8.6 % $ 245,282 13.2 % Rodney C.

The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the disclosure of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“ GAAP ”) and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this announcement may constitute “ ” the U.S. federal securities laws , as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to our future operating results and other future events including revenues and profitability.
