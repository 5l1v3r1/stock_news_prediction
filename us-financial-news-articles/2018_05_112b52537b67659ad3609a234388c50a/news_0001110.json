In return, Djibouti would have the option of taking stakes in state-owned Ethiopian firms.\n“A joint committee of ministers would meet to thrash out details,” Ethiopian New Agency said.\nThe government had previously said that the port would remain “in the hands of our country” until it found new investors.\nDjibouti handles roughly 95 percent of all inbound trade for landlocked Ethiopia, Africa’s second most-populous nation and an economic power in East Africa.\nThe deal with Djibouti follows Ethiopia’s agreement to acquire a 19 percent stake in the Port of Berbera in the breakaway Somali region of Somaliland. DP World retains a 51 percent stake there, while the government holds the rest.\nEthiopian state companies that Djibouti may look to invest in following the bilateral agreement could include Ethiopian Electric Power and Ethio Telecom – one of Africa’s last remaining telecoms monopolies.
