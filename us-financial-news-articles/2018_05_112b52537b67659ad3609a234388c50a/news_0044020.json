Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell shares at an agreed price on a future date.\nNasdaq Dubai said it will offer future contracts on Saudi companies, which are some of the region’s largest businesses active in sectors such as petrochemicals, real estate, banking and transport.\nNasdaq Dubai began trading single-stock futures for shares in some of the United Arab Emirates’ biggest companies in late 2016.
