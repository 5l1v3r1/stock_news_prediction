This represents our 9 th consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth despite competitive new capacity being added to the market.\nWe continue to drive each and every segment of our business with a particular focus on yielding our resorts. GEG's renowned 'World Class, Asian Heart' service combined with our differentiated resorts offerings have delivered memorable customer experiences and resulted in our portfolio of hotels reporting virtually 100% occupancy.\nOur balance sheet remains one of the strongest in global gaming with cash and liquid investments of $41.8 billion and net cash of $34.5 billion. Our strong balance sheet combined with substantial cash flow from operations allows us to return capital to shareholders through dividends and to fund our development pipeline and international expansion plans. These include Cotai Phases 3 & 4, Hengqin, Japan and the Philippines. On 28 February 2018 we announced another special dividend, which was paid on 27 April 2018. The dividend was $0.41 per share which was a 58% increase compared to the previous April dividend.\nThe first quarter was a very productive one for GEG in terms of our development initiatives. In March 2018, we announced our plans to develop a premium quality, eco-friendly beach resort in Boracay, Philippines. We support President Duterte's and the Philippine Government's initiative to clean-up and restore the pristine isle of Boracay.\nIn March 2018, we also announced a passive minority equity investment in Wynn Resorts, Limited (\"Wynn Resorts\") which we closed in early April 2018.\nWe continue to actively pursue Japan and subsequently announced that we enhanced and will continue to expand our team in Japan with the appointment of Mr. Ted Chan as Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\") - Japan Development.\nGEG is embarking on its next growth program with the construction of its Cotai Phases 3 & 4, which will include 4,500 hotel rooms, including family and premium high end rooms, significant MICE space, a 16,000-seat arena, F&B, retail and casinos, among others. GEG has the largest and the most well-defined development growth pipeline of any Macau concessionaire.\nWe are committed to continue to support the Macau Government's vision to develop Macau into a World Centre of Tourism and Leisure as demonstrated by GEG's Cotai Phases 3 & 4 and our planned development in Hengqin. Additionally, the Group supports the Central Government's Greater Bay Area integration program, as well as leveraging on the Belt & Road initiative by our proposed beach front resort development in the Philippine island of Boracay.\nThe continued growth in the rapidly emerging and underpenetrated middle-class in the Mainland and their demand for leisure and travel gives us great confidence in the longer term outlook for Macau. Additionally, the recent opening of new capacity in Macau and the soon to be launched Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge should further stimulate growth in visitations.\nLast but not least, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all of our committed team members who deliver 'World Class, Asian Heart' service every day and contribute to the success of the Group.\"\nMacau Market Overview\nThe positive momentum of 2017 has continued into 2018, supported by a solid economic performance in China and strong outbound tourism.

GEG is also planning to develop a world class leisure and recreation destination resort on a 2.7 square kilometer land parcel on Hengqin adjacent to Macau. This resort will complement GEG's offerings in Macau, and at the same time differentiate it from its peers while supporting Macau in its vision of becoming a World Centre of Tourism and Leisure.\nIn July 2015, GEG made a strategic investment in Société Anonyme des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers à Monaco (\"Monte-Carlo SBM\"), a world renowned owner and operator of iconic luxury hotels and resorts in the Principality of Monaco. GEG continues to explore a range of international development opportunities with Monte-Carlo SBM including Japan.\nGEG is committed to delivering world class unique experiences to its guests and building a sustainable future for the communities in which it operates.\nFor more information about the Group, please visit www.galaxyentertainment.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galaxy-entertainment-group-announces-selected-unaudited-q1-2018-financial-data-300641989.html\nSOURCE Galaxy Entertainment Group", "external_links": ["http://www.galaxyentertainment.com/", "http://photos.prnasia.com/fileman/static_file/do_view?permalink=20180503/2123242-1-b", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galaxy-entertainment-group-announces-selected-unaudited-q1-2018-financial-data-300641989.html", "https://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20180503/2123242-1-b"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:40:14.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
