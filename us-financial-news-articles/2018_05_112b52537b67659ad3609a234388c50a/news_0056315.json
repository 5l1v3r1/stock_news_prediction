The new plan has not yet been publicized by Pandora but was first reported by Android Police on Sunday.\nPandora promises “on-demand music” as part of the family plan, as well as access to the company’s personalized radio, without ads and with unlimited skips and replays. A free 60-day trial of the Pandora Premium Family plan can be had for those wary of taking the plunge.\nSpotify’s Premium for Family plan, which was initially unveiled in 2014 , also allows for six family members to access Spotify Premium for $14.99/month and requires that all members reside in the same household. Apple Music also allows for up to six family members to join under its Apple Music Family plan, for — you guessed it — $14.99/month.
