The last time the institute’s PMI index was below 50 was August 2016.\nApril’s marginally lower PMI reading “was mainly attributed to a slower growth in new orders and new exports, and a slightly slower factory output,” the institute said in a statement.\nThe PMI for the electronics sector was 52.2 in April, down from 52.4 the previous month.\nIn March, Singapore’s annual manufacturing output growth slowed from February. Growth in electronics output is expected to moderate this year.\nReporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:23:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
