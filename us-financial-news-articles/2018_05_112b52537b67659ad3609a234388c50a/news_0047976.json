The Woodlands is home to more than 1,900 companies, including some of the country's largest corporations, and ranks as one of the nation's fastest growing large cities. With a growing population and extensive corporate campuses that employ over 58,000 professionals, The Woodlands provides RBT with access to a highly skilled labor pool to support future growth.\nDr. Robert Smith, CEO of RiceBran Technologies, commented, \"We look forward to calling The Woodlands the new home of our corporate headquarters. The Woodlands will position RBT much closer to the Delta, the major rice growing region of the U.S., the main source of our rice bran supply, and the biggest regional opportunity for our future growth. This will provide greater access and efficiencies to our senior management team as well as key people in operations and logistics, accounting and finance, and customer service. The Woodlands area of greater Houston has an exceptional labor pool that is attracted to our business and industry, and we have already made many hires here to staff our new office. We look forward to building a growing presence in this region as RBT expands its operations, revenues, and pushes towards profitability in order to maximize value for the benefit of our shareholders.\"\nAbout RiceBran Technologies\nRiceBran Technologies is a specialty ingredient company servicing the food, animal nutrition, and specialty ingredient products markets.
