REUTERS/Peter Powell Never-say-die West Bromwich Albion kept their hopes alive of pulling off one of the great escapes with a last-gasp 1-0 win over top-four aristocrats Tottenham Hotspur.\nWest Brom took their unbeaten run under caretaker manager Darren Moore to five matches with a stoppage-time winner from Jake Livermore, although their celebrations could be quickly cut short as they will go down if Southampton win the late game at Everton.\nWith two more teams for the drop to the Championship, Swansea City remained in a parlous position one point above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth and they too would be plunged into the bottom three if Southampton earn a point.\nWest Brom jumped on to 31 points, leapfrogging doomed Stoke on 30, with both sides having one game left in the final week.\nSouthampton have 32 points, with three games to play, while Swansea have 33 with two games left, including a home match against Southampton on Tuesday.\nStoke’s faint hopes were briefly revived in the early kickoff as Xherdan Shaqiri’s deflected free kick just before halftime put them ahead against Palace.\nSoccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City vs Crystal Palace - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - May 5, 2018 Stoke City's Erik Pieters looks dejected after the match as they are relegated from the Premier League.

It will regroup and it’s got the right infra-structure in place to do it.”\nAlbion’s revival is beggaring belief. Their relegation after weeks of defying the prophets of doom-mongers seemed assured as the game against Spurs went into added time but Livermore forced the ball over the line from close range in a manic finish.\nBoth Bournemouth, who beat Swansea with a Ryan Fraser goal, and Crystal Palace ensured their safety for another season and West Ham United look set to join them after a deserved 2-0 victory at Leicester City.\nSoccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Tottenham Hotspur - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - May 5, 2018 West Bromwich Albion's Jake Livermore celebrates scoring their first goal with Chris Brunt.
