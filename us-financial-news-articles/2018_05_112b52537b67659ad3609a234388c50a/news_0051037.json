There will be competition among themselves - that is the core idea,” he told Reuters.\nAbdurahim said eight firms have so far signed up to provide the services, which include different internet packages. Foreign companies were not allowed to provide services, he said.\nEthiopia is one of few African countries to still have a state monopoly in telecoms. The companies that signed agreements with Ethio Telecom have either just been established to sign up for this new business or they were previously doing other business.\nAddis Ababa has ruled out liberalising the telecoms sector, saying the revenue it generates was being spent on infrastructure projects such as railways.\nAbdurahim said the decision to allow private companies to sell services was not a precursor to fully liberalising the sector.\n“This has nothing to do with that. They will be providing downstream services,” he said, referring to data sent from an existing network service provider.\nWhile Ethio Telecom has consistently increased annual revenue, vast parts of the country - including the capital - still suffer from occasionally patchy mobile reception and internet service.\nThe low internet penetration and poor quality of service in Ethiopia is often a drag on businesses and is especially seen as an obstacle to technology start-ups such as those that have thrived in neighbouring Kenya.\nEthiopia maintains a tight grip on several other industries, with foreign firms also barred from the banking and retail sectors.\n$1 = 27.2497 birr Editing by Elias Biryabarema and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:49:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
