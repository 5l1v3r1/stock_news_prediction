That was the key point of the season.”\nGuardiola has ruled out making wholesale changes to the squad in the transfer window but said he would like to add “one or two more players” to offer more tactical solutions on the pitch.\n“Maybe some are not happy, they want to play more and can ask to leave, but not too many,” he added.\n“We made a high investment last year because it was an old team – 10, 11 players more than 31 years old. Now we are going to change some details with Yaya (Toure) leaving, but not too many. One, maybe two (signings).”\nThe Spaniard confirmed he wants forwards Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling to stay at the club.\n“Last season, I said maybe 1,000 times that Sergio will stay until he decides his time is over,” Guardiola said.\nThe club are keen to hand Sterling a new long-term contract after his most successful season in the league in which has found the net 23 times in all competitions.\n“The club, chairman and myself want him to stay a long time, renew his contract — but we are going on holiday in a few days,” said Guardiola.\n“We all want him to stay as long as possible.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:07:45.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
