The Company completed the acquisition and integration of Sprint subscribers related to the additional Sprint territory under the affiliate agreement on February 1, 2018. The 2018 financial results include the impact of the new revenue recognition standard and Tax Reform.\nEarnings per Share was $0.10 in the first quarter 2018 compared to $0.05 in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, earnings in the first quarter 2018 were $0.09 per share.\nTotal revenues were $151.7 million, a decrease of 1.4% compared to first quarter 2017 revenues of $153.9 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which became effective January 1, 2018, total revenues improved approximately $2.0 million. The adoption of the new revenue standard now requires the Company to report costs such as commissions for the national sales channel that are settled separately with Sprint as reductions of revenue. Previously these costs were recorded in cost of goods and services and in selling, general and administrative expense.\nTotal operating expenses were $137.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $143.2 million in the prior year period, a decrease of $5.8 million or 4.1%. Excluding the impacts of the new revenue standard, operating expenses decreased $1.4 million due to a decrease in acquisition and integration costs related to the nTelos integration, and a decrease in depreciation and amortization as assets acquired in the nTelos acquisition were retired. These declines were partially offset by increases in network and selling costs associated with the continued expansion of our networks to support the increase and demand of our subscriber base.\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased 6.6% to $68.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $73.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Continuing OIBDA (Adjusted OIBDA less the benefit received from the waived Sprint management fee) decreased 7.7% to $59.6 million from $64.6 million. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard did not have an impact on Adjusted OIBDA.\nPresident and CEO Christopher E. French commented, “We’re pleased to have continued our momentum from the fourth quarter, delivering enhanced net profitability as well as revenue improvement in two of our segments. The early completion of our transition of nTelos to the Sprint affiliate model resulted in a significant reduction in operating expenses for the quarter and our upgraded network and service packages position us well as a leading telecommunications provider in all of the markets in our extended coverage area.”\nWireless\nFirst quarter wireless revenue decreased $5.1 million or 4.4%, due primarily to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Excluding the impacts of the new revenue recognition standard, revenues decreased $0.9 million driven by a decline in average revenue per subscriber offset by an increase in the number of Sprint's subscribers, including the acquisition of the new territory on February 1, 2018. The decline in average revenue per subscriber was driven by promotions and discounts.\nFirst quarter operating expenses decreased $10.8 million or 10.1%. Excluding the impacts of the new revenue recognition standard, operating expenses decreased $6.3 million. The decrease was due to the elimination of acquisition and integration costs related to the nTelos integration and a reduction in depreciation and amortization. These decreases were offset by increases in network costs resulting from the completion of our 4G roll-out and expanded coverage, as well as additional selling costs.\nShentel served 774,861 wireless postpaid customers at March 31, 2018, up 8.0% over March 31, 2017. First quarter postpaid churn was 1.9% and flat to the preceding quarter. The Company had net additions of 38,264 postpaid customers in the quarter, including 38,434 postpaid subscribers in the acquired territory. As of March 31, 2018, tablets and data devices were 8% of the postpaid base reflecting a net gain of 187 for these devices in the quarter.\nShentel served 250,191 prepaid wireless customers at March 31, 2018, an increase of 35 thousand compared to the first quarter of last year. Total first quarter prepaid churn was 4.4%, down from 5.0% in Q1 2017. The Company had net additions of 24,369 prepaid customers in the first quarter of 2018, including 15,691 prepaid subscribers in the acquired territory. Excluding the impact of the acquired territory, prepaid subscribers grew 3.7%.\nFirst quarter 2018 Adjusted OIBDA in Wireless was $57.6 million, a decrease of 6.3% from the first quarter of 2017. Continuing OIBDA in Wireless was $48.5 million, down 7.6% from the first quarter of 2017.\nMr. French continued, “We have significantly grown our coverage area through both the nTelos acquisition and the recent expansion of our Sprint relationship which added 1.1 million POPs in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, central and southwestern Virginia, southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky. With the addition of these new markets, we’ve focused our marketing efforts on increasing customer awareness around our state-of-the-art network, extended coverage area and enhanced service offerings. We have expanded into complementary markets where we can build networks designed to improve the customer experience by bridging coverage between our existing service areas and Sprint’s metro networks while also providing more continuous, reliable service. We believe the benefits of our upgraded network and expanded market coverage will drive continued customer additions and market share growth.”\nCable\nService revenues in Cable increased $2.1 million or 7.8% to $28.5 million, primarily due to growth in High Speed Data and Voice RGUs, video rate increases implemented in January 2018 to pass through programming cost increases, and new and existing customers selecting higher speed data packages. Operating expenses increased 1.2% or $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter the Company added 1,223 High Speed Data users and 188 voice users, and lost 1,058 video users. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which includes the deferral of incremental commissions and installation costs, was immaterial to operating income for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nAdjusted OIBDA in Cable for first quarter 2018 was $11.7 million, up 26.2% from $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n“Consumers increasingly demand high speed, availability, and reliability when they select a new cable provider or look to upgrade their existing service, and our robust network meets and exceeds these requirements. Our ability to provide both high speed bandwidth and dependability is a competitive advantage that allows us to attract new customers and to seamlessly meet the changing needs of our existing customers,” Mr. French stated.\nWireline\nRevenue in Wireline increased 2.9% to $19.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Carrier access and fiber revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.9 million, an increase of 1.5% from the same quarter last year, primarily as a result of new fiber contracts. Increases in broadband service revenue offset the loss of regulated voice service revenue. Operating expenses increased 6.1% or $0.9 million to $14.9 million for first quarter 2018, primarily due to costs to support new fiber contracts. The impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which includes the deferral of incremental commissions and installation costs, was immaterial to operating income for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nAdjusted OIBDA in Wireline for first quarter 2018 was $8.1 million, as compared to $8.4 million in first quarter 2017.\nOther Information\nCapital expenditures were $24.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $38.6 million in the comparable 2017 period. The Company has spent or committed $47.7 million of the estimated 2018 capital budget.\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were $49.4 million, compared to $78.6 million at December 31, 2017. During the quarter, the Company funded the expansion of the Sprint territory with $52 million of cash on hand. Outstanding debt at March 31, 2018 totaled $810.9 million, net of unamortized loan costs, compared to $822.0 million as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018 no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit.\nConference Call and Webcast\nTeleconference Information:\nDate: May 3, 2018\nTime: 10:00 A.M.

Under Topic 606, these amounts represent consideration payable to our customer, Sprint, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue. In 2017, these amounts were approximately $44.8 million for the national commissions, previously recorded in selling, general and administrative, $18.7 million for national device costs previously recorded in cost of goods and services, and $16.9 million for the on-going service to Sprint's prepaid customers, previously recorded in selling, general and administrative.\n2) Costs incurred by the Company for the sale of devices under Sprint’s device financing and lease programs were previously recorded net against revenue. Under Topic 606, the revenue from device sales is recorded gross as equipment revenue and the device costs are recorded gross and reclassified to cost of goods and services. These amounts were approximately $63.8 million in 2017.\n3) Amounts payable to Sprint for the reimbursement of costs incurred by Sprint in their national sales channel for commissions and device costs, which historically have been expensed when incurred, are deferred and amortized against revenue over the expected period of benefit of approximately 21 to 24 months. In Cable and Wireline, installation revenues are recognized over a shorter period of benefit. The deferred balance as of March 31, 2018 is approximately $52.9 million and is classified on the balance sheet as current and non-current assets, as applicable.\nThe following table identifies the impact that the application of Topic 606 had on the Company's Wireless operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\n($ in thousands) Topic 606 Impact - Wireless Prior to\nAdoption of\nTopic 606 Changes in\nPresentation\n(1) Equipment\nRevenue (2) Deferred\nCosts (3) 3/31/2018\nAs reported Service revenues and other $ 112,683 $ (20,014 ) $ — $ 355 $ 93,024 Equipment revenues 1,854 — 15,520 — 17,374 Total operating revenues 114,537 (20,014 ) 15,520 355 110,398 Cost of services 33,750 — — — 33,750 Cost of goods sold 6,040 (5,833 ) 15,520 — 15,727 Selling, general & administrative 26,316 (14,181 ) — — 12,135 Depreciation and amortization 33,925 — — — 33,925 Total operating expenses 100,031 (20,014 ) 15,520 — 95,537 Operating income 14,506 — — 355 14,861\n1) Amounts payable to Sprint for the reimbursement of costs incurred by Sprint in their national sales channel for commissions and device costs, and to provide on-going support to their prepaid customers in our territory were historically recorded as expense when incurred.

Continuing OIBDA is defined as Adjusted OIBDA, less the benefit received from the waived management fee by Sprint. Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance.\nIn a capital-intensive industry such as telecommunications, management believes that Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA and the associated percentage margin calculations are meaningful measures of our operating performance. We use Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA as supplemental performance measures because management believes these measures facilitate comparisons of our operating performance from period to period and comparisons of our operating performance to that of our peers and other companies by excluding potential differences caused by the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expenses) as well as the other items described above for which additional adjustments were made. In the future, management expects that the Company may again report Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA excluding these items and may incur expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these and other similar items from our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\nWhile depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under generally accepted accounting principles, these expenses primarily represent the current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods, and accordingly may obscure underlying operating trends for some purposes. By isolating the effects of these expenses and other items that vary from period to period without any correlation to our underlying performance, or that vary widely among similar companies, management believes Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance, which are used by management for business planning purposes, and also facilitates comparisons of our performance relative to that of our competitors. In addition, we believe that Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA and similar measures are widely used by investors and financial analysts as measures of our financial performance over time, and to compare our financial performance with that of other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. These limitations include the following:\nthey do not reflect capital expenditures; many of the assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; they do not reflect costs associated with share-based awards exchanged for employee services; they do not reflect interest expense necessary to service interest or principal payments on indebtedness; they do not reflect gains, losses or dividends on investments; they do not reflect expenses incurred for the payment of income taxes; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn light of these limitations, management considers Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA as financial performance measures that supplement but do not replace the information reflected in our GAAP results.\nThe following tables reconcile Adjusted OIBDA and Continuing OIBDA to operating income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\n(in thousands) Wireless Cable Wireline Other Consolidated Operating income $ 14,861 $ 5,527 $ 4,772 $ (10,812 ) $ 14,348 Deferral of

Homes passed is an estimate based upon the best available information.\n2) Customer relationships represent the number of billed customers who receive at least one of our services.\n3) Generally, a dwelling or commercial unit with one or more television sets connected to our distribution system counts as one video customer. Where services are provided on a bulk basis, such as to hotels and some multi-dwelling units, the revenue charged to the customer is divided by the rate for comparable service in the local market to determine the number of customer equivalents included in the customer counts shown above.\n4) Penetration is calculated by dividing the number of users by the number of homes passed or available homes, as appropriate.\n5) Digital video penetration is calculated by dividing the number of digital video users by total video users. Digital video users are video customers who receive any level of video service via digital transmission. A dwelling with one or more digital set-top boxes or digital adapters counts as one digital video user.\n6) Homes and businesses are considered available (“available homes”) if we can connect them to our distribution system without further extending the transmission lines and if we offer the service in that area.\n7) Revenue generating units are the sum of video, voice and high-speed internet users.\n8) Total Fiber Miles are measured by taking the number of fiber strands in a cable and multiplying that number by the route distance. For example, a 10 mile route with 144 fiber strands would equal 1,440 fiber miles.\nThe following table shows selected operating statistics for Wireline as of the dates shown:\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Telephone Access Lines 17,765 17,933 18,160 18,443 Long Distance Subscribers 8,980 9,078 9,134 9,149 Video Customers (1) 4,912 5,019 5,201 5,264 DSL and Cable Modem Subscribers (2) 14,695 14,665 14,527 14,314 Fiber Route Miles 2,078 2,073 1,997 1,971 Total Fiber Miles (3) 155,188 154,165 145,060 142,230", "external_links": ["http://investor.shentel.com/"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:55:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
