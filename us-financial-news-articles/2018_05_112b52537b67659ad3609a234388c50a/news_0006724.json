I love F1 and I believe that we can grow the sport through digital engagement.”\nFrank Arthofer, Formula One’s Director of Digital and New Business, said Twitter had approached the sport’s commercial rights holders with an interest in co-producing original live content.\n“Given how well their platform caters to driving conversation around global live events, the strategic fit was perfect,” he said.\nWalt Disney Co and Twitter announced earlier that they will create live sports, news and entertainment programming specifically for Twitter’s social media platform.
