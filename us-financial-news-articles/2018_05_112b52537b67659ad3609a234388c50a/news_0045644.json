This will create takeover opportunities.\nTakeovers “are absolutely a theme which belong to our program,” Gorissen told a press conference. “We have such a strong financial base that we are one of the companies which can afford to do this in this difficult phase both inside and outside Europe, and it is our plan to do this.”\nNordzucker expects a significant fall in earnings in its new financial year that started on March 1 and is “focusing on avoiding a loss”, Gorissen said.\n“The transition into the (EU’s) liberalized sugar market is stamped with hard competition and a massive price fall,” Gorissen said in a statement on the non-listed company’s financial results.\n“A new balance will have to be found in the market. The way forward to this will involve a market shake-out in the EU.”\nWhite sugar futures fell to their lowest in over nine years in April as a global supply glut weighed on prices.\nNordzucker reported a 3 percent rise in sales to 1.65 billion euros ($1.93 billion) in its 2017/18 financial year to the end of February 2018. Net profit rose to 118 million euros from 99 million euros in the previous year.\nBut the fall in sugar prices in the final quarter had a negative impact on results, it said.\nThe sharp fall in sugar prices means exports are currently not profitable but expanding them remains a goal, Gorissen, who took over as CEO in March this year, told a press conference presenting the company’s results.\nNordzucker has a strong capital base and plans international expansion, he added\n“The EU will remain the core market for Nordzucker,” Gorissen said. “The capital base gives us security and opens possibilities to use the tense market phase to secure and expand market share.”\nHe added: “We will develop step by step into a globally operating company. We will focus on exports and on production locations in other parts of the world.”\nBritish sweeteners and food ingredients company Tate & Lyle said on Thursday it was stepping up efforts to accelerate profit growth to counter a tough food and drink market.\nReporting by Michael Hogan; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:08:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
