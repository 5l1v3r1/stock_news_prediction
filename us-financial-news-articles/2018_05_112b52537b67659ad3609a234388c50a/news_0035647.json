It was down 12.6 percent at 431.6 pence by 0841 GMT and has now fallen 21 percent this year.\n“Volumes in the new build housing market continue to be robust and Crest Nicholson remains well positioned to grow volumes and deliver the homes that the UK needs,” CEO Bergin said in the company’s statement.\nCrest, which operates in London, southern and eastern England and south Wales, said average selling prices of its properties rose 5 percent to 439,000 pounds in the first half of its current fiscal year and this level is expected to represent a peak for the business.\nThe company is due to announce half-year results on June 12.
