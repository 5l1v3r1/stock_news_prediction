It was carved out beneath the government complex in Jerusalem and includes living quarters as well as command facilities.\nReports of the move come amid a rise in tensions with Iran.\nIsrael this month accused Iran of firing rockets from Syria into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel struck back with its heaviest air strikes in Syria since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011.\nMeetings of the Council, hitherto mostly at the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem, are already generally held out of the public eye.\n“Cabinet ministers have told us that one of the main reasons for the move is Netanyahu’s wish to try even harder to prevent leaks and because of fears of spying attempts by hostile foreign parties,” Israel’s Channel 10 said.\nThe group of 11 ministers has already held a small number of meetings at the facility, and three planned weekly sessions, the next of which is scheduled for Wednesday, will be held in the bunker, a media source said.\nIsraeli officials declined to comment on the reports.\nWriting by Ori Lewis; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:43:19.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
