REUTERS/Jon Woo/Files The investigation into a form of steel used in construction was launched following a complaint by EU steelmaker group Eurofer and could bring fresh measures against Chinese steel, increasing tensions between Beijing and Brussels.\nThe European Union already has 17 sets of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place on various grades of steel.\nBrussels has tended to say sectoral problems are chiefly the result of overcapacity, particularly in China. China’s Commerce Ministry said a global economic downturn was the root cause of difficulties for the steel industry.\n“Recklessly adopting trade restrictions will not help to solve the problem,” said Wang Hejun, the head of the ministry’s trade remedy and investigation bureau, adding they would also harm EU steel users.\nThe Journal said the complaint was lodged on behalf of three manufacturers making all of the product in the EU, later listing them as ArcelorMittal subsidiaries in Luxembourg and Poland and Vitkovice Steel of the Czech Republic.\nThe complaint says exports from China have increased significantly at prices that are artificially low.\nCorrugated sheet piling is a steel segment used in construction, which represents 35 percent of total steel consumption. It is principally used for building foundations or retaining walls.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels, Tom Daly in Beijing; Editing by Alastair Macdonald and Gareth Jones/Adrian Croft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
