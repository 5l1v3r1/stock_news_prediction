Its regulatory solvency ratio - an indicator of financial strength - rose 3 percentage points to 211 percent.\nEurope’s No. 3 insurer, present in more than 60 countries, is looking to sell businesses in about a dozen countries to shrink its global business and shore up capital.\nLast month it agreed to sell its Belgian operations for 540 million euros, taking overall proceeds from sales above a target of 1 billion euros.\n“The (disposals) process is not yet finished,” Lubelli said in a call on results.\nOperating profit in the first three months rose 4.9 percent to 1.25 billion euros, beating expectations.\nThe combined ratio - a measure of profitability in non-life business - improved to 91.4 percent despite the impact of 76 million euros in catastrophe claims due to storms in Germany and France.\nItalian broker Banca Akros said it expected a positive impact from the results, mainly thanks to Generali’s better operating profit, its “best in class” combined ratio, an improvement in life margins and a solid capital position.\nGenerali shares were up 1 percent in early trade while the European insurance index was up 0.3 percent. $1 = 0.8344 euros Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T10:16:36.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
