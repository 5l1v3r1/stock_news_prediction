The products offer some principal protection and a chance to book high returns.\n($1 = 6.3737 Chinese yuan) Reporting by Shu Zhang in Beijing, Li Zheng and John Ruwitch in Shanghai; Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:57:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
