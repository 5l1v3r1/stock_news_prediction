For the first time ever, a rare premium domain name in the multi-billion-dollar education sector is available for private sale.\n“Dissertations.com” was registered by the current owner through Network Solutions* in 1997 to support a long-established business serving the secondary education market. This “Top Ten” Google-ranked** domain has been content-driven from day one – establishing the business as a market leader. Brannan’s has entered into an exclusive broker agreement to make the Dissertations.com premium domain available for confidential private sale.\n“Dissertations.com has built substantial branding and search value over the years,” said David Clements, CEO of Brannan’s. “Domain names like this don’t come along very often. It’s a remarkable opportunity for a graduate school, online university, research publication, or student services provider to build their brand and grow their business quickly.”\nThere are many Top-Level Domains (TLDs). But as the original business TLD, .COM domains are the most valuable. The .COM domains comprised of a single word are easier to remember, and therefore have exceptional branding and marketing power. These rare “premium domains” remain in high demand for business and investment. As more business is done online and on mobile devices, the value of premium domains is expected to continue to rise.\n“This is a great success story,” Clements continued. “The original owner is retiring, but the value of Dissertations.com will continue. We are excited and proud to be the trusted broker partner for this important transaction.”\nInterested parties should contact Brannan’s via their website .\nAbout Brannans.com\nDomain Names are the most valuable business assets of the internet age – serving as both virtual real estate and corporate brand. Brannan’s is one of the world’s leading brokers of premium domains and internet-based businesses. Brannan’s has more than a decade of experience helping owners capture the value of their digital assets and enterprise organizations locate and acquire the domain properties that maximize their brand.
