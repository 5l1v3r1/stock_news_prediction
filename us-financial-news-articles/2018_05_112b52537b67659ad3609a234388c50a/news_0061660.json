The investigation focuses on possible breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws.\nOn May 10, 2018, after the market closed, the Company filed with the SEC a Form 8-K disclosing that its Audit Committee hired independent advisers to investigate \"concerns raised by a former employee.\" SYMC further disclosed that as a result of the ongoing investigation, it was \"unlikely [] for the Company to file its annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended March 30, 2018 in a timely manner.\" On that news, SYMC shares nose-dived, trading for as low as $18.85, or nearly 36% less than the previous day's trading high of $29.20. Additionally, according to FactSet, at least 15 analysts cut their SYMC price targets, with one analyst predicting that the investigation may result in further restatement from the Company.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether SYMC's Board breached its fiduciary duties to the Company by failing to ensure that an adequate system of internal controls was maintained over the Company's operations and public reporting.
