Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nThe Canary Wharf financial district in London is shown in November 2017. Reuters\nGood morning. An attempt by the man who runs Barclays PLC to unmask a whistleblower will cost him the equivalent of $1.5 million in penalties and foregone pay, The Journal’s Max Colchester reports . U.K. regulators found Friday that Chief Executive Jes Staley made a “serious error of judgement,” in trying to identify the author of a letter criticizing a hire Barclays made. The report ends a year-long probe.\nBoards need to be aware they have to pay attention to the risk of C-suite misconduct, said Scott Killingsworth, a compliance attorney. “Nobody else controls the C-suite,” he said. “The board has got to do it; it’s a nondelegable duty. Those are the people that avoid all other controls, they don’t report to anybody.”\nThe Barclays case likely won’t lead to legal changes in whistleblower protections but it still will make a difference, Mr. Killingsworth said. “A lot of people have read these headlines and seen what can happen to you if try to interfere in the whistleblower process,” he said. “This is consciousness-raising.”\nBarclays conducted an internal review of its systems after the whistleblowing affair became public, said a person familiar with the matter. That resulted in additional training for staff and changes in procedure to keep letters from whistleblowers from being shared among multiple executives, as happened in the Staley matter, the person said.\nBarclays’s board said it was pleased U.K. regulators have finished investigating; Mr. Staley said it was inappropriate for him to have been personally involved in the matter. A probe by New York state’s financial-services regulator continues.\nOther companies should take action as well, said Shiva Rajgopal, an accounting professor at the Columbia Business School who looks at areas such as corporate governance, culture, bank boards and whistleblowers. “Boards need to go back and check” how such issues are handled, he said. “Boards need to order an audit looking at what is the process of dealing with whistleblower complaints.”\nA proper audit would look at what channels are available to whistleblowers, whether enough complaints are coming in and who deals with issues raised, Mr. Rajgopal said.\nIt would make sure a third party, such as a board committee, provides a cross-check on how allegations are handled. Ideally, a company would consider reporting data to regulators, either confidentially or publicly, on how its complaints system is functioning, he said.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nRussia remains key sanctions risk.
