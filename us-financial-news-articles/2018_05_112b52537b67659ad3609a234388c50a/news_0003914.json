We are just beginning to reap the benefits from our position as an industry leader in delivering content over-the-top while others are just entering this business. Beyond direct-to-consumer, our Company-wide growth in paying subscribers is an extremely important and unique part of our success. Specifically, when you combine our CBS and Showtime subs across traditional MVPDs, virtual MVPDs (aka \"skinny bundles\"), and direct-to-consumer services, CBS Corporation's subscribers are not only growing, but the growth is also accelerating. And the average rate per sub is increasing strongly as well. Looking ahead, we are confident that the demand for our programming will only increase when we unveil our new primetime lineup for the CBS Television Network later this month. In addition, we have a very successful slate of new and returning series at Showtime that continues to drive its rates and subscribers, and we have the midterm elections this fall. All of this is leading to another record year for the CBS Corporation in 2018, and with today's terrific results, we are even more confident in the very strong full-year growth outlook that we laid out three months ago.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 13% to $3.76 billion from $3.34 billion for the same prior-year period, with growth across all of the Company's significant revenue streams. Affiliate and subscription fee revenues were up 16%, led by 25% higher retransmission revenues and fees from CBS Television Network affiliated stations as well as growth from digital initiatives, including the Company's owned streaming subscription services. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up 18%, benefiting from growth from the international licensing of new series as well as the start of renewal periods for licenses of library programming. Advertising revenues increased 8%, which includes the Company's acquisition of Network Ten in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018, which included merger and acquisition-related costs of $9 million, increased 6% to $772 million from $726 million for the same prior-year period. Adjusted operating income increased 8% to $781 million from $726 million, reflecting the revenue growth, which was partially offset by a higher investment in programming and digital initiatives.\nNet earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 increased 13% to $511 million from $454 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted net earnings increased 17% to $518 million from $441 million. These increases are mainly a result of the higher operating income.\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 increased 21% to $1.32 from $1.09 for the same quarter in 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 26% to $1.34 from $1.06, benefiting from growth in net earnings as well as lower weighted average shares outstanding. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 3.8 million of its shares for $200 million.\nDetails of the discrete items excluded from financial results and reconciliations of adjusted results to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included at the end of this earnings release.\nCash Flow\nFor the first quarter of 2018, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $717 million compared with $678 million for the first quarter of 2017.

Changes from these standards include the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs on the statement of operations; the recognition of revenue from the renewal of license agreements at the beginning of the license periods rather than upon execution of such agreements; and the presentation of revenues from the distribution of third-party content at the gross amount received from the customer, with a corresponding increase to operating expenses.

The Company defines \"Adjusted Operating Income\" as operating income excluding merger and acquisition-related costs, where applicable. For each individual reportable segment Adjusted Operating Income is also known as \"Segment Operating Income.\" The Company presents Segment Operating Income as the primary measure of profit and loss for its reportable segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") guidance for segment reporting.\nThe Company uses Adjusted Operating Income (or Segment Operating Income for each segment), as well as Adjusted Operating Income Margin, to, among other things, evaluate the Company's operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of the Company's operational strength and business performance. The Company believes these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, help improve investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance, and make it easier for investors to compare the Company's results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. In addition, these are among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and for the comparison of the Company's operating performance to other companies in its industry, and to compare the Company's year-over-year results.\nBecause Adjusted Operating Income is a measure of performance not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income or net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. As Adjusted Operating Income excludes certain financial information that is included in operating income and net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded. The Company provides the following reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to operating income and net earnings (loss).\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$\n781\n$\n726\nMerger and acquisition-related costs\n(9)\nâ€”\nOperating income\n772\n726\nInterest expense\n(118)\n(109)\nInterest income\n17\n13\nOther items, net\n(11)\n(21)\nEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes\n660\n609\nProvision for income taxes\n(135)\n(138)\nEquity in loss of investee companies, net of tax\n(14)\n(17)\nNet earnings from continuing operations\n511\n454\nNet loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nâ€”\n(706)\nNet earnings (loss)\n$\n511\n$\n(252)\nCBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)\n(Unaudited; in millions)\nFree Cash Flow\nThe Company defines free cash flow as its net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and discretionary contributions to prefund the Company's pension plans, and less capital expenditures. The Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company's operations. Free cash flow excludes discretionary contributions to prefund the Company's pension plans because management assesses the Company's ability to generate operating cash flows without considering the impact from discretionary pension contributions, and decisions regarding the timing of pension plan funding are not dependent on the level of operating cash flows generated during the period. The Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nManagement believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company's operating performance to other companies in its industry.\nAs free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.
