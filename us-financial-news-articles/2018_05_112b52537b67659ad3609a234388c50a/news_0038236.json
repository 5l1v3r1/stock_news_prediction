He spoke on a conference call with investors and analysts a day after the company posted better-than-expected earnings.\nAn intense drought in Argentina earlier this year and below-average rains currently in Brazil have boosted prices for soybeans and corn, elevating costs mainly for pork and poultry processors who use the grains as the main ingredients for feed.\n“On grain costs, I do not see much cooling ahead,” Tomazoni said. The executive said prices might come down a little, between 7 percent and 10 percent, but not more than that.\nA large part of Brazil’s main corn crop is currently in the growing stage, so it could still recover if gets enough rain.\nCorn prices locally are trading at a premium compared to Chicago values, as high exports and strong demand from meat processors lead to expectations of a possible tight supply in the second half.\nJBS reported that sales fell 5 percent in its Seara division, which produces and processes poultry and pork both for the local market and for export. The company had raised prices on those products to offset higher production costs.\nTomazoni said the company will not enter any price war to gain market share.\nJBS shares were up 2.2 percent in Sao Paulo, while the broader exchange index Bovespa was down 0.3 percent.
