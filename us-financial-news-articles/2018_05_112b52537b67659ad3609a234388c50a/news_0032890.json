Two weeks earlier, they averaged 4.80 percent, which was the highest since September 2013, MBA said.\nThe share of refinancing requests of total applications shrank to 35.9 percent, marking its smallest level since August 2008 and less than 36.3 percent the prior week.\nMBA’s seasonally adjusted index on applications to buy a home, which is seen as proxy on future home sales, fell 2.1 percent to 252.4 last week.\nOn Tuesday, the National Association of Home Builders said its barometer of its members’ sentiment rose to 70 points in May from a revised 68 in April.\nThe MBA’s measure on overall mortgage application activity after adjustments for seasonal factors decreased 2.7 percent to 376.5 in the week ended May 11, the lowest since the week of Feb. 16.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:43:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
