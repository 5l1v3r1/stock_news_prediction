Under the repurchase program, the Company may, but is not obligated to, repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that the Company complies with the prohibitions under its Insider Trading Policies and the requirements under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. Repurchases will also be conducted in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Unless extended by the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company expects the repurchase program to remain in place until the earlier of May 8, 2019 and the repurchase of $30 million of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase program because it believes that market volatility may cause the Company’s common stock to be undervalued from time to time. The timing and number of additional shares to be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions and alternative investment opportunities. There can be no assurance that the repurchase program will enhance shareholder value or increase the market value of the Company's shares of common stock. The Company's Board of Directors may amend this program, solely in its discretion, at any time during the duration of the program. Any amendment to the Company's announced repurchase program will be publicly disclosed. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will engage in repurchases, but if market conditions warrant, the Company now has the ability to take advantage of situations where the Company’s management believes share repurchases would be advantageous to the Company and to its stockholders.\nABOUT PENNANTPARK INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nPennantPark Investment Corporation is a business development company which principally invests in U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments.
