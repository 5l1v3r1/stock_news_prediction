Wages, in turn, are often seen as a prelude to higher prices throughout the economy as people spend more as their paychecks grow.\nRising inflation, which threatens Treasury prices because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments, puts upward pressure on rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:49:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
