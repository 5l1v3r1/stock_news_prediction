Reuters/Eric Vidal\nMeasures could include retaliatory sanctions, allowing the European Investment Bank to invest in Iran and coordinating euro-denominated credit lines from European governments.\nYet given the reach of the U.S. financial system, the dominance of the dollar and the presence of European companies’ operations in the United States, there is broad recognition behind the scenes that, despite its clout as the world’s largest trading bloc, Europe will struggle to face down the US.\n“Let’s not fool ourselves that there are dozens of things we can do,” said a senior European diplomat. “We don’t have much to threaten the Americans.”\nIt may be frustration with the way coalition talks are going with 5-Star, but Italy’s far-right League has upped its rhetoric against Europe, saying it was ready, Trump-style, to put Italians first and to wage war on EU budget rules.\nThat came as a draft emerged of the programme the two parties are working on, and which includes a demand that the ECB forgive around 250 billion euros worth of Italian debt - effectively slashing around 10 percentage points off Italy's debt/GDP ratio of 130 percent.\nThe two parties insist the draft is an old one which has since been modified, but the fact that such deliberations exist at all is likely to cause concern in Brussels and at the ECB.\nThe British government said last night it will publish detailed plans for its future relationship with the European Union before the June 28-29 EU summit.

Some media reports suggest, however, it will not go into detail on how it will guarantee there is no physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - a potential deal-breaker.\nThe opposition Labour Party will today try to force PM Theresa May to publish the precise details of the two options currently being discussed by her divided cabinet for future EU customs arrangements. MARKETS AT 0655 GMT\nAnother day, another dollar. And what a dollar.\nAfter its rampage on Tuesday, when its index hit its highest level since last December, the greenback is flat today.\nBut it has trampled everything in its wake after retail sales data confirmed expectations the Fed would stay the course with its rate rises , and oil prices almost touched $80.

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/Illustration\nThe victims are emerging markets, equities and bond markets.\nThe inflation fears sent US yields surging to the highest in almost seven years. All three US stock market indexes fell more than 0.5 percent . Two Fed presidents, from San Francisco and Dallas, reinforced the message that the Fed would go in June for sure and interest rate futures imply a 50 percent chance of three more rate rises this year.\nThis morning things are quieter, with US yields, oil and the dollar a touch off yesterday’s highs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T12:30:10.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
