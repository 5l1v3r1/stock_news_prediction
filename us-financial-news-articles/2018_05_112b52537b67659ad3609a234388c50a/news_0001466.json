Bergstrom is a testament to Bank’s commitment to community and financial strength\nRESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today John Marshall Bank welcomed Christopher “Chris” W. Bergstrom as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. Mr. Bergstrom held a variety of executive positions during his 19 years with Cardinal Financial and Cardinal Bank, serving as President and Chief Executive Officer before United Bank’s acquisition of Cardinal Bank in April 2017. Bergstrom was United Bank’s President for the past year before joining John Marshall Bank.\nJohn R. Maxwell, who previously was John Marshall Bank’s Chairman and CEO and will now serve as the Executive Chairman of the Board, said “To say I am delighted to have someone of Chris’s talent assume the critical position of CEO is an understatement. Chris’s banking experience of nearly 36 years, much of which has been executive leadership, coupled with his reputation as a man of integrity and his success helping to grow Cardinal Bank makes Chris the perfect leader to step into the role as CEO at John Marshall Bank.”\nJohn Marshall Bancorp, Inc. (OTCQB: JMSB) reported total assets of $1.23 billion during the first quarter of 2018 ending March 31st. Year-over-year asset growth, from March 31, 2017, to March 31, 2018, was $151.3 million, or an increase of 14%.\n\"I am excited about taking the reins as CEO of this tremendous community bank,” said Bergstrom. “In a short time span of 10 years, John Marshall Bank has grown its assets from $48 million to $1.23 billion organically, during a time when many of the other local community banks have grown through mergers and acquisitions. John Marshall Bank is one of the few remaining original community banks in the Northern Virginia D.C. metro market and a force with which to be reckoned. It's going to be an exciting time for our customers and employees.\"\n“The Washington Metropolitan area is one of the best financial services markets in the United States,” Bergstrom said. “Recent local bank consolidations present a significant opportunity for John Marshall Bank to distinguish itself from larger institutions.\n“I have spent most of my banking career serving the diverse communities in the Washington, D.C. area. I know what they want from a bank, and I am delighted to play a part in the next stage of John Marshall Bank’s growth as we continue to meet the needs of those we serve,” continued Bergstrom.\n“John Marshall Bank represents the best of community banking. The company has caring and talented professionals and offers the latest technology in its products and services. We are committed to serving the community and are accessible and loyal to our customers. Also, with the bank’s tremendous growth and capital position, we have the muscle to work with larger banking relationships,” Bergstrom concluded.\nBergstrom’s decision to join as CEO is seen as a demonstration of John Marshall Bank’s strength and commitment to its investors and the communities it serves. The company has banking centers in Reston, Alexandria, Arlington, Leesburg, Rockville, Washington, D.C., and a seventh Tysons Corner branch scheduled to open late summer. The Bank is headquartered in Reston.\nJohn Marshall Bank first opened to the public in Falls Church, Virginia in May 2006. Since that time, the bank has become one of the areas most respected, fastest growing and well-capitalized banks.\nPlease visit http://www.johnmarshallbank.com\nFor more information or to schedule an interview with a John Marshall Bank spokesperson, please contact Bruce Gemmill of John Marshall Bank at 703-584-0870 or bgemmill@johnmarshallbank.com\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006263/en/\nJohn Marshall Bank\nBruce Gemmill, 703-584-0870\nbgemmill@johnmarshallbank.com\nSource: John Marshall Bank", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006263/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnmarshallbank.com&esheet=51799945&newsitemid=20180502006263&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnmarshallbank.com&index=1&md5=e64dc973891488a1f70a6af33d8ce6bb"], "published": "2018-05-02T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T00:27:26.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
