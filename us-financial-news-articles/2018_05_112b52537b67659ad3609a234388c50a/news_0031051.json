The protagonists of “Cold War” are named after his late parents.\n“There are a lot of things in common between this couple and my parents,” he said.\n“They were kind of a disastrous couple who fell in love, separated, fell in love again, married other people, got together again, changed countries, fell apart, came together again and so on.\n“It’s not their portrait but there are quite similar mechanics to their relationship.”\nCritics praised the film’s black and white cinematography, musical score and sense of humour, with IndieWire comparing Joanna Kulig’s performance as Zula to a young Jeanne Moreau: “an alcoholic hellcat who thrusts herself into the embraces of other men – quite literally, in a reckless spree around the dance-floor of a rock’n’roll club.
