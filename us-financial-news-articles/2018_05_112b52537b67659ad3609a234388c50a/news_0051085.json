It could result in a jump in late mortgage payments due to confusion among homeowners because of the change in their interest rate resets.\n“We could see a spike in delinquencies because customers don’t know what have been done,” said Dan Sullivan, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nSullivan spoke on a panel about LIBOR at the MBA National Secondary Mortgage Market Conference on Tuesday.\nRegulators set LIBOR to be phased out in 2021 and have encouraged alternatives to take its place.\nThe New York Federal Reserve, together with the Office of Financial Research, a government agency, developed the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) as a LIBOR alternative.\nOne of SOFR’s shortcomings, critics say, is that it is not a measure of what banks charge each other to borrow dollars, which LIBOR does.\n“It’s a great index but it’s a risk-free rate. There’s a mismatch there,” said Stephen Kudenholt, co-chair of capital markets at Dentons US LLP.\nSOFR is derived from daily trades in the repurchase agreement market where traders use their Treasuries holdings as collateral to obtain overnight cash.\nLIBOR is based on a survey of banks on what they charge each other for dollars.\nThis main difference makes it tough for end users such mortgage lenders and servicers to set prices on loans and related products, according to the panelists.\nMoreover, the absence of a vibrant futures market for SOFR makes it tough for traders and lenders to extrapolate a longer-term rate to hedge their interest rate risks, they added.\nAfter SOFR’s launch in April, futures contracts tied to it began trading earlier this month, albeit with low daily volumes.\nDan Fichtler, a MBA director of housing finance policy, said there are concerns about the costs for the industry to overhaul its computer and accounting systems and processes to accommodate the change from LIBOR.\nMortgage servicers also face the burden of notifying and explaining to borrowers about the reference change to their mortgage rates when their floating-rate loans reset in 2021, the panelists said.\nAl Qureshi, managing director of analytics at Incenter said he prefers more tweaks to LIBOR rather than abandoning it for an imperfect alternative.\n“It’s an apple-and-orange question,” Qureshi said of choosing between the two rate benchmarks.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Daniel Bases\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:20:34.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
