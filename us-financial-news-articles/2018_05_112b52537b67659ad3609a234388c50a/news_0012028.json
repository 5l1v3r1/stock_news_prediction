Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 9% to $36.8 million, compared to $33.8 million for the same period in 2017. TechXtend segment net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased 13% to $3.7 million, compared to $4.3 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in TechXtend sales was primarily driven by a decrease in extended payment term sales.\nAdjusted gross billings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 11% or $12.3 million to $125.1 million compared to $112.8 million for the same period last year (see attached table for a discussion of adjusted gross billings).\nGross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 2% to $6.9 million compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 6% to $6.1 million, compared to $5.8 million in the same period in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased 23% to $0.7 million, compared to $0.9 million in 2017 due to lower extended payment term sales.\nGross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 17.0%, compared to 17.7% for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 16.8%, compared to 17.3% for the same period in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter March 31, 2018 decreased 2.4 percentage points to 19.1%, compared to 21.5% for the same period in 2017.\nTotal selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased slightly to $5.0 million, primarily due to higher professional fees and public company related costs, when compared to the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.4% in 2018 compared to 13.0% in 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.5 million compared to $0.6 in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 23.4 % in 2018 compared to 32.0% in the prior year due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 21% to $1.6 million compared to $1.3 million during the prior year.\nDiluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 23% to $0.36, compared to $0.29 for the same period in 2017.\nOn May 2, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable May 21, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 14, 2018.\nAdjustments to historical results upon retrospective adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective adoption method. Under the full retrospective adoption method, the Company presents revenue for current and comparative periods on an adjusted basis, reflecting the new accounting standard. The most significant impact of adopting the standard relates to the recognition of revenue for Software - security and highly interdependent with support and Third-party maintenance support and other services, net of the related cost of sales. Historically the Company has accounted for most sales on a gross basis, with third party costs included in cost of sales.\nThe change from gross sale to net reporting has no impact on gross profit, net income or cash flows, though it increases gross profit as a percentage of sales. The adoption of the standard resulted in a reduction of net sales as previously reported or adjusted gross billings (see attached table), and a corresponding reduction of cost of sales of $84.5 million, and $74.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The attached tables present the expected impact of the adoption on historical results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as if the standard had been adopted in the earliest period presented. Additional information will be available in the Company’s quarterly report filed on Form 10Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Wayside Technology Group, Inc.\nWayside Technology Group, Inc.

We provided a reconciliation of Adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. We use Adjusted gross billings of product and services as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into the volume of business generated by our business, and to analyze the changes to our accounts receivable and accounts payable. Our use of Adjusted gross billings of product and services as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThe table below presents basic and diluted earnings per share as previously reported and as restated (see note 3).\nThree months ended March 31, 2017 As Previously Reported: Income per common share - Basic $ 0.30 Income per common share - Diluted $ 0.30 Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic 4,343 Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted 4,359 As Restated: Income per common share - Basic $ 0.29 Income per common share - Diluted $ 0.29 Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic 4,343 Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted 4,343 (3) Earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were recalculated and restated using the two-class method, to be presented on a comparable basis with the same periods in 2018. In 2017, the Company determined it should be reporting earnings per share using the two-class method, which treats unvested restricted shares granted under our 2012 Stock-Based Compensation Plan that are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividends as participating securities. The change had an immaterial impact on previously reported earnings per share (and no net income impact), however, the amounts presented in these tables have been re-stated to correct the error in prior periods for comparability purposes.\nSource:Wayside Technology Group, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/cc9389e9-b3a1-4e3d-9a32-8508cf7f1d0c", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=17FvuGikLz6jI08s4nV37GgDe8nA_h80xwQL-x6UnLTcWHY44OjOJrmg7eLeOSRoxSL7egTWD_k_5aWmzHNFZqOyERKZNZnjJtHnXXzwJs9AZ2DPHEc3sDm3DUyMU2Xi3930EHf0Tl293DCBupFEpzAU7Dx4EFXmGGBagK-mPsE="], "published": "2018-05-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:44:10.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
