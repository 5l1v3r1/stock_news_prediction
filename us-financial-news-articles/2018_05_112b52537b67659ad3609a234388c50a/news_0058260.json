I wish I had an answer,” Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter said to reporters. “It’s another sad day.”\nThe suspect in Friday’s shooting had excused himself from class and came back armed with the pistols and opened fire in a science class, authorities said. Police apprehended him in the classroom.\nA police guard at the school responded to the shooting, and other law enforcement officers arrived within minutes, police said in a statement.\nThe wounded teacher was identified as Jason Seaman, 29. The unidentified girl was in critical condition at an Indianapolis hospital, police said.\nSeaman’s mother, Kristi Seaman, said on Facebook that he was shot through the abdomen, in the hip and in the forearm and was doing well after surgery.
