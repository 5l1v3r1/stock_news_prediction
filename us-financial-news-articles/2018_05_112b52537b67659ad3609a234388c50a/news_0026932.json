Take a bow, Rishabh Pant.”\nPant, who was involved in two run-outs, hit seven sixes and 15 boundaries in his scintillating knock but was naturally dejected at his team’s failure to reach the playoffs.\n“After the run outs, I took the responsibility and tried to do better for me and my team. I don’t know if it’s my best knock but till now it’s one of my best,” he said.
