GAAP net income of $21.7 million, or $0.52 per basic and diluted share. Core earnings plus drop income of $14.1 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share. 1,2 Economic return on book value was 4.8% 1,3 for the quarter. 1.90% annualized net interest margin on our investment portfolio. 1,4 7.7x leverage excluding securitized debt as of March 31, 2018 (10.5x leverage with securitized debt).

Drop income was $1.0 million or $0.02 per share for the three months\n3\nEconomic return is calculated by taking the sum of: (i) the total dividends declared; and (ii) the change in book value during the period and dividing by the beginning book value.\n4\nIncludes interest-only securities accounted for as derivatives, total return swap and the cost of interest rate swaps.\n5\nExcludes $1.3 billion in a securitized commercial loan of a consolidated variable interest entity.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n\"I am very pleased to report that we delivered an economic return on book value of 4.8% during the first quarter, driven by core earnings plus drop income of $0.34 per share, an increase of 9.7% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in our book value of 2.0%,\" said Jennifer Murphy, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"The significant repositioning of the asset composition of our portfolio that occurred over the course of 2017 and has continued in the first quarter contributed to our strong results, particularly as the fixed income markets have experienced increased volatility. Our first quarter dividend remained stable at $0.31 per share for the eighth quarter in a row, which reflects our commitment to our long-term goal of generating attractive total returns for our shareholders, while also providing for greater book value stability.\"\nAnup Agarwal, Chief Investment Officer of the Company, commented, \"Our solid performance for the quarter is a continuation of our portfolio repositioning into credit sensitive investments, as well as taking steps to improve the portfolio's interest rate risk profile by both lowering the duration and decreasing the convexity risk. During the quarter, we acquired $486 million of target assets, including $404 million of credit sensitive investments. These purchases occurred across a number of sub-sectors of the mortgage market, supporting our goal of holding a diversified portfolio of securities that offer what we believe to be the best risk-adjusted returns over our investment horizon.\"\n\"Based on current market conditions and our outlook, we will continue to proactively manage our portfolio by monitoring the relative value of opportunities across the broad mortgage universe, in an effort to achieve an optimal risk-adjusted total economic return. We believe this approach is the best way to pursue our objectives of strong core earnings and an attractive dividend and positions us well to continue to create value for our shareholders,\" Mr. Agarwal concluded.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nThe below table reflects a summary of our operating results:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nGAAP Results\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet Interest Income\n$\n19,030\n$\n18,012\nOther Income (Loss):\nRealized gain (loss) on sale of investments, net\n575\n(2)\nOther than temporary impairment\n(2,916)\n(2,972)\nUnrealized gain (loss), net\n(68,961)\n(6,730)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments, net\n79,582\n19,327\nOther, net\n47\n190\nOther Income (loss)\n8,327\n9,813\nTotal Expenses\n5,315\n4,206\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n22,042\n23,619\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n313\n2,215\nNet income (loss)\n$\n21,729\n$\n21,404\nNet income (loss) per Common Share – Basic/Diluted\n$\n0.52\n$\n0.51\nNon-GAAP Results\nCore earnings plus drop income (1)\n$\n14,149\n$\n12,998\nCore earnings plus drop income per Common Share – Basic/Diluted\n0.34\n0.31\nWeighted average yield (2)\n4.16\n%\n3.82\n%\nEffective cost of funds(3)\n2.50\n%\n2.22\n%\nAnnualized net interest margin (2)(3)\n1.90\n%\n1.79\n%\nAnnualized CPR on Agency RMBS\n11.0\n%\n10.0\n%\n(1)\nFor a reconciliation of GAAP Income to Core earnings, please refer to the Reconciliation of Core Earnings at the end of this press release.\n(2)\nIncludes interest-only securities accounted for as derivatives, foreign currency swaps and total return swaps.\n(3)\nIncludes the net amount paid, including accrued amounts for interest rate swaps and premium amortization for MAC interest rate swaps during the periods.\nPortfolio Composition\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company owned an aggregate investment portfolio totaling $5.3 billion.
