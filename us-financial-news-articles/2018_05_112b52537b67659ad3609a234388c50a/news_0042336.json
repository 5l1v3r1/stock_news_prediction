Sanders will join Amazon's Albert Cheng as co-head of television, each reporting to Salke.\n\"Having worked side-by-side with him for seven years at NBC Entertainment, I can speak first-hand to his talents as a leader and creative force,\" Salke said of Sanders in a press statement.\nAmazon is investing heavily in videos available through Prime to draw more people to the subscription club, which also features fast shipping, an incentive for members to shop more with the online retailer.\nSanders most recently had a producing deal with Universal Television, part of Comcast's NBCUniversal, since late last year.\n( Disclosure: Comcast is parent of CNBC. )", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:58:10.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
