We'll continue to ensure that the voices of the drivers and couriers are heard as we take Uber forward together.\nInsurance will be available for European drivers from June 1 onwards and will cover more than 150,000 drivers in Europe.\nUber faces challenges across the continent. In November last year, a British judge ruled that its drivers should be classified as formal workers rather than self-employed. Uber has long argued that its drivers are self-employed, rather than workers employed directly by the firm.\nLater that year, Europe's highest court, the European Court of Justice, ruled that Uber should be regulated like a transportation firm rather than a digital company.\nMeanwhile, Uber is fighting to maintain its operations in London , after the U.K. capital's transport regulator decided it would strip the ride-hailing giant of its license .\nWednesday's announcement came as Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was due to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday, alongside Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:05:51.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
