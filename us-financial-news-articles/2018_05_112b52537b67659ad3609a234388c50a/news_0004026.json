REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/File Photo\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 173.5 points last month against 172.8 March.\nFrom a year earlier, food prices on international markets rose 2.7 percent in April, FAO said.\nFAO predicted wheat output of 746.6 million tonnes for 2018, down 11.3 million tonnes from the near-record 2017 level.\nFAO said early prospects for global cereal markets in 2018/19 were favorable.\n“According to FAO’s first forecasts for the 2018/19 marketing season, cereal supplies should be sufficient to meet consumption requirements. While global cereal reserves are forecast to decline, the decrease is likely to mostly concern maize,” it said.
