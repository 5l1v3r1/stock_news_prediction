We have concluded important projects, such as the debottlenecking of Imperatriz mill, in Maranh達o state, and debuted in the tissue market, while reporting a record generation of operational cash flow and consistently deleveraging the company. As a result, we have obtained the investment grade by risk rating agency Fitch.\"\nAnother important achievement registered in 2017 was the company's debut at the Novo Mercado listing of the Brazilian stock exchange. \"This was an important step that shows Suzano's commitment to society and its shareholders,\" the CEO commented.\nMr. Schalka goes on to explain Suzano's success is the result of a drive for the company to become better every day, by increasing competitive production costs, develop new products and innovate ways to meet customer demands. He points to Suzano's 8,000+ employees as the reason for continued success.\nSuzano ended 2017 with the lowest nominal cash cost over the last years of Real 599/tonne, 3.8% down over 2016, while posting a record operational cash generation of Real 3.5 billion, 28% higher year-over-year.\nAbout Walter Schalka:\nWalter Schalka began his career at Citibank and later joined the holding company of Grupo Maepar.
