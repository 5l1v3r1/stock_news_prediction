Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter and sells about a quarter of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers. . Boeing shares advanced 1.9 percent and helped pull the Dow Jones Industrial Average into positive territory.\nSmall-cap stocks continued to outperform, and the Russell 2000 hit a record high for a third consecutive session.\nSmall-cap stocks “are somewhat insulated from how the trade talks might happen barring any kind of ... additional threat from tariffs,” Pursche said. “It makes sense that they’re not under the same type of pressure.”\nYields of U.S. 10-year Treasuries pulled back from near seven-year highs as buyers emerged after a bond sell-off earlier in the week prompted by growing inflation worries. For the week, the 10-year yield was on track to increase 12 basis points, its biggest weekly gain in a month.\nShares of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo were all lower, pulling the S&P Financial index down 0.9 percent.\nWhile banks typically benefit from higher interest rates, some investors have expressed skepticism that the banking sector has much further room to rise unless loan growth accelerates or regulations slacken considerably.\nAt 3:15PM p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.83 points, or 0.03 percent, to 24,720.81, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,713.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.62 points, or 0.31 percent, to 7,359.85.\nAlphabet Inc stock slid 1.0 percent ahead of an expected story about the tech bellwether on CBS News’ “60 minutes” this weekend.\nShares of Applied Materials dropped 7.2 percent after the chip equipment maker’s weak 2019 forecast added to concerns of softening smartphone demand.\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 1.1 percent.\nDeere & Co helped bolster the industrials sector, jumping 5.8 percent after the company raised its full-year earnings estimate.\nCampbell Soup Co fell 12.2 percent after its chief executive officer abruptly stepped down and the company cut its full-year profit forecast, saying it expects higher costs to weigh on margins.\nThe S&P Energy index down 0.7 percent for the day, but was on track for its fifth weekly gain over the last six weeks.\nCrude prices fell on Friday, but looked set to post a rise for the week in what would be a sixth straight week of gains, boosted by strong demand, looming U.S. sanctions on Iran and plummeting Venezuelan production.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
