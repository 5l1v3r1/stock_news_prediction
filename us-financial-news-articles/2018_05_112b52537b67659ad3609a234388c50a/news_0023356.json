However, the risk is that if shareholders vote this down then the shares are going to go down a lot,” said Polar Capital fund manager Dan Mahony, who owns both Shire and Takeda stock.\nThe deal must get the support of 75 percent of Shire’s voting shareholders. While some of them do not want to hold Takeda paper, Weber told reporters he believed most would accept.\n“Their board and our board is confident that both shareholders will see the benefit of the acquisition,” he said.\nJefferies analysts said they expected the shares to trade at a relatively wide discount to the offer, given the large stock component and the fact the deal is not expected to close until the first half of 2019.\nThe transaction also needs two-thirds approval from Takeda shareholders.\nGOING GLOBAL Weber became Takeda’s first non-Japanese CEO in 2015 and has been hunting for acquisitions to make the company more global and reduce its exposure to a mature Japanese pharmaceutical market.\nA Shire logo is seen outside their offices in Dublin, Ireland, April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Prior to his arrival, Takeda bought Nycomed for $14 billion in 2011 in its previous biggest deal. Last year Weber bought U.S. cancer specialist Ariad Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion.\nBuying Shire is a big financial stretch for Takeda but Weber believes it will generate substantial cash flow, enabling the enlarged group to pay down its borrowings quickly.\nTakeda said $30.1 billion in bridge loan financing would be replaced with a combination of long-term debt, hybrid capital and available cash ahead of completion, without providing a breakdown.\nThe Japanese company predicts annual cost synergies of at least $1.4 billion three years after completion, including $600 million in research and development costs, and the deal is expected to boost underlying earnings significantly from the first full year after closing.\nJobs will go, with the group’s combined 52,000 workforce likely to be reduced by 6-7 percent. The companies have a number of commercial, research and manufacturing overlaps, particularly in the United States.\nTakeda said it would maintain its global headquarters in Japan and evaluate consolidating Shire’s operations into Takeda’s in the Boston area, Switzerland and Singapore.\nUp to three Shire directors will join the board when the deal is completed and Takeda will retain the services of key staff, including Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov, who will get 200 percent of his 2018 annual salary and target bonus.\nWeber argued Takeda would be able to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a target of achieving a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0 times or less in the medium term.\n“The commitment to get down to two times EBITDA in three to five years really shows how cash-generative Shire is,” said Polar Capital’s Mahony.\nSome analysts have suggested Takeda could sell off certain Shire businesses to make the deal more manageable but Weber said gastroenterology, neuroscience, oncology, rare diseases and blood products were all important areas to be retained.\nThere may, however, be opportunities to divest certain medicines falling outside these fields.\n“There is 25 percent (of the portfolio) which is more isolated products. Some are doing very well, some less well. That’s where you could have some portfolio assessment and potentially some disposals,” Weber said.\nShire said last month it would be willing to recommend an offer from Takeda after it rejected four previous approaches.\nThe company traces its roots back to 1986, when it began as a seller of calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis, operating from an office above a shop in Hampshire, southern England. Since then, it has grown rapidly through acquisitions to generate revenues of about $15.2 billion last year.\nBut it has been under pressure in the past 12 months due to greater competition from generic drugs and debt from its widely criticized $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016.\nTakeda was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Nomura, while Shire worked with Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Japanese Takeda Pharmaceutical Co is seen at an office building in Glattbrugg near Zurich March 7, 2012.
