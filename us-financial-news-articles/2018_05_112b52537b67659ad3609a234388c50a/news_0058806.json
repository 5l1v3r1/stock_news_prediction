Customers leverage Resonant’s disruptive capabilities to design cutting edge filters and modules, while capitalizing on the added stability of a diverse supply chain through Resonant’s fabless ecosystem-the first of its kind. Working with Resonant, customers enhance the connectivity of current mobile devices, while preparing for the demands of emerging 5G applications.\nTo learn more about Resonant, view the series of videos published on its website that explain Resonant's technologies and market positioning:\nInfinite Synthesized Networks, ISN Explained What is an RF Filter? RF Filter Innovation Transforming the Mobile Filter Supply Chain\nFor more information, please visit www.resonant.com .\nAbout Resonant’s ISN® Technology\nResonant can create designs for difficult bands, modules and other complex RF Front End requirements that we believe have the potential to be manufactured for half the cost and developed in half the time of traditional approaches. ISN is a suite of proprietary mathematical methods, software design tools and network synthesis techniques that enable us to explore a much larger set of possible design solutions that regularly incorporate our proprietary technology. We then quickly deliver design simulations to our customers, which they manufacture or have manufactured by one of our foundry partners. These improved solutions still use Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) or Temperature Compensated Surface Acoustic Wave (TC-SAW) manufacturing methods and perform as well as those using higher cost manufacturing methods such as Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW). Resonant's method delivers excellent predictability, enabling achievement of the desired product performance in roughly half as many turns through the fab. In addition, because Resonant's models are fundamental, integration with its foundry and fab customers is seamless because its models speak the \"fab language\" of basic material properties and dimensions.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nGreg Falesnik\nMZ North America\n1-949-385-6449\nGreg.Falesnik@mzgroup.us\nSource:Resonant Inc.", "external_links": ["https://ir.resonant.com/videos/video/1563/infinite-synthesized-networks-isnreg-explained", "https://ir.resonant.com/videos/video/1566/resonant-isn-transforming-the-mobile-filter-supply-chain", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JBvRZA56fhNUjPxQTEJCn32JSvoeb5JlaCH7nRsJcSdR_go2mYdhUqkRszNI2py8j4xuvvpucrWsEB_5tASt4Drh62_ilSPBbZyyfcX_AE8=", "https://ir.resonant.com/videos/video/1562/what-is-an-rf-filter", "https://ir.resonant.com/videos/video/1541/rf-filter-innovation", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2fc81f2c-8a21-43c7-b694-387aaee544fe", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=44quXMxACCL3Mytaf0AB8B1QmVBbtksezGcEs8FD62Ft9dzZ4ggNsPU9aeycUY2PHpXLmkXKEfhKSd1IUfU6czYnYaDzVs_Uw5n9BiOm1wTGBmpXg-i7XaXbJ2_oJEh4Iptop9SKQL7v-WnBpW4GRT58amKhVsNZwhMlJ427BSp5Qgp5QoJxWm5c0lRUM7wvADbM7AgvCv15vJE2lQ3qkZR6UAgpFk6DDCNVmHputQw="], "published": "2018-05-30T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:24:56.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
