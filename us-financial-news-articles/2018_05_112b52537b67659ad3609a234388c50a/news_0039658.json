Most of Russia’s oil is exported as crude, a trade that has delivered diminishing returns as world oil prices have weakened over the past four years.\nSibur is banking on growing domestic consumption of petrochemical products, which are used in construction, medicine, aviation, car making, clothes, bottling, packaging and many other sectors.\n“We see quite a huge potential for growth of the Russian market,” Dmitry Konov, head of Sibur, said at the construction site of the plant on the outskirts of Tobolsk.\nOnce in operation, the complex, known as ZapSibNefteKhim, will have an annual production capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of ethylene and 500,000 tonnes of propylene.\nBANKING ON GROWTH According to Vadim Drujina, a partner at McKinsey & Co consultancy in Moscow, petrochemicals is the fastest-growing segment of crude oil consumption.\n“Growing petrochemicals demand is partly explained by substitution of traditional materials, e.g. steel, in such segments as construction and automotive,” Drujina said.\n“Given the abundance of petrochemicals feedstock it makes a lot of sense for Russia to think about further growth of petrochemicals in order to create additional value.”\nDenis Borisov, director of EY’s oil and gas center in Moscow, expects that in Russia alone, demand for petrochemicals - depending on product - will grow by 2 to 3 percent a year to 2025.\nThe location, the Russian heartland of oil production, allows Sibur to cut transportation costs as it obtains the feedstock, such as associated petroleum gas and naphtha, from nearby fields operated by other companies.\nGrigory Vygon of Vygon Consultancy in Moscow said the oil petrochemical industry is the only area of oil products consumption that will grow long-term.\n“The pace of global petrochemical growth is double the growth of the global economy,” Vygon said.\nAs they increase in prosperity emerging economies will consume more of the products, such as personal care items, paints and furnishings, that are derived from petrochemicals, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report.\n“Global economic growth is lifting more people into the middle class in developing countries and higher incomes mean sharply rising demand for consumer goods and services,” it said.\nRosneft, the world’s top publicly listed oil producer, plans to produce 3.4 million tonnes of petrochemicals in the Russian Far East.\nThe head of the company, Igor Sechin, the most influential energy official in Russia, has said the hydrocarbon share in global energy consumption will decrease in the long term, while petrochemical products and gas consumption will offset the decline in oil demand.\nGazprom has also announced plans for a large-scale gas chemical complex on the Baltic Sea with investments of around $5 billion.\nEditing by Katya Golubkova and Christian Lowe; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:57:40.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
