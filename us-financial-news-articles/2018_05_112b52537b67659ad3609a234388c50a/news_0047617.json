She is the sister-in-law of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\n“It was a tough battle for all of us... the previous administration spent so much time and money trying to get me,” she said.\n“But I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t have a deep down confidence that Malaysia could come through and this could have a good outcome.” Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T10:37:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
