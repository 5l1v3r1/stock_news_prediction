The OP Units are redeemable for cash, or at the Company's option for shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis.\n(2) Excluding the impact of $2.4 million of one-time, non-cash accelerated costs related to the repayment of our 7.375% senior notes due in 2021, AFFO for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted common share.\nThe Company is presenting FFO and AFFO because management believes they are important supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance in that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties in the evaluation of REITs. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciated real properties, plus impairments of depreciated real properties and real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nThe Company defines AFFO as funds from operations adjusted for accounting items such as non-cash stock-based compensation expense, income from mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"), changes in fair value of certain derivatives that temporarily flow through earnings, amortization and write-offs of MSRs, deferred tax (benefit) provision and the amortization of the convertible senior notes conversion option. The Company also adds back one-time charges such as acquisition costs and impairment losses on real estate and gains (losses) on sales of real estate. The Company is generally not in the business of operating real estate property and has obtained real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt related to the Company's loans to maximize the value of the collateral and minimize the Company's exposure. Therefore, the Company deems such impairment and gains (losses) on real estate as an extension of the asset management of its loans, thus a recovery of principal or additional loss on the Company's initial investment.\nFFO and AFFO are not intended to be an indication of the Company's cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or a measure of its liquidity, nor is it entirely indicative of funding the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. The Company’s calculation of FFO and AFFO may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nSource:Arbor Realty Trust", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UYN90_HQBy1HMp6zgLIU4OY_v7bkXuWx4S5LYbJGS24i9IQHM6znK3zfvtdBHKzMtMXPT-5F2a9JA2gfduRx7r7VDLfN_sIOe4Q2PnDXChs92-vkWxkuplTAGLUT5iGej4xFDZB7UNNN6MFfOlBXNMaErsf-vrd8ZQ3ExLYMWQiRhJnROpG9PHsyDI_0OyosLYA2Ve0OFpDZJWR6N-Xi3rib9RgK8bgY2gUM1A0zZ5rR3MVCAr4uesHpVo5kgt2X", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7oi4p7CnVQa4xtd9i0HDAwCFX7Ucn9HZz5W9aqlYYEpzX-DWD7SpjN6zYomcFSXZvQ6s1bMMHHvBAAvmBGwzScmwBkQtNh-yrCmzDvwnlUqE0UTByx50fgNpT36lnjof2iLFDiguTR5nj-LNLJ8H9h8d880uX3OAXjZLWHEraA-7MK0dxBDCGwRzViANmGlWK74x2uKAtv75AWeMNQxWCgt8CKQUKn3rPezE1P-kUJ0c4JAWmoyK2rByWy7BFG8y", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Ua1LReLMBcx2R32tL6nn6BfPfUJkQ31bb7wZkYrEPHA7sxqgJkOhhuwpEZh_LEGcup5ycSJCel6d44D4ob8I76ryl7ICoPQRFDIjqh2pDF-fNBc7of_wslY1kDY2h3o_", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rWdDkJwYEVMeflJXfLxMoQMawl-B5s9B_5v0kC5KKiNo-QZ3BQ_Z-_RUgHiODPYCmiIjs5Zbq5NSlIslL1tnTWXiSszJlxoarXXfgcQXmxgseqIJCR8jjG813UyIBglBUcnwdaL62TMkfs4cxmR-w3ZOO-fMJPjFd-ftQ9y_Pn0IDav3G_3YvcNctlY4xdDDUNKdM6eiCNaSTQEwLEW1rrIKUkbbPVM3ifb4lgLg-g8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d66ac613-c6eb-45e7-ba35-26af0bf6c68f", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uVLIAUFLXkL0wSUrfMCthvoYiaMpY5_lgIgN8RpG41rGkqJuL1WPgjXGzYYobjLFH3zHkMvsK2524veXr70WuLjhpFemjBqSD3388AJPFM0myJv3H0FArVh3Q2aWh9iJ6q6Cp_MF8tVdCEzsztwQOJf2FeKhrkiwR6Pk_qqDPnFISBiqPfiBXqU--IBfbYsyv9F5ho77EB_JCtCb57KEybTXwiKiPx3y7Txhy92L5IFzMnluLD6jf9G54HdkMzDZ", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OhQDIyzTTd85XxmmmUlL43ecdFbOsFkcKvzs56aHwkC0XXCOodbOAM8M3DCdV3CwQkFDFObMa4IPnIfkqNXcHjnAV49sfcqm36m1isfYRZk=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d92UzlpSzBN1hmr5VLMK66IDO4krRHOth1e8pxLIQqQjxdDERSqafKaUX657hbRo724ywewAmyVxzvrHljOIzIuOMYUjrHUeeCg4iMacd5sJGWw8SOX2TU6ZiRt6e-c-SxR-oxfX75ZhLE2d2mCx8iHgROzKJuPQ0_Su3jEC7BcbqGNUh0GJ3603CkWPyUKvzxpcgOUP8lEzG_zwtDOmBg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JOLUf9VxlJhT-jeNlcoRicdEHlh3xuPrEJ1eBS-5iPVbTCN63GD38MMcA-Y0oICq9D3EUlyvfEXYaAaOuWLHGBc4hrjE4cZ1ulicQ7NZ2Jv9nEQbzl5hZQ1zLlQuRldMRjP6ZOHrJaN-gOA3kZpGFSO1_NmuoTeFdgiC_8Zkqzun9woDQWVZgWa4fU-zxsuJ_iO-N2at93P50K3fFPFtz3Q33flV_Tzyo4CEmJjo7sE="], "published": "2018-05-04T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T18:53:02.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
