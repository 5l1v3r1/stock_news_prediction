At some point, some edits were made and that's what you saw. Someone edited it with a zombie invasion going on.\" He told the paper that \"no one was fired for it.\"\nThe zany zombie episode began at 1:41 a.m., when a message went out alerting residents to the power cuts but it also warning of a \"zombie alert for Lake Worth and Terminus.\" Terminus is nowhere near Lake Worth â€“ it's a reference to the city in the zombie TV show \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\"There are now far less than seven-thousand-three-hundred-eighty customers involved due to extreme zombie activity,\" the notice added.\nThe embarrassment follows a more alarming incident in January in which a warning about an imminent ballistic-missile threat was sent in error to residents of Hawaii.\nIn a post on Lake Worth Live, a Facebook community site, Kerr said 7,880 customers were affected and that power was restored within 27 minutes.\nThe zombies, however, remain a mystery.\nMore from USA Today:\nPolice: 'No reports of zombies' in Pennsylvania despite strange road sign Thursday\n'Zombie' raccoons are terrifying residents in Ohio\nWhy 'iZombie' is the only zombie show you need in 2018", "external_links": ["https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/17/zombie-road-sign-prank-pennsylvania/621962002/", "https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/breaking-news/breaking-lake-worth-falsely-sends-out-zombie-alert-during-power-outage/0KTfdselE7cMJXSMOYIMZK/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/05/zombie-raccoons-ohio/488624002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/01/15/hawaiis-false-missile-alert-how-happened/1033895001/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/03/02/why-izombie-only-zombie-show-you-need-2018/380970002/", "https://twitter.com/pbpost/status/998686496650682373"], "published": "2018-05-23T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T22:43:59.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
