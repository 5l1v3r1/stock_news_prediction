We also completed the acquisition of third-party benefits administrator BeneFLEX in the quarter, which will allow us to expand our product portfolio and provide additional solutions to our clients, prospects, and the insurance broker community.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue:\nTotal revenue was $113.4 million, an increase of 26% from the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nTotal recurring revenue was $108.6 million, representing 96% of total revenue and an increase of 26% from the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nOperating Income:\nGAAP operating income was $20.5 million, compared to an operating income of $14.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $28.7 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $21.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nNet Income:\nGAAP net income was $39.2 million, which includes a non-cash income tax benefit of $18.5 million, primarily related to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. This compares to a net income of $14.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net income per share was $0.71 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 based on 55.0 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Net income per share was $0.27 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, based on 54.0 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $35.8 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $26.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow:\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $129.5 million at the end of the quarter.\nCash flow from operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $35.2 million compared to $27.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in this press release, including the accompanying tables. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on information available as of May 3, 2018, Paylocity is issuing guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 as indicated below.\nFourth Quarter 2018 :\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $92.6 million to $93.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $14.0 million to $15.0 million.\nFiscal Year 2018 :\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $373.5 million to $374.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $79.6 million to $80.6 million.\nWe are unable to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their directly comparable GAAP financial measures because the information which is needed to complete a reconciliation is unavailable at this time without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Details\nPaylocity will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter fiscal year 2018 results at 4:00 p.m. Central Time today (5:00 Eastern Time).

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises, and acquisition-related costs. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted recurring gross profit are adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises, the amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense is adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises. Non-GAAP total research and development is adjusted for capitalized internal-use software costs and to eliminate stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises. Non-GAAP general and administrative expense is adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises, the amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related costs. Please note that other companies may define their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do. Management presents certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release because it considers them to be important supplemental measures of performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including analysis of the company's performance against prior periods, the preparation of operating budgets and to determine appropriate levels of operating and capital investments. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's financial and operational performance. Management also intends to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of the company’s future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of the non-GAAP financial measures should provide consistency in the company’s financial reporting. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures provided in this release.\nAcquisition-related costs: Includes legal, accounting and other professional fees as well as various other costs directly associated with acquisitions.\nSafe Harbor/forward looking statements\nThis press release contains that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
