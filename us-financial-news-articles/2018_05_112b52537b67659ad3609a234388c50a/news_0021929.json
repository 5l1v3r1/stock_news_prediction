(NASDAQ: LINK), a world-leading trusted advisor and technology partner in the advancing world of human-machine interface (HMI) and force-sensing technologies, today announced its financial results for the first quarter 2018. GAAP net income for the quarter was $118 thousand or $0.02 per share, reflecting a decrease of approximately 67% over the prior year’s results.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data and percentages)\nThree months ended March 31, Consolidated Financial Results 2018 2017 $ ∆ % ∆ Net revenue $ 2,573 $ 2,884 $ (311 ) (10.8 ) % Gross profit $ 1,411 $ 1,736 $ (325 ) (18.7 ) % Gross margin 54.8 % 60.2 % Income from Operations $ 219 $ 531 $ (312 ) (58.8 ) % Net income $ 118 $ 364 $ (246 ) (67.6 ) % Earnings per share (basic and diluted) $ 0.02 $ 0.05 $ (0.03 ) EBITDA 1\n$ 259 $ 583 $ (324 ) (55.6 ) % EBITDA margin 2\n10.1 % 20.2 % TTM EBITDA 1\n$ 1,981 $ 2,927 $ (946 ) (32.3 ) % 1 See attached schedules for reconciliation to GAAP numbers.\n2 EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by net revenue.\nRevenue in decreased approximately 11% to $2.6 million from $2.9 million in the same year-ago period, primarily due to the loss of a major customer who implemented a design change to their automotive product. However, revenue increased or remained steady in all other markets. Along with decreased revenues, gross margin decreased to 54.8% in from 60.2% in the same year-ago period, primarily due to additional costs associated with the abrupt loss of the major customer in the automotive market. In , net income was $118 thousand or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $364 thousand or $0.05 per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago period. The Company generated $259 thousand of EBITDA for , compared with $583 thousand in the same period in 2017. For the trailing twelve-month period ending March 31, 2018, EBITDA was $2.0 million, down from $2.9 million in the comparable period ending March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the company had $8.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and no debt.\n“I am confident that the investments we are making in our R&D and product expansion will set us for long-term growth,” stated Steven N. Bronson, CEO of Interlink Electronics, Inc. “We knew certain programs were nearing the end of their product cycle and we are aggressively pursuing replacement programs. Unfortunately, the timing of one of these end-of-life events was accelerated due to a major automotive customer making a design change. This has created a lull in our revenue cycle, and our financial performance reflects lower revenue, gross profit, net income and EBITDA. Demand in other markets continues to be strong, and we are prepared to capitalize on them. For example, our recent attainment of ISO 13485 Certification has exciting implications for sensor technology development in the medical device market.”\nIn December, Interlink’s Board of Directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to $1 million of the Company’s outstanding common shares. This program authorization will expire in December 2018. In January 2018, the Company repurchased 34,010 common shares under this program, at a price of $4.75 per share.\nMr. Bronson continued, “We are also actively pursuing acquisitions that broaden our technology offerings and increase our revenues. In addition, strategic, disciplined share repurchases allow us to use multiple approaches in delivering value to our stockholders.”\nAbout Interlink Electronics, Inc.\nInterlink Electronics is a world-leading trusted advisor and technology partner in the advancing world of human-machine interface (HMI) and force-sensing technologies.

These statements are based upon, among other things, assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management, including management’s own knowledge and assessment of the Company’s industry, R&D initiatives, competition and capital requirements. Other factors and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s forward-looking statements include, among other things, the following: our success in predicting new markets and the acceptance of our new products; efficient management of our infrastructure; the pace of technological developments and industry standards evolution and their effect on our target product and market choices; the effect of outsourcing technology development; changes in the ordering patterns of our customers; a decrease in the quality and/or reliability of our products; protection of our proprietary intellectual property; competition by alternative sophisticated as well as generic products; continued availability of raw materials for our products at competitive prices; disruptions in our manufacturing facilities; risks of international sales and operations including fluctuations in exchange rates; compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to our manufacturing operations; and customer concentrations.

Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Other companies may use different non-GAAP measures and presentation of results.\nIn addition to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release presents EBITDA and EBITDA margin, each of which is a non-GAAP measure. EBITDA is determined by taking net income and adding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and EBITDA margin is determined by dividing EBITDA by net revenue. Interlink believes that these non-GAAP measure, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of net income and gross margin, provide useful information to investors by providing more focused measures of operating results. These metrics are an integral part of Interlink’s internal reporting to evaluate its operations and the performance of senior management. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, is available in the accompanying financial tables below. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nAPPENDIX\nConsolidated Financial Information and Reconciliations: First Quarter 2018\nINTERLINK ELECTRONICS, INC.
