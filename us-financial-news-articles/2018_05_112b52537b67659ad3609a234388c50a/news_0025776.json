It did not reveal the names of the bidding companies.\nAlongside the Hisense, the other two bidders were identified as the Chinese firms Haier and Hefei Meiling , according to reports by local newspapers Finance, Delo and Dnevnik.\nThe three firms were not immediately available to comment.\nGorenje, one of the largest Slovenian exporters, said last year it was seeking a strategic partner to increase cost efficiency and strengthen the brand.\nThe company reported in March that its 2017 net profit fell 84 percent due to cost pressures and strong competition.\nSome of the biggest shareholders of Gorenje included the International Finance Corporation with 11.8 percent and Japanese Panasonic Corporation which holds 10.7 percent.\nPanasonic performed due diligence in Gorenje in 2016 but decided against taking over the firm, saying increasing its stake in Gorenje would not be in line with its investment strategy.\n$1 = 0.8422 euros $1 = 0.8437 euros Reporting by Marja Novak Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:48:08.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
