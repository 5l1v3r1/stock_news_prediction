But THANK YOU @RobertIger, #ChanningDungey and @ABCNetwork for standing up against bigotry.\" #Roseanne.\" Rhimes tweeted, \"Thank you, Channing. #justice.\"\nMeanwhile, screenwriter and \"Grey's Anatomy\" executive producer Krista Vernoff wrote, \"I have never been more proud to work for @ABCNetwork. THANK YOU Channing Dungey for being my one little slice of hope for our country today.\"\nFormer \"The View\" co-host Star Jones congratulated the executive, writing \"When you have a seat at the table, you have a say in the decisions that are made.
