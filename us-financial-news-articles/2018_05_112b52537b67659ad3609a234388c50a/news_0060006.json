A payment of 300,000 yuan ($46,864) to someone who helped Wumart in an acquisition was remuneration for services, rather than bribery, it added.\nIn 2008, a court in the northern province of Hebei sentenced Zhang to 18 years in prison, which was later reduced to 13 years. A higher-level Hebei court rejected an appeal in 2013 after Zhang’s early release.\n($1=6.4015 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Pei Li and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T09:38:18.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
