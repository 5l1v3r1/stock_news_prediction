The attorney general said its raids were coordinated with another authority conducting searches on the same day.\nThe Swiss newspaper, Tages-Anzeiger, citing its own findings, reported that federal tax authorities had conducted raids at Quantum Global’s Zug-based headquarters and Bastos’ Zurich-based Turtle Management on Wednesday.\nQuantum Global and Turtle Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe Federal Tax Administration declined to comment, citing tax privacy laws.\nSwitzerland’s financial watchdog said it was currently making inquiries into the matter, but declined to provide further details.\nReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:35:33.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
