It was the ninth consecutive week that prices were higher than in the corresponding year-ago week.\nThe European Union is by far the biggest export market for Norwegian salmon, buying 80.9 percent of volumes last week, up from 82.0 percent the previous week.\nCombined for China and Vietnam, volumes last week dropped to 233 tonnes from 614 tonnes in same week last year.\nSeparately, volumes to Hong Kong rose to 224 tonnes last week from 171 tonnes in same week last year.
