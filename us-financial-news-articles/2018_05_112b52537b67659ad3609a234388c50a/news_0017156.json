(Nasdaq:BECN) (“Beacon” or the “Company”) announced results today for its second quarter ended March 31, 2018 and first half ended March 31, 2018 of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 (“2018”).\nPaul Isabella, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Second quarter results fell short of our expectations, as harsh winter weather conditions limited customers available work days. The year-to-year temperature declines, particularly throughout the Midwest, Ohio Valley and South, produced one of the most significant temperature drops in the past several decades. The cold weather, combined with heavier February precipitation and March snowstorms, created a difficult environment for the roofing industry. Despite this challenging environment, our organic sales were flat year over year bolstered by strong volume from hurricane impacted areas and our early efforts in passing through manufacturer price increases. Second quarter pricing improved more than 200 basis points versus last year, representing a 2 nd consecutive quarterly gain and our highest increase in more than five years. While gross margins saw timing related price-cost headwinds, we are confident pricing will continue to improve over the coming months. Adjusted operating costs as a percent of sales were above year ago levels reflecting increased spending to serve the hurricane impacted markets, a higher cost structure at Allied and synergy timing. We will continue to focus our efforts on actions aimed to increase sales, drive higher gross margins and lever our cost structure during the busiest part of the year. Additionally, we remain committed to investing in our future as evidenced through initiatives such as ecommerce, continuous improvement and enhancements to our pricing model. Successful early integration efforts associated with the Allied combination have provided us the confidence to raise our synergy expectations. After just four months of ownership, the talented employees of Allied are already adding significant value to the Beacon organization. Beacon remains committed to driving growth organically and through acquisitions while lowering our overall net debt leverage, adding value through technology investments, and executing the Allied integration plan.”\nSecond Quarter\nTotal sales increased 63.7% to a second quarter record of $1.43 billion, up from $870.7 million in 2017. Residential roofing product sales increased 19.7%, non-residential roofing product sales increased 35.6% and complementary product sales increased 263.2% over the prior year. Existing markets sales, excluding acquisitions, decreased 0.1% for the quarter. The second quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 each had 64 business days.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter was ($72.7) million, compared to ($9.4) million in 2017. Second quarter EPS was ($1.07), compared to ($0.16) in 2017. Adjusted Net Income (Loss), after removing the impact of acquisition related costs and the net benefit from one-time tax items, was a loss of ($23.5) million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $5.0 million in 2017. Second quarter Adjusted EPS was a loss of ($0.35), compared to $0.08 in 2017. (See included financial tables for a reconciliation of “Adjusted” financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures). Second quarter results were positively impacted by strong existing and acquired sales growth within our complementary products category, improved company-wide gross margins and early synergy benefits attributable to the purchase of Allied. Second quarter 2018 EPS was negatively impacted by winter weather conditions that lowered customer activity, higher operating expenses, increased interest expense, and the impact from preferred dividends.\nFirst Half\nTotal sales increased 36.0% to a first half record of $2.55 billion, up from $1.87 billion in 2017. Residential roofing product sales increased 15.2%, non-residential roofing product sales increased 18.6% and complementary product sales increased 138.1% over the prior year. Existing markets sales, excluding acquisitions, increased 4.4% for the first half. The first half of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 each had 125 business days.\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders for the first half was ($5.1) million, compared to $11.1 million in 2017. First half EPS was ($0.07), compared to $0.18 in 2017. Adjusted Net Income (Loss), after removing the impact of acquisition related costs and the net benefit from one-time tax items, was $23.2 million in the first half 2018, compared to $39.4 million in 2017. First half Adjusted EPS was $0.34, compared to $0.64 in 2017. (See included financial tables for a reconciliation of “Adjusted” financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures). First half results were positively impacted by strong net sales growth, contributions from our 2017 acquisitions, and beneficial tax adjustments. First half 2018 EPS was negatively impacted by lower gross margins, higher operating costs, and increased interest expense.\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss these results.

We believe that Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is an operating performance metric that is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance. Adjusted net income per share or \"Adjusted EPS\" is calculated by dividing the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the period by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for the period (see Consolidated Statements of Operations for amounts). 2 Acquisition costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include $34.6 million of non-recurring charges related to acquisitions and $37.1 million of amortization expense related to intangibles, both net of $21.1 million in tax in total. Acquisition costs for the three months ended March 31, 2017 include $3.1 million of non-recurring charges related to acquisitions and $20.3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles, both net of $9.0 million in tax in total. Acquisition costs for the six months ended March 31, 2018 include $52.5 million of non-recurring charges related to acquisitions and $55.2 million of amortization expense related to intangibles, both net of $31.5 million in tax in total. Acquisition costs for the six months ended March 31, 2017 include $5.9 million of non-recurring charges related to acquisitions and $40.4 million of amortization expense related to intangibles, both net of $17.8 million in tax in total. 3 The non-recurring impact of deferred tax asset revaluation and a recognized provisional expense related to the repatriation of earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary, Beacon Roofing Supply Canada Company. While we believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are useful measures for investors, these are not measurements presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). You should not consider Adjusted Net Income (Loss) or Adjusted EPS in isolation or as a substitute for net income and net income per share or diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nBEACON ROOFING SUPPLY, INC.

EBITDA is a measure commonly used in the distribution industry, and we present Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is used in our bank covenants and we use Adjusted EBITDA as an internal performance measurement and as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles, and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. Further, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure because it improves comparability of results of operations, since purchase accounting used for acquisitions can render depreciation and amortization non-comparable between periods. We use these supplemental measures to evaluate performance period over period and to analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. We expect to compute Adjusted EBITDA using the same consistent method from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 2 Acquisition costs reflect all non-recurring charges related to acquisitions (excluding the impact of tax) that are not embedded in other balances of the table. Certain portions of the total acquisition costs incurred are included in interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. While we believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for investors, it is not a measurement presented in accordance with GAAP. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operations, or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA has inherent material limitations as a performance measure. It does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization expense. Because we have capital and intangible assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs. Adjusted EBITDA also does not include stock-based compensation, which is a necessary element of our costs since we make stock awards to key members of management as an important incentive to maximize overall company performance and as a benefit. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA does not include taxes, and payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations. Accordingly, since Adjusted EBITDA excludes these items, it has material limitations as a performance measure. We separately monitor capital expenditures, which impact depreciation expense, as well as amortization expense, interest expense, stock-based compensation expense, and income tax expense. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006646/en/\nBeacon Roofing Supply, Inc.\nJoseph Nowicki, Executive VP & CFO\n571-323-3940\nJNowicki@becn.com\nSource: Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.beaconroofingsupply.com%2Fevents.cfm&esheet=51802929&newsitemid=20180508006646&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.beaconroofingsupply.com%2Fevents.cfm&index=1&md5=878015bb90175bf0d04f0f6618cb558d", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006646/en/", "http://ir.beaconroofingsupply.com/events.cfm", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.becn.com&esheet=51802929&newsitemid=20180508006646&lan=en-US&anchor=www.becn.com&index=2&md5=df975ee6c8ff9020e7193f3a64409b32"], "published": "2018-05-09T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:18:52.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
