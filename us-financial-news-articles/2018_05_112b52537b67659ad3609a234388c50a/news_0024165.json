The figure was higher than the $200 million many analysts had expected, but Nvidia's disclosure of the figures should help investors gauge its impact on the chipmaker's finances, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.\nBut Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that the company expects cryptocurrency-related revenue to be only about one-third of the fiscal first quarter's level during the next quarter. Retail for Nvidia's gaming chips surged earlier this year as miners snapped up chips, a development Nvidia addressed by releasing mining-specific chips.\n\"While supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing,\" Kress told investors on a conference call. \"As a result, we are pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price.\"\nRevenue from Nvidia's data center business, which powers cloud-based services such as Amazon.com 's Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp's Azure as well as Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud, rose 71 percent to $701 million, but missed analysts' estimate of $703 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\"I think its (Nvidia's share price) down because the revenue beat was mainly from cryptocurrency-related revenue,\" said Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. He said Nvidia's earnings were mostly in line with expectations, \"which may not be good enough for shares trading at 40x forward earnings.\"\nRevenue from Nvidia's best-known business of gaming chips, also used by cryptocurrency miners, rose 68 percent to $1.72 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.65 billion.\nA cryptocurrency boom has powered growth at Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc as their graphics chips provide the high computing ability needed to mine popular virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, but the sector is battling volatility caused by swings in the currency's value.\nRevenue from Nvidia's automotive business, which includes its Drive platform used in self-driving cars, rose 4 percent to $145 million, also topping analysts' estimate of $132 million.\nNvidia in March suspended self-driving tests across the globe, a week after an Uber Technologies Inc autonomous vehicle struck and killed a 49-year-old woman crossing a street in Arizona.\nThe company's net income rose to $1.24 billion, or $1.98 per share, in the first quarter ended April 29, from $507 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.\nTotal revenue rose to $3.21 billion from $1.94 billion.\nExcluding items, Nvidia earned $2.05 per share.\nAnalysts on average had expected revenue of $2.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
