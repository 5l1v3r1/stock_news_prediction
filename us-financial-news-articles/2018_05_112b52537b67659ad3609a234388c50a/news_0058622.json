Management had previously announced plans to complete up to four acquisitions in 2018. Management now anticipates closing up to five acquisitions in 2018. Achieving the Company’s plans remains dependent on Management’s ability to acquire profitable home care businesses and to raise adequate funds to complete such acquisitions.\nManagement had previously indicated that it anticipated Nova Leap would exit 2018 with at least a $10 million revenue run rate. Management believes that it will exceed a $10 million revenue run rate by the end of Q2 2018. Management is now targeting to exit 2018 with a revenue run rate range of $14 million to $15 million.\nThe implementation of a common technology platform across the Company’s home care agencies has begun and is expected to continue as new agencies are acquired. It is Management’s intention to begin the implementation of a common brand strategy in the United States in Q3 2018.\nAbout Nova Leap\nThe Home Care Providers industry is becoming one of the fastest growing healthcare industries in Canada and the United States. Home care saves patients billions of dollars every year by treating them in their own homes instead of in hospitals. An aging population, the prevalence of chronic disease, growing physician acceptance of home care, medical advancements and a movement toward cost-efficient treatment options from public and private payers have all fostered industry growth. Nova Leap is focused on a highly fragmented market of small privately-held companies providing patients one on one care in their homes. Nova Leap's post-acquisition organic growth strategy is to increase annual revenue per location through a combination of increased employee investment, including training, focused sales and marketing efforts, billing rate increases, expansion of geographical coverage, and improved referral sources.\nNON-GAAP MEASURE:\nAnnual recurring revenue run rate is the expected annualized recurring revenue based on the most recent month’s actual revenue for current operations multiplied by 12.\nFor acquisitions that closed subsequent to the reporting period or are expected to close and have been disclosed in a press release as material information, annual recurring revenue run rate is the expected annualized recurring revenue based on the most recent month’s revenue for current operations multiplied by 12 plus the annual revenue based on the most recent financial information available for the newly acquired operations or operations which are expected to close and have been disclosed in a press release as material information.\nFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION:\nCertain information in this press release may contain forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding future expansions and cost savings, the Company’s expected 2018 revenue run rate and plans regarding future acquisitions and financings.
