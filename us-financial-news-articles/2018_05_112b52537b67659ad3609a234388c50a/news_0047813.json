Sanctions that had been lifted under the agreement are due to go back into effect, and they are expected to pressure an already shaky economy.\n\"This is just the beginning. The sting of sanctions will be painful,\" Pompeo said before a packed house at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"These will be the strongest sanctions in history when complete.\"\nAmong other demands, Pompeo said Iran must stop developing ballistic missiles, release Americans who are being held in prisons in the country, and stop support of militant and terrorist groups in the Middle East and beyond. He also called for a ban on a heavy-water reactor, which is the most basic way to develop nuclear energy.\n\"Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East,\" Pompeo said.\nWhile threatening heavy consequences for Iran's economy if the country does pursue nuclear weapons, he also reached out to the Iranian people — painting a picture of a corrupt regime that steals from its people while boosting international terrorist groups.\n\"Is this what you want your country to be known for?\" Pompeo asked, referring to Iranian support for groups such as Hezbollah. \"The United States believes you deserve better.\"\nPompeo also offered potential benefits to Iranians: \"Unlike the previous administration, we are looking for outcomes that benefit the Iranian people, not just the regime.\"\nThe secretary of State also used the administration's ongoing negotiations with North Korea as a model for a new agreement with Iran, saying it demonstrates a commitment to diplomacy against even the biggest adversaries of the U.S.\nPompeo is a former GOP congressman who previously was director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T17:05:15.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
