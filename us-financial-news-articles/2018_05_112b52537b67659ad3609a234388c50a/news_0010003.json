The increase in revenue primarily reflects the sales related to our expanded product portfolio, including flat panels, wall packs, high bays, controls and other solutions. Gross profit was $11.5 million and $10.1 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The favorable mix of products and the impact of our restructuring efforts improved our gross profit margin to 34% for 2018 compared to 33% for 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined below) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.0 million compared to $(0.4) million for the comparable period in 2017. The Company reported an operating loss of $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to an operating loss of $4.2 million in the same period in 2017, as a result of increased gross margins and decreased expenses.\nReported GAAP net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2.2 million compared to a net loss of $5.0 million for the comparable period in 2017, and reflects the aforementioned. Basic and diluted GAAP loss per share attributable to common stockholders was $0.10 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.24 for the same period in 2017. Excluding the one-time acquisition, work force reductions and stock-based compensation, the non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.06 in 2018 compared to non-GAAP a net loss of $0.15 for the same period in 2017.\nLiquidity Position\nCash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $4.4 million and primarily reflects increases in inventory, vendor deposits and prepaid assets to support customer requirements for the second quarter of 2018. Increased sales and collections beginning in our second quarter and continuing throughout the year will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our future operations. As of March 31, 2018, our availability, including cash, under our Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $3.5 million.\nGuidance\nThe Company expects Q2 2018 revenue in the $40 - $43 million range and Adjusted EBITDA in the 6% - 8% range. The Company expects full year 2018 revenue in the $165 - $175 million range ($152 million in 2017) and Adjusted EBITDA in the 8% - 10% range.\nFurther information on Revolution Lighting Technologies' quarterly results can be found in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and may be accessed on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nQ1 2018 Conference Call\nRevolution Lighting Technologies will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss these financial results at 11 a.m. ET on May 1, 2018. To access the conference call by phone, dial 1-877-326-9228 for the U.S. and 1-412-317-5110 for international callers. All Participants should request to be joined into the Revolution Lighting Technologies Call. The webcast will be available on the Company's website at www.rvlti.com . An audio replay of the call will also be available to investors by phone beginning at approximately 2 p.m. ET on May 1, 2018 until 11:59 p.m. ET on May 15, 2018 by dialing 1-877-344-7529 within the U.S. or 1-412-317-0088 for international callers and entering passcode # 10119328.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA as non-U.S. GAAP measures of financial performance. We consider these non-GAAP measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance, and a useful measure of historical and prospective trends. However, there are significant limitations of the use of these non-GAAP measures since they exclude acquisition related charges and stock-based compensation, both of which affect profitability. We believe that these limitations are compensated by providing these non-GAAP measures along with U.S. GAAP performance measures and clearly identifying the differences between the two measures.\nConsequently, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss) or net income (loss) per share presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA as defined by Revolution Lighting may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other entities. These non-GAAP measures are provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to help investors analyze the operating trends in the business and to assess the relative underlying performance of the business. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial results with other companies that use non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA in their communications with investors. Management also uses non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate potential acquisitions establish internal budgets and goals and evaluate the performance of business units and management.\nA reconciliation of Revolution Lighting GAAP net income (loss) to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ending March 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively follows:\n(in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (2.2 ) $ (5.0 ) Amortization and depreciation 1.4 2.0 Stock-based compensation 0.7 1.1 Acquisition, severance and transition costs\n0.2 0.7 Interest and other expense 0.9 0.8 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1.0 $ (0.4 ) The following table reconciles net income (loss) to non-GAAP net income (loss) for the periods presented:\n(in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (2.2 ) $ (5.0 ) Acquisition, severance and transition costs\n0.2 0.7 Stock-based compensation 0.7 1.1 Non-GAAP net income (loss) $ (1.3 ) $ (3.2 ) The following table reconciles diluted net income (loss) per share to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share for the periods presented:\n(in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (0.10 ) $ (0.24 ) Acquisition, severance and transition costs\n0.01 0.03 Stock-based compensation 0.03 0.06 Non-GAAP net income (loss) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.15 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, diluted (In thousands) 21,822 20,599 About Revolution Lighting Technologies, Inc.\nRevolution Lighting Technologies, Inc. is a leader in the design, manufacture, marketing, and sale of LED lighting solutions focusing on the industrial, commercial and government markets in the United States, Canada, and internationally.
