The cutting-edge trading system — xTrader — that Mr. Risler developed at CIBC became and still is the trading and risk-management system in place for all derivatives businesses for all asset classes globally at the bank.\n“I have had the pleasure to work with FTI Consulting’s Economic Consulting and Corporate Finance professionals on numerous engagements, and I have been impressed by the depth and strength of talent in the organization; they are one of the leading teams in the world,” Mr. Risler said. “I am excited by the opportunity to join the team and advise global financial institutions and trading firms on some of the most complex risk-management and trading challenges, as well as designing and implementing fully thought-out executable solutions and innovative strategies for our clients.”\nMr. Risler earned his Ph.D. in numerical mathematics from École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay and a master’s of science in management from ESSEC Business School in France.
