Google executive Kent Walker is repeating a pledge he made in November to create a library of such ads that will be searchable by anyone. The goal is to have this ready this summer.\nGoogle's blog post comes short of declaring support for the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would impose disclosure requirements on online ads, similar to what's required for television and other media. Facebook and Twitter support that bill.\nGoogle didn't immediately provide details on how the ID verification would work for online ad buys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T20:59:50.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
