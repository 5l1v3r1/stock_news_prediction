Of the $870,230 Net Loss, we expended cash of $515,006 in G&A expenses which was provided by our first quarter cash raises and existing cash balances.\nAngelo Ponzetta, 12 ReTech's CEO commented, \"Our Company is making progress on the execution of our business plan in a number of areas. In the first quarter of 2018, we invested in Research and Development projects that are producing technology that we are in the process of deploying. Our 12Sconti product development began in January, 2018. In short order, we are going to activate this product in Switzerland and already have merchant clients signed up to utilize it to improve their daily sales operations.”\nCEO Ponzetta, continued, “We have also invested into the further development of our 12 Technology Suite and are about to deploy the improved versions of these products in Switzerland and Japan. Soon thereafter, we will be actively selling a new and improved set of these products in Asia, Europe and North America.”\n\"Our subsidiary, 12 Retail's microbrand acquisition strategy has begun to gain traction as well. With the recently completed acquisition of Emotion Apparel, the Company now has a platform to make future acquisitions, reduce manufacturing and distribution costs, and provide fresh fashion products to sell on our online sales channel which will create customer engagement. As Emotion Apparel completes its move from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City we will then be able to ramp up revenues from this operation alone. While our three previously announced Letters of Intent are still in process, we are getting inquiries from additional consumer product brands who we are speaking to us about our brand roll up strategy. We are working on several opportunities and expect to be able to make some interesting announcements in the very near future. It is interesting to me, that a number of these opportunities are coming to us from the west coast of the U.S.A.”\nCEO Ponzetta, continued “I am pleased with the progress that we are making on all of our various business activities. Each separate business activity will provide us with a foundation to produce revenues and earnings for our shareholders in the future. We continue to work towards a successful future in executing our business plan.”\nCEO Ponzetta, concluded “Recently, there have some new partnerships that have been brought to us that are very exciting and could get us noticed in the retail world that are about incorporating next generation PCI compliant credit card equipment into our offerings and offering consumers a white labeled 12 Credit product More to come on these important topics later.”\nThe figures referenced above are unaudited, Readers are advised to consider these figures along with footnotes and any other accompanying information that is contained in the Company’s Form 10-Q as well as additional filings that the Company has previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout 12 ReTech Corporation:\nAt our core, we are a software company whose technology allows retailers to combat the dual threats of Walmart and Amazon — both online and in physical stores.
