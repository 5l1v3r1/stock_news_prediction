Foreign Policy reported that one person who was at the forum in Miami said that Cohen had \"sat in one roundtable discussion\" at the event.\nA spokesman for the Qatari embassy said that Cohen had asked for the meeting with Al Thani, but would not confirm the meeting happened.\n\"The State of Qatar has never been a client of Mr. Cohen,\" the spokesman told Foreign Policy.\nCNBC has requested comment from Qatar's embassy, as well as from Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen.\nQatar's leader, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, met with Trump in the Oval Office at the tail end of the roadshow, on April 10.\nJust a day earlier, on April 9, FBI agents, armed with search warrants, raided the New York City home and office of Cohen, as well as a hotel room where he and his family had been staying while their apartment was being renovated.\nThe agents, acting on behalf of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, seized documents and electronic files, as well as cells phones and other electronic devices. Prosecutors are investigating Cohen for possible crimes related to his business dealings.

But Trump and his new lawyer, Rudy Giuliani , in recent weeks have confirmed that the president reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels , despite Trump's previous claim that he had no knowledge of the hush-money payoff.\nOn May 8, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Daniels, revealed that records showed that four other entities — drug giant Novartis , AT&T , defense contractor Korean Aerospace Industries and private equity firm Columbus Nova — had paid Cohen hundreds of thousands of dollars after Trump became president.\nColumbus Nova is closely tied to Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch who is himself closely linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin .\nColumbus Nova has said Vekselberg played no role in its decision to hire Cohen as a \"business consultant,\" for a reported amount of $500,000.
