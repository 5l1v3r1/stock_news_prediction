REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo Asked directly by reporters if he had resigned, Mahumapelo said in televised remarks that he was waiting to hear from the executive committee of the ruling African National Congress.\n“I will listen to what the PEC (Provincial Executive Committee) say ... Let’s wait and see,” he said as a boisterous crowd of ANC supporters shouted and chanted nearby.\nActing North West provincial secretary Susan Dantjie told journalists after a PEC meeting that Mahumapelo has been instructed to go on leave pending an investigation into governance issues in the province.\n“The PEC resolved that Comrade Supra Mahumapelo must take leave and allow the inter-ministerial task team to proceed with the processes and in the meantime must appoint an acting premier,” she said.\nMahumapelo is a political ally of scandal-plagued former president Jacob Zuma, replaced in February by Cyril Ramaphosa, who has vowed to clean up governance in Africa’s most industrialized economy.\nLast month Ramaphosa cut short a visit to a Commonwealth summit in Britain to travel to North West and calm tensions after crowds began protesting against poor public services and demanding Mahumapelo’s resignation.\nRamaphosa placed the platinum-rich province’s health and treasury departments under central government control and deployed army medics to treat hospital patients.\nReporting by Ed Stoddard and Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Ed Cropley and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T09:30:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
