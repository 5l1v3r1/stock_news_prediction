Democrats need a net gain of just two seats to retake control of the chamber in November’s midterms.\n“They’ve been on [a] good footing,” a senior administration official said.\nRelated Reading\nDon Blankenship Draws Swipe From Trump Before West Virginia Vote Trump Criticizes McConnell for Failure to Advance Health-Law Reform Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a reception with Mr. McConnell on Monday at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the first time any administration official has met with a McConnell-linked super PAC. About 100 donors and Republican candidates attended.\nThat group, Senate Leadership Fund, has raised at least $24 million so far between January 2017 and the end of April 2018, according to new Federal Election Commission filings. A McConnell-linked nonprofit called One Nation has raised $34 million, according to its officials. Both groups can accept unlimited amounts from donors, but elected officials are barred from soliciting those contributions.\nThe improved relationship with Mr. McConnell was born out of the fight for tax legislation last year, aides said. Both realized they needed to work together to pass a bill, and they established trust in the process.\nDuring that debate, they would split up calls to reluctant lawmakers depending on who had the best chance for success. Mr. Trump, for example, was charged with corralling Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.), while Mr. McConnell held most of the substantive talks with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, said people familiar with the calls.\n“Our legislative fate is tied to both McConnell and the president’s political success,” said Marc Short, the White House legislative-affairs director.\nThe stronger relationship was evident to lawmakers when Mr. Trump visited the Republican Senate conference last week for lunch, White House officials said. He and Mr. McConnell were cordial as they talked politics before the luncheon and the president now treats Mr. McConnell “like a close adviser,” one White House official said.\nThe weekend before the West Virginia primary, Mr. Trump called Mr. McConnell to ask his advice on whether he should weigh in, as some in the White House had urged him to do.\n“Of course,” Mr. McConnell said.\nThe result: The day before the primary, Mr. Trump tweeted , in part, “To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way!”\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey won . He will face Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin this fall, although Mr. Blankenship said Monday he would seek to run as a third-party candidate .\nBefore Mr. Trump weighed in, Mr. McConnell’s supporters had been working to tamp down Mr. Blankenship’s chances. The Senate Leadership Fund secretly bankrolled a $1.4 million attack ad campaign against Mr. Blankenship, saying the former coal magnate, who served a year in prison for a mine-safety conviction, was too toxic for the Senate.\nNewsletter Sign-up On Monday, Mr. Blankenship made it clear he is still spoiling for a fight with Mr. McConnell and other Republican Party leaders. “Now that we know that the establishment will lie and resort to anything else necessary to defeat me, we are better prepared than before,” he said in a statement.\nMr. Trump has also stayed neutral in some primary races, in part at Mr. McConnell’s urging, aides to both men said. The president has talked up all three candidates for an open Senate seat in Arizona being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. And he has intervened to strengthen the party in shaky races in several battleground states. In Nevada, he cleared the primary field for Sen. Dean Heller by urging his rival, Danny Tarkanian, to drop out and run for the House.\nMr. Trump “is listening to Mitch McConnell because he doesn’t want to get burned again,” said Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor and chief executive of a Colorado-based drilling services company.\nHe said Mr. Trump has closely hewed to Mr. McConnell’s thinking after a special election in Alabama last year embarrassed many in the party.\nMr. McConnell, and belatedly Mr. Trump, backed Sen. Luther Strange in the GOP primary but h e was defeated by former judge Roy Moore . When Mr. Moore was battered by charges he had sexual encounters with teenage girls when he was in his 30s, Mr. Trump stumped for him against the advice of Mr. McConnell and others.\nDemocrat Doug Jones defeated Mr. Moore in December. In his tweet before the West Virginia primary, Mr. Trump invoked that loss: “Remember Alabama.”\n—Janet Hook contributed to this article.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nDemocrats need a net gain of just two seats to retake control of the Senate in November’s midterms.
