A former top official says 'maybe'\nBitcoin sees Wall Street warm to trading virtual currency\nInside Nike, the new departures may provide more reassurance to employees seeking signs that Mr. Parker is trying to address the workplace problems that have plagued the company in recent years. But for Wall Street, the internal turmoil could be worrisome and prompt questions about whether Nike will have the leaders it needs in place to execute its aggressive business strategy.\nSix top executives have previously left the company or have said they would leave in connection with the investigation. In March, Nike announced the departures of Trevor Edwards, the president of the Nike brand and a potential successor to Mr. Parker; and Jayme Martin, who oversaw many of Nike's global businesses. Other managers who subsequently left included the head of diversity and inclusion and a head of footwear.\nThe latest departures come amid a rash of rumors and speculation that more managerial changes are in store at the company's Beaverton, Ore., campus in the wake of a revolt, led by women, that is shaking up Nike's executive ranks.\nEarlier this year, a group of women at the company began an informal survey that sought input on discrimination and sexual harassment at the company. The survey was presented to Mr. Parker on March 5, and 10 days later, the executive shake-up began with the announcement that Mr. Edwards was resigning.\nThe moves come a little more than a week after The New York Times, using interviews with more than 50 current and former Nike employees, reported about women's complaints of being marginalized, harassed and thwarted in their careers at the company, and about indignities that included humiliating visits to strip clubs and unwanted kisses. Many of those interviewed said when they took their grievances to human resources, they seemed to not be taken seriously.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/upshot/should-the-fed-create-fedcoin-to-rival-bitcoin-a-former-top-official-says-maybe.html?&moduleDetail=section-news-1&action=click&contentCollection=Business%20Day&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/bitcoin-new-york-stock-exchange.html?&moduleDetail=section-news-0&action=click&contentCollection=Business%20Day&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/business/dealbook/elon-musk-warren-buffett-candy.html?&moduleDetail=section-news-2&action=click&contentCollection=Business%20Day&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/business/nike-women.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/mark-parker-nike.html"], "published": "2018-05-08T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T18:24:18.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
