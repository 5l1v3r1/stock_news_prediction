At the time, the UNHCR called it a “milestone”.\nMyanmar’s new government led by Aung San Suu Kyi has made ending long-running insurgencies by various ethnic minority guerrilla groups a priority, though its efforts have been mixed.\nAttacks last year on the security forces by a new guerrilla faction drawn from the Rohingya Muslim minority in western Myanmar triggered a sweeping Myanmar government offensive and the exodus to Bangladesh of some 700,000 Rohingya civilians, according to U.N. estimates.\nThe UNHCR said on Tuesday the situation in Myanmar’s western Rakhine State was “not yet conducive for the return of Rohingya refugees”.\nHeavy fighting has erupted intermittently in Kachin State in northern Myanmar in recent years, including over the past few weeks. A 17-year ceasefire between Kachin guerrillas and the government collapsed in 2011.\nThere are also occasional clashes between guerrillas and government forces in Shan State in the northeast.
