Note: A detailed reconciliation of the reported (GAAP) financial information to the adjusted financial information is included at the end of this news release. CFO Comments\nCampbell’s Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said, “While our organic sales in the quarter were stable in this difficult environment, our gross margin performance was below our expectations. Based on our third-quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are lowering our fiscal 2018 earnings guidance.\n“In the third quarter, we made some progress against our key priorities. We completed the Snyder’s-Lance acquisition, substantially expanding our portfolio in the faster growing snacking categories, and we made some progress in stabilizing sales in U.S. soup. However, we are not satisfied with our financial results. Our performance has been impacted by both execution-related and external challenges. We are addressing these challenges with renewed urgency. Looking ahead, we will be reviewing all aspects of our strategic plans and portfolio composition. We anticipate that our review, which will take several months to complete, will lead to changes designed to improve our operating performance and create long-term shareholder value. We plan to discuss the outcome of this review when we report fourth-quarter and full-year results in late August.”\nItems Impacting Comparability\nThe table below presents a summary of items impacting comparability in each period. A detailed reconciliation of the reported (GAAP) financial information to the adjusted information is included at the end of this news release.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended Apr. 29, Apr. 30, Apr. 29, Apr. 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 As Reported (GAAP) ($1.31) $0.58 $0.55 $1.85 Impairment charges related to the Campbell Fresh segment $1.65 - $1.89 $0.58 Restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs associated with cost savings initiatives\n$0.15\n$0.01\n$0.34\n$0.04\nTransaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance $0.15 - $0.22 - Claim settlement $0.05 - $0.05 - Pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments -\n- ($0.03) $0.04 Nonrecurring net tax benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform -\n- ($0.40) - Adjusted $0.70* $0.59 $2.62 $2.51 *Numbers do not add due to rounding. Third-Quarter Results\nSales increased 15 percent to $2.125 billion driven by a 14-point benefit from the recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods and a 1-point favorable impact from currency translation. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh were offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages.\nGross margin decreased from 35.9 percent to 29.1 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted gross margin decreased 3.9 percentage points to 32.0 percent. The decrease in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, as well as the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and higher promotional spending, partly offset by productivity improvements and the benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nMarketing and selling expenses increased 9 percent to $232 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 8 percent primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions, partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. Administrative expenses increased 15 percent to $163 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted administrative expenses decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower incentive compensation and benefit costs, partly offset by the impact of recent acquisitions.\nOther expenses of $647 million were primarily due to the impairment charges related to the Campbell Fresh segment. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted other income decreased $3 million to $12 million.\nAs reported EBIT was a loss of $475 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT increased 1 percent to $308 million. Excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods, adjusted EBIT declined primarily due to lower gross margin performance, partly offset by lower adjusted administrative expenses and lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses.\nNet interest expense increased $14 million to $42 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, net adjusted interest expense increased $32 million to $60 million due to debt associated with the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio. The tax rate was 24.0 percent as compared to 34.8 percent in the prior year. Excluding items impacting comparability, the adjusted tax rate decreased 19.7 percentage points to 15.3 percent as the timing of tax expense on an adjusted basis was impacted by the impairment charges.\nThe company reported a loss of $1.31 per share. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EPS increased 19 percent to $0.70 per share, reflecting a lower adjusted tax rate, partly offset by higher adjusted net interest expense.\nNine-Month Results\nSales increased 4 percent to $6.466 billion driven by a 5-point benefit from the recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods and a 1-point favorable impact from currency translation, partly offset by a 1-percent decline in organic sales. Declines in organic sales were primarily driven by decreases in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, partly offset by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks.\nAs reported EBIT was $180 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT decreased 7 percent to $1.127 billion reflecting lower gross margin performance, including the impact of organic sales declines, partly offset by an increase in adjusted other income.\nNet interest expense increased $20 million to $104 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, net adjusted interest expense increased $38 million to $122 million due to debt associated with the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio. Tax expense decreased from $307 million in the prior year to a tax benefit of $91 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, the adjusted tax rate decreased 10.0 percentage points to 21.3 percent primarily due to the lower U.S. federal tax rate and the timing of tax expense on an adjusted basis related to the impairment charges.\nThe company reported EPS of $0.55. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EPS increased 4 percent to $2.62 per share, reflecting a lower adjusted tax rate and the benefit of lower weighted average shares outstanding, partly offset by lower adjusted EBIT and higher adjusted net interest expense.\nCash flow from operations increased to $1.024 billion from $1.011 billion a year ago reflecting higher cash earnings, partly offset by an increase in working capital requirements.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nBased on the company’s current outlook for fiscal 2018, including the impact of the Snyder’s-Lance acquisition, Campbell has revised its fiscal 2018 guidance as shown in the table below. This guidance assumes the impact from currency translation will be nominal.\n($ in millions, except per share)\nSnyder’s-\n2017 Revised 2018 Guidance Lance\nRevised Results Before Snyder’s-Lance Acquisition 2018 Guidance Net Sales $7,890 0 to +1% +9 to +10 pts +10 to +11% (Previously -1 to +1%) Adjusted EBIT $1,492* -11 to -9% +3 pts -8 to -6% (Previously -7 to -5%) Adjusted EPS $3.04* -3 to -1% -3 pts -6 to -5% (Previously +2 to +4%) -$0.10 $2.85 to $2.90 * Adjusted – refer to the detailed reconciliation of the reported (GAAP) financial information to the adjusted financial information at the end of this news release.

Note: A detailed reconciliation of the reported (GAAP) net sales to organic net sales is included at the end of this news release. Americas Simple Meals and Beverages\nSales in the quarter increased 5 percent to $1.010 billion reflecting a 6-point benefit from the acquisition of Pacific Foods. Organic sales decreased 2 percent primarily driven by declines in V8 beverages, Plum products and U.S. soup. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. soup decreased 1 percent driven by declines in condensed soups, partly offset by gains in broth and ready-to-serve soups.\nSegment operating earnings decreased 3 percent to $217 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower administrative expenses and lower marketing and selling expenses.\nGlobal Biscuits and Snacks\nSales in the quarter increased 35 percent to $862 million. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and the favorable impact of currency translation, organic sales increased 1 percent primarily driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm snacks, reflecting continued growth in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies.\nSegment operating earnings increased 23 percent to $123 million. The increase was primarily driven by the benefit from the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance.\nCampbell Fresh\nSales in the quarter increased 1 percent to $251 million primarily driven by gains in refrigerated soup. Sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages were comparable to the prior year.\nSegment operating loss was $19 million in the quarter compared to earnings of $1 million in the prior year. The earnings decline was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage reflecting higher supply chain costs and cost inflation including higher transportation and logistics costs.\nCorporate\nCorporate in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included non-cash impairment charges of $619 million related to the Campbell Fresh segment, transaction and integration costs of $72 million related to the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance, charges related to cost savings initiatives of $46 million, and a charge of $22 million related to the settlement of a legal claim. Corporate in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 included charges related to cost savings initiatives of $7 million. The remaining decrease in expenses primarily reflects the benefit of higher pension and postretirement income.\nConference Call\nCampbell will host a conference call to discuss these results today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures. Management believes that also presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of the company's historical operating results and trends in its underlying operating results, and provides transparency on how the company evaluates its business. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Organic Net Sales\nOrganic net sales are net sales excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions.

Consequently, the company believes that investors may be able to better understand its results excluding these items.\nThe following items impacted earnings: (1)\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company incurred gains of $14 million in Other expenses / (income) ($10 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.

In fiscal 2017, the company expanded these cost savings initiatives by further optimizing its supply chain network, primarily in North America, continuing to evolve its operating model to drive efficiencies, and more fully integrating its recent acquisitions. In January 2018, as part of the expanded initiatives, the company authorized additional costs to improve the operational efficiency of its thermal supply chain network in North America by closing its manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, and to optimize its information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded Restructuring charges of $14 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $30 million in Administrative expenses, $14 million in Cost of products sold, and $2 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $45 million after tax, or $.15 per share) related to these initiatives. In the nine-month period of fiscal 2018, the company recorded Restructuring charges of $49 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $68 million in Administrative expenses and $20 million in Cost of products sold, and $2 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $103 million after tax, or $.34 per share) related to these initiatives.

(3)\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company announced its intent to acquire Snyder's-Lance, Inc and incurred transaction costs of $24 million in Other expenses / (income) ($19 million after tax, or $.06 per share) associated with the acquisition.

The net impact was a tax benefit of $120 million ($.40 per share).\n(5)\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company performed interim impairment assessments within Campbell Fresh on the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business, and the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. Within the deli unit, the company revised its long-term outlook due to potential loss of refrigerated soup business with certain customers, as well as the recent performance of the business. In addition, the operating performance of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressing reporting unit was below expectations. The company revised its long-term outlook for future earnings and cash flows for each of these reporting units.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit as operating performance was well below expectations and a new leadership team of the Campbell Fresh division initiated a strategic review which led to a revised outlook for future sales, earnings, and cash flow. The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $147 million ($139 million after tax, or $.45 per share) related to intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and a non-cash impairment charge of $65 million ($41 million after tax, or $.13 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit (aggregate pre-tax impact of $212 million, $180 million after tax, or $.58 per share). The charges were included in Other expenses / (income). (6)\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded a loss of $22 million in Other expenses / (income) ($15 million after tax, or $.05 per share) from a settlement of a legal claim.\n(7)\nFor the year ended July 30, 2017, the company recorded a tax benefit of $52 million in Taxes on earnings primarily related to the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution, which resulted in the recognition of foreign exchange losses on the notes for tax purposes.
