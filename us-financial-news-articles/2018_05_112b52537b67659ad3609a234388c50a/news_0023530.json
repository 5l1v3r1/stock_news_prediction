The company filed for chapter 11 protection in March , six months after allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment were first published against Mr. Weinstein and after attempts to sell the studio outside of bankruptcy failed.\nProceeds from the sale will be used to reimburse Weinstein Co. creditors in a debt repayment plan that will need to be negotiated and later approved by the court. People familiar with the matter have said the sale proceeds are likely to produce substantial funds for alleged victims of Mr. Weinstein, including women who have pending lawsuits against the studio.\nGenerally, people with legal claims against Weinstein Co. rank lower on the bankruptcy payment priority ladder than banks that loaned the studio money on a secured basis. However, the movie studio’s complex project finances leave some assets free of bank claims and potentially available to all creditors, creditors’ lawyers have said.\nMr. Weinstein and others who owned the studio aren’t anticipated to be compensated for equity they held in the business, as is common in chapter 11.\nRelated Coverage\nNew York Attorney General Schneiderman Resigns After Abuse Allegations (May 7) Weinstein Co. Acquisition by Investor Group Is Called Off (March 6) Deal Talks to Sell Weinstein Co. Collapse After New York Attorney General Files Lawsuit (Feb. 11) Through Miramax and then The Weinstein Company, Harvey and Bob Weinstein became two of the leading forces behind the independent film movement of the 1990s -- in the process making millions of dollars and earning more than 200 Oscar nominations. WSJ's Mark Kelly reports. Lawyers representing a group of women who have brought a proposed class action lawsuit against Weinstein Co. publicly backed a rival offer from Broadway producer and former hedge fund partner Howard Kagan. That offer, submitted after a court-approved bid deadline, would have created a victims fund and provided some equity in a new business for potential class members in the lawsuit.\nWeinstein Co. said the offer from Mr. Kagan was deficient and didn’t provide as much value for the studio’s assets as Lantern’s offer, which includes the assumption of studio debt. Paul Zumbro, a bankruptcy lawyer representing the studio, said at Tuesday’s hearing the Lantern transaction provides “fair and full value for the company,” and the buyer has promised to promote a safe and inclusive workspace.\nAssets include rights to a handful of unreleased films including the historical drama “The Current War,” a library of released Weinstein Co. films and television productions, court papers say.\nNothing in the sale order shields people associated with Weinstein Co. from litigation over alleged sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein, said creditor lawyer Debra Grassgreen. Additionally, creditors are holding on to the right to seek to reclaim money paid out to Mr. Weinstein or other top-ranking insiders who collected millions from the studio in the year before it filed for bankruptcy.\nMore than 80 women have accused Mr. Weinstein of misconduct. He has admitted mistakes but denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.\nMr. Zumbro told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that the company “fully [supports] the concept of a victim’s fund, provided that it can be structured in a manner consistent with the bankruptcy law” and that determining how sale proceeds will be distributed will happen after the sale to Lantern closes.\n— Peg Brickley contributed to this article\nWrite to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:46:12.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
