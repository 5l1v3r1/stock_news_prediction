But Chennai kept him wicketless in his four overs while scoring 25.\nChennai had finished behind table toppers Hyderabad in the group stage but defeated them in the playoffs at the same venue on Tuesday. They picked up their third IPL trophy after a gap of seven years.\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T21:00:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
