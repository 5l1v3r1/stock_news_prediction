North Korea has long demanded U.S. troops be withdrawn as a condition for peace.\nBut the United States has been at pains in recent days to stress that U.S. troops were not a bargaining chip.\nU.S. national security adviser John Bolton said last week that Trump had not asked the Pentagon for options to reduce U.S. forces based in South Korea, denying a newspaper report.\nMattis said there was reason for optimism about the summit, which Trump on Wednesday disclosed would be not be held at the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, as many experts had expected.\nTrump has previously mentioned Singapore as a possible venue.\nMattis, in his Senate remarks, did not rule out that the United States could eventually examine troop levels in South Korea as part of a bilateral discussion between Washington and Seoul, potentially concurrent with talks with Pyongyang.\n“If during the negotiation this issue was to come up between our allies and us, that would be one thing - between two allies, not a matter of the negotiation with DPRK, for example,” Mattis said, using the acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the official name for North Korea.\nU.S. troops have been stationed in South Korea since the Korean War, which ended in 1953 in an armistice that left the two Koreas technically still at war.\nSouth Korea said last week that the issue of U.S. troops stationed in the South was unrelated to any future peace treaty with North Korea and that American forces should stay even if such an agreement is signed.\nReporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; editing by Franklin Paul and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:14:05.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
