EXCLUSIVE CLUB\nIn more than a century of racing at the famed speedway only three men — A.J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr and Rick Mears — have finished the 500 on Victory Lane four times and with a win on Sunday, Castroneves would become the first non-American to join that exclusive club.\nAs much joy as the Indy 500 has brought him, it has also produced plenty of heartbreak, with three runnerup finishes, including last year when he crossed 0.201 seconds behind Japan’s Takuma Sato.\n“You can see people want to be part of history, their wish is my wish, it would be a dream come true,” said Castroneves.\n“To have an opportunity to race the Indy 500 it could not be better it would be great to get another one and give the fans number four as well.”\nCastroneves is part of the powerhouse Team Penske stable which boasts an all-star lineup of IndyCar Series champions.\nAmerican Josef Newgarden (2017) Frenchman Simon Pagenaud (2016) and Australian Will Power (2014) will all be trying to give ‘The Captain’ Roger Penske a 17th trip to Victory Lane.\nPagenaud, Power and Newgarden will line up behind Carpenter while Castroneves qualified eighth and will launch his bid from the middle of row three, sandwiched between Patrick and 2008 winner Scott Dixon.\nThe king of qualifying, three times Carpenter has started from pole but there has been no hometown magic and he has cracked the top 10 only three times in 14 races.\n“It is a career defining race and something that changes your life forever,” said Carpenter.\n“It would certainly be fun to be able to be do it and celebrate with the hometown fans.” (Editing by Ian Ransom)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T03:30:49.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
