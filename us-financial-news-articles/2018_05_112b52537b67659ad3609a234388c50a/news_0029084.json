Data for March was revised to show import prices falling 0.2 percent instead of being unchanged as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.5 percent in April.\nMeanwhile, the consumer price index data rose 0.2 percent last month, below analyst expectations of a 0.3 percent increase.\nThe news lifted market expectations, easing concerns about the pace of the U.S. central bank's tightening strategy.\nThe Federal Reserve, tasked with keeping inflation around 2 percent, considers consumer pricing data when deciding whether to increase the benchmark federal funds rate. Despite the narrow CPI miss, personal consumption expenditures — the Fed's preferred inflation metric — is now near the central bank's target.\nRising inflation is a threat to Treasury prices because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments, putting upward pressure on rates.\nMeanwhile, in oil markets, Brent crude traded at around $76.89 a barrel on Monday morning, down 0.3 percent, while U.S. crude was around $70.51 a barrel, off by 0.25 percent.\nOil prices slipped away from multi-year highs on Monday, amid resistance from global players over the Donald Trump administration's sanctions against major oil exporter Iran. Energy market participants fear a sharp fall in Iranian crude supply once U.S. sanctions bite later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T12:12:55.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
