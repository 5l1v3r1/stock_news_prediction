REUTERS/Charles Platiau The headquarters of the unit in Paris has 292 staff and employees whose jobs are cut will be offered other posts in the region, according to the FO trade union. A BNP spokeswoman confirmed there would be no layoffs.\nAccording to the union, management said the move was due to the growing maturity and desire for greater independence of the 15 units that made up the bank’s international retail banking activities in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, China and the United States.\nThe FO union added that as part of the move, the human resources team in Paris will be cut to 31 from 59 jobs.\nOverall, BNP has 41,000 international retail banking employees in 15 countries.\nReporting by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T19:43:16.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
