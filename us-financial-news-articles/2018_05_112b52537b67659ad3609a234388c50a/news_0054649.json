These sales are compared to $214 million for the first quarter of 2017, or an 11% increase. Currency was the primary driver of the improvement year over year.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter was $8.2 million, compared to $5.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The significant improvement was driven by currency and lower corporate expenses.\n“While currency had a positive impact during the quarter,” said Jakob Mosser, Chief Executive Officer, “we were encouraged by several positive results, including the improvement of liquidity and the performance of the business to plan, which position us well for the quarters ahead. We remain focused on growing our top line and reducing our costs.”\nAdditional financial information may be found on www.coveris.com under the Investor Relations section.\nEARNINGS CALL\nA conference call hosted by management to discuss these financial results will be held on May 24, at 9:00 am, Eastern.
