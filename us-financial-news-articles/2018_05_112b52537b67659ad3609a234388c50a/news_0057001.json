Some U.S. farmers said they scrapped plans to plant sorghum, choosing corn instead, because China’s probe had hurt prices.

Farmers had already been reducing plantings in recent years due in part to lackluster Chinese demand.\nSince China dropped the probe, prices for the grain have spiked about 80 cents, with basis bids at around 40 cents a bushel above Chicago Board of Trade December corn CZ8 futures.\nBids for immediate deliveries of sorghum to Corpus Christi, Texas M-FOBCRP-P1, where Archer Daniels Midland Co ( ADM.N ) loads ships with the grain for export, have spiked from 22-month lows to the highest since mid-April, when trade tensions with China began to escalate.\nBids for deliveries in July M-FOBCRP-P3, when newly harvested Texas sorghum will be available, spiked to highs not seen since late January.\n“Farmers have got good prices right now, but they’re not letting go of anything,” said Guy Brady, president of Vista Exports Corp in Houston, which buys grain from farmers that is later exported. “They’re reading all this bullish stuff on China so they think the market’s going to keep going up.”\nBeijing’s temporary requirement for deposits on imports of U.S. sorghum has also left U.S. sellers and Chinese buyers nervous about striking major new deals because of the potential for another disruption in trade, traders said.\nADM has said it will take a $30 million hit to its trading profit in the second quarter due to the trade dispute over sorghum.\n“We can’t buy it and we’re afraid to sell it,” Brady said. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty.” Additional reporting by Michael Hirtzer in Chicago; editing by Richard Valdmanis and James Dalgleish", "external_links": ["https://tmsnrt.rs/2s8Pyer"], "published": "2018-05-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T09:04:07.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
