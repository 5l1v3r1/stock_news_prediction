De facto, there is one owner of Polish energy companies,” Bando told Reuters.\nURE said that the share of Poland’s three biggest power companies - PGE, Enea and Tauron - in the volume of electricity fed into the grid rose in 2017 by 14 percentage points year-on-year to 69 percent.\n“Concentration in the Polish energy sector is striking in terms of ratios and I think questions from the European Commission may come up in relation to this issue,” he added.\nThe EC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe opinion of the energy market regulator on a merger needs to be taken into account by the antimonopoly office when it approves or rejects a planned takeover.\nReporting by Agnieszka Barteczko and Anna Koper, Editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:15:34.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
