Fulvio Conti, a former TIM manager and the first name on Elliott’s slate, is seen as front-runner to become chairman, sources close to the matter have said.\nPrevious executive chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine - also Vivendi’s CEO - was one of the board members that resigned in March, triggering the full board reshuffle.\nThough close to Vivendi, Genish is respected by Elliott, the Italian government and investors. The big question is whether the 58-year-old, who has been at the helm since September and presented a three-year business plan in March, will stay on.\n“We believe this is in the interest of Vivendi as well as the market’s; hence, we are optimistic on his staying, at least in the short term, to test his fit with the new board,” Deutsche Bank, which has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, said in a note.\nGenish has said he will only continue if the new board backs his plan, which focuses on a digital transformation of the company, fixing its finances and getting back an investment grade credit rating.\nBeyond asking for a governance shake-up, Elliott had called for the spin-off and partial sale of TIM’s soon-to-be-created network company, a conversion of savings shares, a return to dividends and potential asset sales - all moves TIM management had called premature, unfeasible and financially risky.\nBut recently the U.S. hedge fund has toned down its requests, saying it would be up to the new board and management to decide whether and when to carry out any such initiatives.\nGenish sent a letter to managers after Friday’s vote, saying it had “not changed the direction in which we are travelling”.\nThe Israeli-born executive said he had since received calls from top executives at Elliott and Vivendi reaffirming their support of the current management team and its plan.\n“I expect the new board to do the same when we meet on Monday. We are on the right path, with the right team and the right backing,” he wrote, according to a copy of the document reviewed by Reuters.\nElliott launched its campaign to loosen Vivendi’s grip over TIM in March. It built a stake of 9 percent to try to shake up the way Vivendi - which owns 24 percent - runs it.\nElliott accused Vivendi, backed by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, of serving its own interests, while the French group said Elliott was only after short-term financial gains.\nAfter becoming a shareholder in 2015, Vivendi gradually tightened its grip on TIM, appointing the majority of its board last year - all in the name of Bollore’s stated ambition of building a southern European media powerhouse.\nThe hands-on approach led to friction with politicians in Rome, concerned about a nationally important asset.\nFive of Vivendi’s candidates, including de Puyfontaine, will be on the board, so the two sides will have to find a way to work together to help the company slash debt and become more competitive.\nVivendi has said it will fight to ensure Elliott’s candidates “don’t push for the break-up of TIM”.\nTIM shares were up 1.6 percent at 1300 GMT. The stock has gained nearly 20 percent since Elliott launched its campaign in early March.
