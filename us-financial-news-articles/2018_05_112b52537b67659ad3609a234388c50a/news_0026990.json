(NASDAQ:DNLI), a biopharmaceutical company developing a broad portfolio of therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Denali reported a net loss of $23.7 million, compared with a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $21.3 million.\nCollaboration Revenue was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, with no revenue recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to revenue recognized under the Option and Collaboration Agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, which was entered into in January 2018.\nTotal research and development expenses were $20.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $18.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, including non-cash stock-based compensation of $1.7 million and $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in total research and development expenses of $2.3 million was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related expenses, including stock-based compensation, and an increase in lab consumable costs and facilities related expenses. The main drivers of these increases are an increase in research and development headcount and the increased value of Denali's common stock.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, including non-cash stock-based compensation of $1.2 million and $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in total general and administrative expenses of $2.3 million was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related expenses, including stock-based compensation, and an increase in legal and professional service expenses. The main drivers of these increases are an increase in general and administrative headcount and the increased value of Denali's common stock, as well as the increased professional services required as a public company.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $592.8 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $467.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase of $125.8 million was primarily attributable to $155.0 million in cash received related to the Option and Collaboration Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement with Takeda.\nAbout Denali Therapeutics\nDenali is a biopharmaceutical company developing a broad portfolio of therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases.
