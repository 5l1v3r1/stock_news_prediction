The long ball, Thompson’s third of the season, allowed the White Sox to snap a four-game losing streak as they opened a six-game, seven-day homestand.\nNate Jones (2-0), the fifth Chicago pitcher, garnered the win by retiring Brian Dozier, the only batter he faced, in the top of the ninth.\nNeither White Sox starter Reynaldo Lopez (five runs, four of them earned, on six hits in 6 2/3 innings) nor Minnesota starter Jake Odorizzi (5 1/3 innings, five runs, three of them earned on six hits) was involved in the decision.\nThe Twins started the scoring in the third as Logan Morrison came home on a passed ball by Omar Narvaez. Jason Castro then lofted a sacrifice fly to right field to drive home Gregorio Petit and stake Minnesota to a 2-0 lead.\nChicago cut the deficit in half in the bottom of the inning when Yolmer Sanchez’s groundout allowed Adam Engel to score from third base.\nThe Twins seemingly took control in the fourth, scoring three times on a RBI double by Eddie Rosario and a two-run home run by Morrison.\nHowever, the White Sox responded, clawing to within 5-3 in the bottom of the frame on a two-run home run over the right-center-field fence by Daniel Palka. Chicago then scored a run in the fifth when Sanchez’s single plated Narvaez.\nThe White Sox tied the game in the sixth as Matt Davidson’s double and an error by Twins right fielder Robbie Grossman allowed Jose Abreu to score.\nThe Twins will send right-hander Jose Berrios (2-3, 3.63 ERA) to the mound on Friday against Chicago right-hander Carson Fulmer (2-1, 4.32).\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:12:49.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
