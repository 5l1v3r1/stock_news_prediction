England-based luxury wedding planner Aimee Dunne tells CNBC Make It that expenses like food and beverage, the dress, flowers and a glass marquee for the reception will cost about $2.7 million (£2 million). That's 73 times the cost of the average wedding in the U.K.\nAs for who's picking up the tab, the royal family announced that it will pay for the \"core aspects of the wedding,\" which include the \"church service, the associated music, flowers, decorations and the reception afterwards.\"\nThe whopping security costs, however, are expected to be paid for largely by taxpayers. For the 2011 marriage of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, the English public contributed an estimated $27 million , which allowed for thousands of extra police officers at the event.\nThe bride will likely be contributing, too: Markle is reportedly expected to pay for her six-figure wedding dress herself .\nLike this story?
