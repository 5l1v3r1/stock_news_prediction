He will be replaced in an acting capacity by the head of the department’s Iran team, the Vienna-based IAEA said.\n“Mr Tero Varjoranta has resigned effective 11 May 2018,” an IAEA spokesman said. “The director general has appointed Mr Massimo Aparo, acting director, Office for Verification in Iran, as acting deputy director general and head of the Department of Safeguards, effective immediately.”\nThe accord signed by Iran and major powers in 2015 imposed strict limits on Iran’s atomic activities to help ensure they are not put to developing nuclear bombs in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions against Tehran.\nThe IAEA is policing those restrictions and said on Wednesday, the day after Trump’s announcement, that Iran was still implementing its commitments under the deal.\nThe U.N. watchdog has also repeatedly defended the landmark agreement, saying it is a gain for nuclear verification.\n“The agency’s safeguards activities will continue to be carried out in a highly professional manner,” the spokesman said.\nAsked why Varjoranta had resigned, he said: “The agency cannot comment on personnel matters, which are confidential.” IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano plans to appoint a permanent replacement as soon as possible, he added.\nReporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:29:09.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
