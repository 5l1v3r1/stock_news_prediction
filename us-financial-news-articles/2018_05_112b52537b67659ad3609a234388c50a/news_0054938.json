Her woes continued into the second, and she soon found herself battling to stay in the match at 5-3 down.\nFew would have foreseen the turnaround that was to follow.\nCibulkova’s serve finally surfaced and she held to draw within a game of her opponent, while Buzarnescu’s composure deserted her as she made a series of errors that allowed the Slovak to break and draw level at 5-5.\nThe set went to a tiebreak and Cibulkova scrapped ferociously to force the deciding set, before coasting to victory in clinical style, winning 71 percent of her first serves and making only three unforced errors in the final set.\nThird seed Pavlyuchenkova progressed after Barty retired while trailing the Russian 6-4 1-0.
