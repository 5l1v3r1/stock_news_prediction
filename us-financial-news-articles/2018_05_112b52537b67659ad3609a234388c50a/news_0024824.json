(\"MDC Partners\" or the \"Company\") today announced three months ended March 31, 2018.\nScott Kauffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MDC Partners, said, \"While the prospects for the business in 2018 were strong coming into the year, the performance in March and April was disappointing. Apart from the impact of the new accounting rules, the combination of select client cut backs and a slower conversion of our new business pipeline has led us to update our 2018 financial targets. The pipeline of new business opportunities is substantial and our partner agencies are well positioned which we expect will support a return to better top line growth in the coming quarters.\"\nDavid Doft, Chief Financial Officer of MDC Partners, said, \"Given the significant costs related to the adoption of ASC 606, our investments in growth initiatives, combined with elevated severance, we expected a muted first quarter performance from a profitability standpoint. The first quarter was also impacted by a shift in timing of revenue, which had a direct impact on the bottom line. Even with this expectation, the underlying performance is leading us to update our outlook to incorporate the increased risk that has emerged. We now expect organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% and 0 to 40 basis points of margin expansion, including a 60 basis points favorable impact on our margins from the accounting change that was not in our initial expectation.\"\nAdoption of ASC 606\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606). In accordance with the new revenue accounting standard, we were required to change certain aspects of our accounting policy as it relates to performance incentives, non-refundable retainer fees, and certain third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket costs. ASC 606 was applied using the modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect of the initial adoption being recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018 for contracts that were not completed as of that date, and then we report all future periods under the new policy. Comparative prior periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the historical accounting standards and policies in effect for those periods.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 606, our first quarter 2018 financial performance is not directly comparable with last year. We have therefore provided additional disclosure to assist investors in reconciling the two accounting standards, including updating the definition of the Non-GAAP metric Organic Revenue to exclude the impact of the change in accounting standard and the provision of additional schedules which shows the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on our GAAP and Non-GAAP performance metrics. See schedules 2 and 3.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $327.0 million versus $344.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decline in revenue was primarily due the adoption of ASC 606, which reduced revenue by $21.3 million, or 6.2%. The effect of foreign exchange was positive 1.6%, the impact of non-GAAP acquisitions (dispositions), net was negative 1.5%, and organic revenue growth was 1.0%. Organic revenue growth was favorably impacted by 340 basis points from increased billable pass-through costs incurred on clients' behalf from certain of our partner firms acting as principal.\nNet loss attributable to MDC Partners common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $31.4 million versus a loss of $11.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted loss per share attributable to MDC Partners common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was ($0.56) versus a loss of ($0.21) per share for the first quarter of 2017. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 was an increase in net loss attributable to MDC Partners common shareholders of $4.4 million, or $0.08 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.8 million versus $35.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 was a reduction of $6.1 million. Excluding the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million with margins of 4.0%.\nFinancial Outlook\n2018 financial guidance is revised as follows:\n2018 Outlook Commentary *\nOrganic Revenue Growth\nWe expect 1-3% growth in organic revenue (versus approximately 4% growth previously), whose definition now excludes the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 in the reconciliation of reported revenue.\nPass-through and Out-of-Pocket Costs\nThe adoption of ASC 606 resulted in certain client contracts previously being accounted for as principal, now being accounted for as agent. This results in a reduction in full year gross revenue of approximately $65 million with a corresponding reduction in direct costs, with no impact on profit.\nForeign Exchange Impact, net\nAssuming currency rates remain where they are, and based on our most recent projections, the net impact of foreign exchange is expected to be positive by approximately 50 basis points versus 100 basis points previously.\nImpact of Non-GAAP Acquisitions (Dispositions), net\nOur current expectations are that the impact of acquisitions, net of disposition activity, will increase revenue by approximately 80 basis points.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe expect margins to be flat to 40 basis points of expansion versus approximately 20 basis points expansion previously. Our revised outlook incorporates an approximately 60 basis point benefit from the shift from gross to net revenue accounting related to certain client contracts, whereas our prior outlook did not. Our revised outlook therefore implies an approximately 60 basis point reduction from our prior outlook, excluding the impact from the accounting change.\n* The Company has excluded a quantitative reconciliation with respect to the Company's 2018 guidance under the \"unreasonable efforts\" exception in item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K.\nConference Call\nManagement on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. (ET) to discuss results.

Such non-GAAP financial measures include the following:\n(1) Organic Revenue: \"Organic revenue growth\" and \"organic revenue decline\" refer to the positive or negative results, respectively, of subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition (disposition) components from total revenue growth, excluding the impact of adopting ASC 606. The acquisition (disposition) component is calculated by aggregating prior period revenue for any acquired businesses, less the prior period revenue of any businesses that were disposed of during the current period. The organic revenue growth (decline) component reflects the constant currency impact of (a) the change in revenue of the partner firms which the Company has held throughout each of the comparable periods presented, and (b) \"non-GAAP acquisitions (dispositions), net\". Non-GAAP acquisitions (dispositions), net consists of (i) for acquisitions during the current year, the revenue effect from such acquisition as if the acquisition had been owned during the equivalent period in the prior year and (ii) for acquisitions during the previous year, the revenue effect from such acquisitions as if they had been owned during that entire year (or same period as the current reportable period), taking into account their respective pre-acquisition revenues for the applicable periods, and (iii) for dispositions, the revenue effect from such disposition as if they had been disposed of during the equivalent period in the prior year.\n(2) Net New Business: Estimate of annualized revenue for new wins less annualized revenue for losses incurred in the period.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents operating profit plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred acquisition consideration adjustments, distributions from non-consolidated affiliates, and other items.\nIncluded in this earnings release are tables reconciling MDC Partners' reported results to arrive at certain of these non-GAAP financial measures. We are unable to reconcile our projected 2018 organic revenue growth to the corresponding GAAP measure because we are unable to predict the 2018 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, dispositions, or other potential changes. We are unable to reconcile our projected 2018 increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin to the corresponding GAAP measure because the amount and timing of many future charges that impact these measures (such as amortization of future acquired intangible assets, foreign exchange transaction gains or losses, impairment charges, provision or benefit for income taxes, and certain assumptions used in the calculation of deferred acquisition consideration) are variable, uncertain, or out of our control and therefore cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort, if at all. As a result, we are unable to provide reconciliations of these measures. In addition, we believe such reconciliations could imply a degree of precision that might be confusing or misleading to investors.\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the \"safe harbor\" created by those sections. Statements in this press release that are not historical facts, including without limitation statements about the Company's beliefs and expectations, earnings guidance, recent business and economic trends, potential acquisitions, and estimates of amounts for redeemable noncontrolling interests and deferred acquisition consideration, constitute . Words such as \"estimates\", \"expects\", \"contemplates\", \"will\", \"anticipates\", \"projects\", \"plans\", \"intends\", \"believes\", \"forecasts\", \"may\", \"should\", and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify . These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and are subject to change based on a number of factors, including those outlined in this section. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events, if any.\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any . Such risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\nrisks associated with severe effects of international, national and regional economic conditions; the Company's ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients; the spending patterns and financial success of the Company's clients; the Company's ability to retain and attract key employees; the Company's ability to remain in compliance with its debt agreements and the Company's ability to finance its contingent payment obligations when due and payable, including but not limited to those relating to redeemable noncontrolling interests and deferred acquisition consideration; the successful completion and integration of acquisitions which complement and expand the Company's business capabilities, and the potential impact of one or more asset sales; foreign currency fluctuations; and risks associated with the ongoing Canadian class litigation claim.\nThe Company's business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the marketing communications services industry. The Company intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations, from borrowings under its credit facility and through incurrence of bridge or other debt financing, any of which may increase the Company's leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on existing shareholders proportionate ownership. At any given time, the Company may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by the Company. Although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of the Company's securities.\nInvestors should carefully consider these risk factors and the additional risk factors outlined in more detail in the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and in the Company's other SEC filings.\nSCHEDULE 1\nMDC PARTNERS INC.\nUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(US$ in 000s, except share and per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 (1)\n2017\nRevenue\n$ 326,968\n$ 344,700\nOperating expenses:\nCost of services sold\n243,030\n237,563\nOffice and general expenses\n83,879\n87,840\nDepreciation and amortization\n12,375\n10,898\nOther asset impairment\n2,317\n-\n341,601\n336,301\nOperating profit (loss)\n(14,633)\n8,399\nOther income (expense):\nOther, net\n(6,219)\n2,567\nInterest expense and finance charges\n(16,231)\n(16,768)\nInterest income\n148\n227\n(22,302)\n(13,974)\nLoss before income taxes and equity in earnings of non-consolidated affiliates\n(36,935)\n(5,575)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(8,330)\n3,969\nLoss before equity in earnings of non-consolidated affiliates\n(28,605)\n(9,544)\nEquity in earings (losses) of non-consolidated affiliates\n86\n(139)\nNet loss\n(28,519)\n(9,683)\nNet income attributable to the noncontrolling interests\n(897)\n(883)\nNet loss attributable to MDC Partners Inc.\n(29,416)\n(10,566)\nAccretion on convertible preference shares\n(2,027)\n(507)\nNet loss attributable to MDC Partners Inc. common shareholders\n$ (31,443)\n$ (11,073)\nLoss per common share:\nBasic and diluted:\nNet loss attributable to MDC Partners Inc. common shareholders\n$ (0.56)\n$ (0.21)\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding:\nBasic and diluted\n56,415,042\n52,998,244\n(1) Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606). ASC 606 was applied using the modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect of the initial adoption being recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018. As a result, comparative prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC 605 \"Revenue Recognition\" (ASC 605). For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the adoption of ASC 606 reduced revenue by $21.3 million, increased operating loss by $6.1 million, and increased Net loss attributable to MDC Partners common shareholders by $4.4 million, or $0.08 per share. As required, we have provided a reconciliation of the current presentation under ASC 606 to the prior presentation under ASC 605 in this release in Schedule 2.\nSCHEDULE 2\nMDC PARTNERS INC.\nUNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF COMPONENTS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(US$ in 000s, except percentages)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nAs Reported\nAdjustments\nAdjusted to Exclude\nthe Impact of\nAdoption of ASC 606\nRevenue\n$ 326,968\n$ 21,276\n$ 348,244\nCosts of services sold\n243,030\n15,197\n258,227\nOperating loss\n(14,633)\n6,079\n(8,554)\nNet loss attributable to MDC Partners, Inc. common shareholders\n(31,443)\n4,436\n(27,007)\nLoss per common share - basic and diluted\n(0.56)\n0.08\n(0.48)\nOrganic Revenue Growth\n1.0%\n-\n1.0%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 7,824\n$ 6,079\n$ 13,903\nmargin\n2.4%\n4.0%\n* The table above summarizes the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on our US GAAP and non-GAAP performance metrics.\nNote: Actuals may not foot due to rounding.\nSCHEDULE 3\nMDC PARTNERS INC.\nUNAUDITED REVENUE RECONCILIATION\n(US$ in 000s, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended\nRevenue $\n% Change\nMarch 31, 2017 as reported under ASC 605\n$ 344,700\nOrganic revenue growth (1)\n3,296\n1.0%\nNon-GAAP acquisitions (dispositions), net\n(5,261)\n(1.5%)\nForeign exchange impact\n5,509\n1.6%\nImpact of adoption of ASC 606 (2)\n(21,276)\n(6.2%)\nTotal change\n(17,732)\n(5.1%)\nMarch 31, 2018 as reported under ASC 606\n$ 326,968\n(1) \"Organic revenue growth\" and \"organic revenue decline\" refer to the positive or negative results, respectively, of subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition (disposition) components from total revenue growth, excluding the impact of adopting ASC 606. The acquisition (disposition) component is calculated by aggregating prior period revenue for any acquired businesses, less the prior period revenue of any businesses that were disposed of during the current period. The organic revenue growth (decline) component reflects the constant currency impact of (a) the change in revenue of the partner firms which the Company has held throughout each of the comparable periods presented, and (b) \"non-GAAP acquisitions (dispositions), net\". Non-GAAP acquisitions (dispositions), net consists of (i) for acquisitions during the current year, the revenue effect from such acquisition as if the acquisition had been owned during the equivalent period in the prior year and (ii) for acquisitions during the previous year, the revenue effect from such acquisitions as if they had been owned during that entire year (or same period as the current reportable period), taking into account their respective pre-acquisition revenues for the applicable periods, and (iii) for dispositions, the revenue effect from such disposition as if they had been disposed of during the equivalent period in the prior year.\n(2) In accordance with the adoption of ASC 606, we were required to change certain aspects of our revenue recognition accounting policy as it relates to performance incentives, retainer fees, and certain third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket costs. Under the prior guidelines, performance incentives were recognized in revenue when specific quantitative goals were achieved, or when the Company's performance against qualitative goals was determined by the client. Under ASC 606, the Company now estimates the amount of the incentive that will be earned at the inception of the contract and recognizes such incentive over the term of the contract. Additionally, previously, fees for non-refundable retainers were generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the specific customer arrangement. Under ASC 606, an input method is typically used to measure progress and recognize revenue for these types of arrangements. Finally, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in certain client arrangements previously being accounted for as principal, now being accounted for as agent.
