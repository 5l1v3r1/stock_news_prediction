The proposal was subsequently withdrawn by the buyer, it said.\nThe board “concluded that the proposal undervalues SeaLink and that the board would not be in a position to recommend the proposal to its shareholders,” SeaLink said.\nShares of the company jumped to a six-month high of A$4.28 after the announcement, while the broader market was up 0.2 percent.\nReporting by Sumeet Gaikwad in Bengaluru; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:09:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
