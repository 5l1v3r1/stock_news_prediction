It takes a pro-government stance.\nGanapathy is the managing director of Asia Public Relations Consultants Sdn Bhd, headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, whose website referred to “Cambodia and Hun Sen’s entry into the government seat” as one of its projects.\nWhen a Reuters journalist visited the firm’s office in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, on Tuesday, the door was locked and nobody responded to several rings on the doorbell.\nA representative for the firm declined on Tuesday to comment to Reuters on the sale, adding that Ganapathy was travelling abroad for the next two weeks.
