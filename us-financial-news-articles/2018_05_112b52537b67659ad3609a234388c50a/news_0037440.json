The 20-year yield was 1 basis point higher at 0.540 percent.\nMarket response was limited to data that showed Japanâ€™s gross domestic product (GDP) shrank over January-March after eight straight quarters of growth.\nThe BOJ on Wednesday offered to buy 260 billion yen of 10- to 40-year JGBs as part of its regular debt-purchasing scheme.\nPrices of U.S. Treasuries fell and their benchmark yield shot to a seven-year high overnight as strong U.S. retail sales data added to the bearish market mood.
