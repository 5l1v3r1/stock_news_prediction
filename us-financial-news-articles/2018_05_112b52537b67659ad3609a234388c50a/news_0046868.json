I think I need couple more weeks to get used to playing on clay, as more damage to my wrist, play more spin.\n“But it’s not too bad.”\nPerhaps as a result, Nishikori’s claycourt season has been hit so far despite the impressive showing at the Monte Carlo Masters, which saw him lose to 11-times champion Rafael Nadal in the final.\nDays after that loss to Nadal, Nishikori retired hurt during his first match in Barcelona before losing in the second round to Novak Djokovic in Madrid and falling to the same opponent in the quarter-finals in Rome.\nAfter losing to Djokovic for the second time in 10 days, Nishikori admitted “the third set was close, but I think he played a little better than me”.\nThat sentiment could describe Nishikori’s entire career of being close but ultimately not having the quality in the latter stages to trouble the likes of Djokovic and Nadal.\nNishikori has beaten overwhelming Roland Garros favorite Nadal on two occasions - including to claim Olympic bronze at Rio 2016 - but never on clay.\nTwice a quarter-finalist at Roland Garros - most recently last year when he lost to Andy Murray – Nishikori will be hoping to go at least one stage further this time around as he looks to make a good career great.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant,; Editing by Nick Mulvenney/Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:51:02.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
