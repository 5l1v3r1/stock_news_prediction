ADNOC Distribution's deputy CEO said the latest earnings would allow the company to invest and expand.\n\"Based on the first-quarter results, a strong set of financial results, it gives us a really good foundation for the future,\" Carey said.\nADNOC Distribution has 360 fuel retail sites in the UAE and 235 convenience stores, giving it a 67 percent retail market share. In April, the company secured a trade license to operate in Saudi Arabia.\nCarey said the company was \"investing heavily\" in the technology it uses and the customer experience, including a 100 million UAE dirham investment in technology at its stations.\n\"We just opened a partnership with Géant (an UAE-based retailer) in our convenience store and we talked about delivering three new stations in Dubai this year,\" he said.\nADNOC Distribution manages its parent company's — the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company — downstream operations (the processing and distribution of crude oil and gas products).\nAt the weekend, the CEO of parent group ADNOC unveiled plans to invest $45 billion over the next five years to establish a leading role in the global downstream sector .\n\"ADNOC continues to be focused on upstream, yet this time around ADNOC will expand its business focus into downstream by creating many multi-billion dollar opportunities in the downstream.
