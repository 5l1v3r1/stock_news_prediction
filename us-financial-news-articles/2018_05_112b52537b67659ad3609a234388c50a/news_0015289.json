(Nasdaq: PMTS; TSX: PMTS) (“CPI Card Group” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nScott Scheirman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CPI, stated, “Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and highlighted by 5% year-over-year revenue growth reflecting strong performance in Prepaid and continued growth of our emerging products and solutions, somewhat offset by the impact of the challenging U.S. debit and credit card manufacturing environment. During the first quarter, we continued to win new business with our existing customers, added new customers, and capitalized on opportunities to expand into new client verticals. We are seeing good momentum in early 2018 in support of our strategic priorities, including recent significant portfolio wins with two of our large Prepaid customers as well as growth of our instant issuance and premium card offerings. We remain intensely focused on our strategy of deep customer focus, providing market-leading quality products and customer service, a market competitive business model, and continuous innovation.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Financial Highlights (results consistent with May 2, 2018 preannouncement)\nNet sales were $59.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 5% from the first quarter of 2017. Loss from operations was $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a loss from operations of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $7.3 million, or a loss of $0.65 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.5 million, or a loss of $0.40 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.7 million, compared with $3.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting revenue growth and ongoing efficiency initiatives offset primarily by the impact of absorption of overhead costs from lower volumes, softness in the U.K. Limited segment, and investments to enhance our products and solutions. Adjusted Net Loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $5.2 million, or a loss of $0.47 per diluted share, compared with Adjusted Net Loss of $3.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nAll earnings per share amounts reflect the one-for-five reverse stock split which occurred in December 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Information\nU.S. Debit and Credit:\nNet sales were $37.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 6.5% from the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in U.S. Debit and Credit segment net sales was driven predominantly by a decline in the number of cards sold in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2017 and lower EMV® card average selling prices, partially offset by growth in our emerging products and solutions.\nU.S. Prepaid Debit:\nNet sales were $15.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 63.3% from the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in U.S. Prepaid Debit segment net sales was driven primarily by additional volumes from recent client portfolio wins.\nU.K. Limited:\nNet sales were $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 24.6% from the first quarter of 2017. The lower net sales are a result of softness in the U.K. retail sector and a decline in sales relating to certain customers, partially offset by positive effects of foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, U.K. Limited segment net sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 32.9% compared with the prior year.\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow, Liquidity\nCash used in operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.8 million, and capital expenditures totaled $1.1 million. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2018 was a use of $2.9 million.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $20.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, and an undrawn $40.0 million revolving credit facility, of which $20.0 million was available for borrowing.\nTotal debt principal outstanding, comprised of the Company’s First Lien Term Loan, was $312.5 million at March 31, 2018, unchanged from December 31, 2017. Net of debt issuance costs and discount, recorded debt was $304.4 million as of March 31, 2018. The Company’s First Lien Term Loan matures on August 17, 2022 and includes no financial covenants.\nLillian Etzkorn, Chief Financial Officer, stated, “Our first quarter financial results were in-line with our expectations. We generated revenue growth of 5% year-over-year driven primarily by our Prepaid Debit segment and emerging products and solutions. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 million in the first quarter reflects our top-line growth and ongoing efficiency initiatives, offset primarily by the impact of absorption of overhead costs from lower volumes, weaker U.K. Limited results, and investments to enhance our products and solutions. We continue to believe that we have adequate cash and liquidity to support our business plan.”\nEMV® is a registered trademark or trademark of EMVCo LLC in the United States and other countries.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release: Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Constant Currency. These non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by management in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis between fiscal periods. We believe that these financial measures are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and our peers. Management also believes that these measures are useful to investors in their analysis of our results of operations and provide improved comparability between fiscal periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in Exhibit E to this press release.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets, litigation and related charges incurred in connection with certain patent and shareholder litigation, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, and other non-operational, non-cash or non-recurring items, net of their income tax impact. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, a 21% tax rate is used to calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share. We believe that Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share are useful in assessing our financial performance by excluding items that are not indicative of our core operating performance or that may obscure trends useful in evaluating our results of operations.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of performance, and it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. EBITDA is also presented and compared by analysts and investors in evaluating our ability to meet debt service obligations. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently. EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net (loss) income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA is calculated before recurring cash charges, including interest expense and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for litigation and related charges incurred in connection with certain patent and shareholder litigation, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, foreign currency gain or loss, and other items that are unusual in nature, infrequently occurring or not considered part of our core operations, as set forth in the reconciliation on Exhibit E. Adjusted EBITDA is also a defined term in our existing credit agreement, which generally conforms to the definition above, and impacts certain credit measures and compliance targets within the credit agreement. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors, excluding non-operational, non-cash or non-recurring losses or gains. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (b) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; (d) tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; (e) any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; or (f) the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we and the lenders under our credit agreement may not consider indicative of our ongoing operations. In particular, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add back certain non-cash, non-operating or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net (loss) income, even though these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict and can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results.\nIn addition, certain of these expenses can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. Further, although not included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, the measure may at times allow us to add estimated cost savings and operating synergies related to operational changes ranging from acquisitions to dispositions to restructurings and/or exclude one-time transition expenditures that we anticipate we will need to incur to realize cost savings before such savings have occurred. Further, management and various investors use the ratio of total debt less cash to Adjusted EBITDA, or \"net debt leverage\", as a measure of our financial strength and ability to incur incremental indebtedness when making key investment decisions and evaluating us against peers.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, and we use this metric in analyzing our ability to service and repay our debt. However, this measure does not represent funds available for investment or other discretionary uses since it does not deduct cash used to service our debt.\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency results show our current period operating results as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained the same as those in effect in the prior year period. We present certain constant currency results to facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results.\nAbout CPI Card Group Inc.\nCPI Card Group is a leading provider in payment card production and related services, offering a single source for credit, debit and prepaid debit cards, including EMV chip, personalization, instant issuance, fulfillment and mobile payment services.

As a result of this realignment, our CPI on Demand business operations have been moved from U.S. Prepaid Debit into the U.S. Debit and Credit reporting segment, consistent with the other related personalization operations.
