The Fire are 3-5-2.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Higuain forcefully converted the penalty after defender Kevin Ellis pulled Zardes down by the back of his jersey. The goal was Higuain’s third of the season and 51st in his MLS career, of which 18 have been via penalties.\nZardes made it 2-0 with an easy tap-in. Niko Hansen — who came on as a substitute in the 10th minute to replace an injured Pedro Santos — raced down the right sideline from midfield, then dropped a pass to the 6-yard box as he reached the end line.\nThe advantage became 3-0 with Zardes’ strike from the top of the penalty area. His eight goals, one more than Atlanta United’s Josef Martinez, are second-most in his career to the 16 he scored for the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2014. He had two goals in 24 games for LA last season.\nWith each team playing for the third time in eight days, there were some notable omissions to the lineup. Crew captain Wil Trapp did not start or play, but the midfielder was dressed on the bench. Chicago midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger did not make the trip after playing 180 minutes the past two matches.\nThe Crew play at New England on May 19. The Fire host the Houston Dynamo on May 20.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T06:12:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
