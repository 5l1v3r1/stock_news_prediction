When the Italian-born, Jewish artist's nudes were unveiled at a Paris gallery, police demanded that it be shut down, offended by the unflinching strokes of his oil brush that thrust art's nude figure into the modern era.\nIn the past half-dozen years, prices for Modigliani's works have soared, from $26 million the current owner paid for \"Nu couche (sur le cote gauche)\" in 2003 to as much as $170 million.\nPicasso's \"Le Repos,\" an image of his lover and \"golden muse,\" Marie-Therese Walter, sold for $40 million.
