This is up from our prior range of $581 to $589 million and annual growth of 25% to 27%. Raising total revenue range to $638 to $647 million, representing annual growth of 27% to 28%. This is up from our prior range of $629 to $639 million and annual growth of 25% to 27%. Raising GAAP operating margin range to (4.0%) to (3.4%), up from the prior range of (4.5%) to (3.5%). Raising non-GAAP operating margin range to 8.1% to 8.3%, up from the prior range of 7.8% to 8.2%. Raising non-GAAP EPS range to $0.61 to $0.65 based on 86.0 million fully diluted shares. This is up from our prior range of $0.56 to $0.60.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance:\nSoftware subscriptions revenue range of $142.5 to $143.5 million, representing annual growth of 28% to 29% Total revenue range of $154.5 to $156.5 million, representing annual growth of 29% to 31% GAAP operating margin range of (5.3%) and (4.3%), and Non-GAAP operating margin range of 7.5% and 8.0% Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.14 to $0.16 based on 85.0 million fully diluted shares\nFor a reconciliation of our forecasted non-GAAP operating margin, see “Reconciliation of Forecasted Operating Margin GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.” We have not reconciled our forecasted non-GAAP EPS to GAAP EPS because we do not provide guidance on it. We do not provide guidance on forecasted GAAP EPS because of the inherent uncertainty and complexity involved in forecasting the intercompany remeasurement gain (loss), which could be a significant reconciling item between the non-GAAP and respective GAAP measure. The intercompany remeasurement gain (loss) is affected by the movement in various exchange rates relative to the USD, which is difficult to predict and subject to constant change. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Details:\nWhat: RingCentral financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and outlook for the second quarter and full year of 2018.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, which could cause actual results to expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to in any forward-looking statements are: our ability to grow at our expected rate of growth; our ability to add and retain larger and enterprise customers and enter new geographies and markets; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved versions of our services; our ability to compete successfully against existing and new competitors; our ability to enter into and maintain relationships with carriers and other resellers; our ability to manage our expenses and growth; and general market, political, economic, and business conditions, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\nAll forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to RingCentral as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, to review or confirm analysts’ expectations, or to provide interim reports or updates on the progress of the current financial quarter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur reported financial results and financial outlook include certain Non-GAAP financial measures, including Non-GAAP software subscriptions gross margin, Non-GAAP other gross margin, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP operating income (loss), Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. Non-GAAP software subscriptions gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP subscriptions gross profit divided by GAAP subscriptions revenue. Non-GAAP other gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP other gross profit divided by GAAP other revenue. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) excluding share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition intangibles, and acquisition related matters. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income (loss) divided by total GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation, intercompany remeasurement gains or losses, acquisition related matters, amortization of acquisition intangibles, non-cash interest expense associated with amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes and the related income tax effect of these adjustments.\nNon-GAAP diluted shares outstanding include the impact on shares used in per share calculations of our outstanding capped call transactions. Our outstanding capped call transactions are anti-dilutive in GAAP earnings per share but are expected to mitigate the dilutive effect of our convertible notes and therefore will be included in the calculations of non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding.\nWe have included Non-GAAP software subscriptions gross margin, Non-GAAP other gross margin, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share in this press release because they are key measures used by us to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Non-GAAP software subscriptions gross margin, Non-GAAP other gross margin, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP net income (loss), and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share provide useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business.\nAlthough Non-GAAP software subscriptions gross margin, Non-GAAP other gross margin, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP net income (loss), and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, are frequently used by investors in their evaluations of companies, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered alongside other financial performance measures.\nReconciliations of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\nOther Measures\nOur reported results also include our annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions, RingCentral Office® annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions, enterprise annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions and net monthly subscriptions dollar retention. We define our annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions as our monthly recurring subscriptions multiplied by 12. Our monthly recurring subscriptions equal the monthly value of all recurring charges in effect at the end of a given month. We believe this metric is a leading indicator of our anticipated subscriptions revenue. We calculate our RingCentral Office® annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions in the same manner as we calculate our annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions, except that only customer subscriptions from RingCentral Office® customers are included when determining monthly recurring subscriptions for the purposes of calculating this key business metric. We define Dollar Net Change as the quotient of (i) the difference of our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the end of a period minus our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the beginning of a period minus our Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the end of the period from new customers we added during the period, (ii) all divided by the number of months in the period. We define our Average Monthly Recurring Subscriptions as the average of the Monthly Recurring Subscriptions at the beginning and end of the measurement period.\nTABLE 1\nRINGCENTRAL, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited, in thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017\n*As Adjusted Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 554,963 $ 181,192 Accounts receivable, net 55,379 46,690 Deferred sales commission costs $ 16,649 $ 15,424 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 24,118 21,512 Total current assets 651,109 264,818 Property and equipment, net 50,131 43,298 Deferred sales commission costs, noncurrent 40,140 37,871 Goodwill 9,393 9,393 Acquired intangibles, net 22,377 1,462 Other assets 2,328 2,972 Total assets $ 775,478 $ 359,814 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 4,256 $ 7,322 Accrued liabilities 64,562 54,977 Current portion of capital lease obligation 1,252 — Deferred revenue 68,037 62,917 Total current liabilities 138,107 125,216 Convertible senior notes, net 352,004 — Capital lease obligation 3,261 — Other long-term liabilities 6,240 6,252 Total liabilities 499,612 131,468 Stockholders' equity: Common stock 8 8 Additional paid-in capital 484,854 434,840 Accumulated other comprehensive income 3,220 2,998 Accumulated deficit (212,216 ) (209,500 ) Total stockholders' equity $ 275,866 $ 228,346 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 775,478 $ 359,814 * Prior-period information has been restated for the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which we adopted on January 1, 2018.\nTABLE 2\nRINGCENTRAL, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited, in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 2017\n*As Adjusted Revenues Software subscriptions $ 136,960 $ 104,130 Other 13,383 8,104 Total revenues 150,343 112,234 Cost of revenues Software subscriptions 24,526 20,263 Other 11,148 7,043 Total cost of revenues 35,674 27,306 Gross profit 114,669 84,928 Operating expenses Research and development 22,651 17,087 Sales and marketing 71,920 54,265 General and administrative 21,449 15,805 Total operating expenses 116,020 87,157 Loss from operations (1,351 ) (2,229 ) Other income (expense), net Interest expense (1,411 ) (79 ) Other income, net 73 122 Other income (expense), net (1,338 ) 43 Loss before income taxes (2,689 ) (2,186 ) Provision for income taxes 27 51 Net loss $ (2,716 ) $ (2,237 ) Net loss per common share Basic and diluted $ (0.03 ) $ (0.03 ) Weighted-average number of shares used in computing net loss per share Basic and diluted 78,341 74,682 * Prior-period information has been restated for the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which we adopted on January 1, 2018.
