In January, Khosrowshahi told CNBC the \"moral compass\" at the company was not pointing in the right direction under Kalanick, whose hard-driving vision turned Uber into one of the world's most valuable private companies but also allegedly allowed a toxic work environment to fester.\nIn a press release Tuesday, Uber said, \"maintaining the public's trust, and earning back the respect of customers we've lost through our past actions and behavior, is about more than new products and policies. It requires self-reflection and a willingness to challenge orthodoxies of the past.\"\nTo that end, Uber also said people who allege sexual assault or sexual harassment against the company will now have the option of settling their claims without a confidentiality provision.\nUber said it plans to publish a \"safety transparency report,\" including data on sexual assaults and other incidents that happen on the platform.\nThe changes governing sexual misconduct come a month after Uber announced that it will perform criminal background checks on its U.S. drivers annually and add a 911 button for summoning help in emergencies. It's an effort to reassure its riders and address concerns that it had not done enough to keep people from using its service to prey on potential victims.\nâ€” Associated Press contributed to this report.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
