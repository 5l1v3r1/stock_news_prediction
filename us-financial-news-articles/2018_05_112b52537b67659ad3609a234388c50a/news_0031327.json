The trade finance transaction involved a shipment of soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia.\nUsing blockchain technology, this letter is stored on an open, distributed ledger where every transaction is visible to anyone with access to the system. This eliminates the need for paper reconciliation and a long chain of digital (and paper) communication between the two parties. HSBC and ING said the exchange was performed in 24 hours, whereas it normally takes five to 10 days for such a transaction to go through traditional methods.\nHSBC used the “Corda” platform, which was developed by blockchain company R3. The startup works with a consortium of more than 80 banks, clearing houses, exchanges, and market infrastructure providers to develop commercial applications of distributed ledger technology.\nAnd HSBC isn’t alone in exploring the uses for the burgeoning technology.\nSantander last month launched a foreign exchange service that uses the distributed ledger tech to make same-day international money transfers. J.P. Morgan recently applied for a patent to facilitate payments between banks using the blockchain.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/12/santander-launches-blockchain-based-foreign-exchange-using-ripple-tech.html"], "published": "2018-05-14T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T19:06:00.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
