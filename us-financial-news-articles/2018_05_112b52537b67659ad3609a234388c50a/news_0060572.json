(\"iAnthus\" or the \"Company\"), (CSE: IAN , OTCQB: ITHUF), which owns, operates, and partners with licensed cannabis operations throughout the United States, is pleased to announce its financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2018 (\"Q1 2018\"). All amounts expressed are in USD.\nHadley Ford, CEO of iAnthus, provided the following statement on the Company's Q1 2018 results:\n\"With the continued development of licensed operations and assets, iAnthus has successfully transitioned to an owner and operator in the U.S. regulated cannabis sector. In the East Coast states of New York, Florida, Massachusetts, and Vermont, iAnthus now holds licenses to operate up to four cultivation and processing facilities and 34 dispensaries. The Company has made significant investments in building out its cultivation operations and dispensaries across each of these states, resulting in increased production capacity and competitive retail locations. As we look ahead to the next quarter, we expect iAnthus to continue to be aggressive in ramping up production and dispensary openings across each of our operations.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThe Company recorded $3.2 million of revenues in Q1 2018, compared to $0.3 million in Q1 2017. Total revenues include the Company's inaugural cannabis revenues totaling $0.2 million, as the Company transitions to an owner and operator of licensed assets in the cannabis sector, in addition to $2.6 million in fair value adjustment on biological assets, which represents results from the Company's cultivation operations;\nThe net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately ($0.6 million), or ($0.01) per share compared to a loss of approximately ($1.9 million), or ($0.07) per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the net loss for Q1 2018 compared to the prior period is primarily due to increases in deal related expenses including legal, professional and transaction fees relating to the acquisitions in Florida and New York, which were offset by a significant non-cash fair value adjustment on the derivatives attached to the debentures that were issued in January 2018;\nAssets increased to $124.0 million at March 31, 2018 from $45.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of 271% that was primarily due to the acquisitions of Citiva and GrowHealthy; and\nThe Company received $5.1 million representing two principal repayments of $2.0 million each plus accrued interest from The Green Solution, LLC, in February and April 2018, respectively. The remaining $3.5 million balance and accrued interest is expected to be received in July 2018.\nDevelopments Subsequent to the Quarter\nOn May 14, 2018, the Company received a $50.0 million investment from Gotham Green Partners (\"GGP\"), of which $40.0 million was in the form of high yield senior secured notes, which bear a 13% coupon and are exchangeable into shares of the Company (\"HY Notes\"). The Company concurrently issued $10.0 million in the form of Class A shares. The proceeds of the financing were allocated to repay principal and interest on the $20.0 million of unsecured debentures issued in January 2018. In addition, the proceeds will be allocated to continued cultivation and dispensary build-outs in the Company's key markets of New York and Florida, with the remainder to be utilized for potential expansion activities consistent with the Company's strategic objectives. Net cash proceeds to the Company were approximately $46.0 million after deducting various fees and structuring costs.\nBusiness Update\nMassachusetts – Mayflower Medicinals Highlights:\nMayflower received its final certificate of registration from the Department of Public Health and began operations at its 36,000 square-foot Holliston cultivation and processing facility; the facility has the capability of producing 2,625 kg of product annually;\nMayflower received and planted its first shipment of clones in the first weeks of 2018, accelerating the production process and culminating in Mayflower's first harvest on April 20, 2018;\nAt the close of Q1 2018, Mayflower was cultivating 2,670 plants, representing 15 different strains. The Company recorded a gain on transformation of biological assets of $0.5 million for Q1 2018, compared to $Nil for the same period in 2017;\nMayflower's flagship dispensary in the popular Allston-Brighton neighborhood of Boston has received the Approval to Sell from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and is expected to open in the summer of 2018;\nA second dispensary lease has been signed in another state-approved location, with a third dispensary location currently awaiting regulatory approval; and\nThe Massachusetts recreational cannabis program is expected to begin in Q3 2018.\nFlorida – GrowHealthy Highlights:\nRevenue in Q1 2018 totaled $15,783 through GrowHealthy's recently launched delivery program, compared to $Nil for the same period in 2017;\nMore than 25,000 square-feet of the cultivation and processing facility in Lake Wales has been built-out, with an additional 175,000 square-feet of space available for continued cultivation expansion, supporting approximately 18,000kg of annual cannabis production;\nAt the close of Q1 2018, the cultivation facility housed over 2,400 plants representing 70 different strains. The gain on transformation of biological assets associated with GrowHealthy for the period totaled $2.4 million, compared to $Nil for Q1 2017;\nThe Company signed leases for dispensary locations in West Palm Beach, Orlando, Tampa Bay, and Deerfield Beach, representing an aggregate retail space of 13,500 square feet; and\nOn May 25, 2018, Judge Gievers of the Florida Circuit Court in Leon County ruled that Florida's current ban on smokable medical marijuana is unconstitutional. While the Florida Department of Health has appealed the ruling, resulting in an automatic stay, the Company believes that this is a step in a positive direction for increased patient access to medical marijuana and accelerated growth in the Florida market.\nNew York – Citiva Highlights:\nAcquired 8.5 acres of land in Warwick, NY, the location of the Company's planned 39,500 square-foot modular cultivation and processing facility, which will support in excess of 2,200 kg of annual production and which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019;\nSigned a lease on the Company's flagship 2,000 square-foot dispensary in Brooklyn, located in the high-traffic area directly across from Barclays Center.

This was due to a facility-wide upgrade during Q1 2018 which resulted in approximately 50% of the cultivation capacity going offline. The upgrades are now complete and include a new commercial kitchen, improved processing facilities, and additional grow space that has doubled capacity to allow an estimated production of 200kg annually;\nThe Company recorded a gain on transformation of biological assets of $150,696 for the period, compared to $Nil for the comparable period in 2017; and\nA lease for a second dispensary location to be located in Williston, VT, has been executed and is pending state approval.\nColorado – Organix Highlights:\nRevenue in Q1 2018 totaled $1.5 million, representing a 17% increase from Q1 2017;\nAchieved record sales of approximately $0.6 million in the month of March 2018; and\nCurrent state regulatory restrictions prevent the Company from consolidating the financial results of Organix. However, pending legislation in Colorado, if passed and signed into law, may permit the Company to consolidate Organix's financial results in the future.\nNew Mexico – Reynold Greenleaf & Associates Highlights:\nRevenue in Q1 2018 totaled $3.2 million, representing a 32% increase from the comparable period in 2017; and\nThe Company has invested $2.3 million to-date and currently owns 24.6% of RGA. As this does not represent a controlling interest in RGA, the financial results of RGA or its affiliates have not been consolidated into iAnthus' financial statements.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nThe Company will hold a conference call for financial analysts and investors at 8:45am ET on Thursday, May 31, 2018 to discuss The Company's first quarter financial results.
