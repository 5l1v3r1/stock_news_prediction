As a lifelong Angeleno, we are confident Maria will champion diversity and bring our communities closer together.\"\nSalinas' varied experience in the private sector with a major corporation, as an entrepreneur, a corporate director and community and civic leader, along with her clear leadership skills and passion for Los Angeles made her the unanimous choice of a Search Committee comprised of members of the Chamber's Executive Committee of the Board of Directors as well as independent non-chamber members.\n\"As the first new president of the Chamber in over 12 years, we didn't want to leave any stone unturned in our search for the best candidate,\" said Jerry Neuman, Co-Chair of the Search Committee and incoming Board Chair for the Chamber. \"Over the past six months, we conducted an expansive national search to obtain a wide variety of qualified candidates and sought input from all key stakeholders on the characteristics and qualifications they'd like to see in the next president,\" Neuman continued. \"As we went through this process, it was clear that we had found our president in Maria as she met all of these qualifications and more.\"\n\"I am excited and honored for the opportunity to build upon the great progress the Chamber has made in Los Angeles and lead it into its next chapter,\" said Salinas. \"Throughout my career, I have used my financial expertise and business acumen to lead and create change and make a lasting impact both in business and in the community. I look forward to working alongside the talented staff and Board of Directors to continue to carry out the Chamber's important mission of championing economic prosperity and quality of life for the Los Angeles region.\"\nIn addition to her professional experience, Salinas is active in many charities and civic organizations and is known for her history of community engagement.
