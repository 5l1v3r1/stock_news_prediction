(CSE:GET.CN) (OTCQB:GLNNF) (FKT:GJT) (“Glance” or the “Company”) today provided shareholders with an update in respect of the insolvencies of companies for which dissident nominees Jonathan Fry and Spiros Margaris served as directors.\nGlance believes it is important for its shareholders to understand what happened to creditors and shareholders in these two insolvencies. These cases are especially important in combination with a third case, a corporate bankruptcy that occurred while yet another of the dissident nominees put forward by Penny Green (the “Dissident Nominees”) acted as a director.\nGlance believes that the three cases, two of which involved technology companies, will assist shareholders in understanding some of the risks of electing the Dissident Nominees as directors of Glance.\nThe Fry KB Insolvency: shareholders wiped out\nWith regard to Mr. Fry, he was a director and shareholder of a UK-based packaging company called KB Print Limited that became insolvent (the “Fry KB Insolvency”) during his tenure. Ms. Green’s dissident circular (the “Dissident Circular”) disclosed the insolvency but provided insufficient detail.\nGlance has since learned that after assets were auctioned off, shareholder value was apparently completely wiped out by the Fry KB Insolvency. Creditors, including employees, were left with more than $0.8 million in unpaid debts. The company was dissolved in July 2011 after more than a year under the administration of a receiver.\nThe Margaris coolQuestion Insolvency\nWith regard to Mr. Margaris, Glance reports that the corporate insolvency during his tenure as a director involved a Swiss-based technology company called coolQuestion Europe AG (the “Margaris coolQuestion Insolvency”). This insolvency was not disclosed to shareholders in the Dissident Circular.\nAccording to the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, Mr. Margaris was a director of coolQuestion Europe AG when it published a debt call to its creditors in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce and entered liquidation proceedings. The company was subsequently deregistered from the Swiss corporate registry.\nThe risk if the Dissident Nominees are elected\nGlance believes there are significant risks to shareholders if the majority of Glance’s five-member board (the “Board”) consists of directors with a history of bankruptcy or insolvency during their tenure as directors of other companies. This is especially a concern if combined with Ms. Green’s stated objective to increase spending and her previous spending behavior while an officer of Glance.\nAs Glance has noted, none of Glance’s nominees have served as directors of companies that went bankrupt or became insolvent, while three of the five Dissident Nominees have: Mr. Fry, Mr. Margaris and Monique Imbeault.\nOn May 18, 2018 Glance provided shareholders with details of a bankruptcy involving Ms. Imbeault as a director. The bankruptcy involved the Canadian technology company XL-ID Solutions Inc., formerly listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange. After shareholder value was wiped out, the sole secured creditor (a company owned by Ms. Imbeault and her husband) became the sole shareholder.\nQuestions for shareholders to ask Ms. Green\nDoes Ms. Green know about the details of the Fry KP Insolvency? If not, why did she not conduct appropriate due diligence into Mr. Fry? Did Ms. Green know about the Margaris coolQuestion Insolvency? If not, why did she not conduct appropriate due diligence with regard to Mr. Margaris?\nVote the BLUE Proxy for Glance’s Nominees\nGlance urges shareholders to read its proxy fight materials filed on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ) and on Glance’s website at https://glance.tech/agm18/ and then vote only the BLUE proxy FOR Glance’s five nominees to the Board.\nIf the Dissident Nominees are elected, it would be a risky proposition for Glance to have a Board consisting of nominees with a history of corporate bankruptcy and insolvency, combined with Ms. Green’s established cursory due diligence, excessive spending, disclosure irregularities and proclivity for expensive stock promotion.\nThe choice is clear. Protect your investment.\nVote only the BLUE form of proxy well in advance of the proxy voting deadline on June 8, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific time).\nShareholders with questions about voting their shares should contact DF King at 1-855-487-9247 (toll free) or by email at inquiries@dfking.com . The meeting will be held at 1200 Waterfront Centre, 200 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 12, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).\nAbout Glance Technologies Inc.\nGlance Technologies owns and operates Glance Pay, a streamlined payment system that revolutionizes how smartphone users choose where to shop, order goods and services, make payments, access digital receipts, redeem digital deals, earn great rewards and interact with merchants.
