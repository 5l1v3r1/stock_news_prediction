On my way home & as most my friends know I don’t have a heart to give me trouble,” Russell joked in a tweet on Saturday.\nThe NBA legend, 84, was rushed to the hospital from his home in an ambulance on Friday, according to TMZ. The website, which initially reported that Russell had “apparent heart issues” said Saturday it was told by a representative for Russell that he was admitted for dehydration.\nRussell played his entire 13-year career with the Boston Celtics, helping the franchise win 11 championships in that time.\nA five-time MVP and 12-time All-Star, Russell was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1975.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T01:17:37.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
