Echo Lumena, designed for the small to mid-volume laboratory segment, is Immucor’s fifth generation immunohematology instrument and brings brilliant performance and clearer test results with the smallest benchtop footprint and the fastest type and screen turnaround time on the global market.\nTogether with its fully automated sibling, NEO® (currently available in the US for larger volume testing settings), Echo Lumena and NEO offer a total standardized workflow solution for any laboratory. When combined with our innovative data management solution, ImmuLINK, laboratories are able to combine serology and molecular immunohematology results into one view, greatly improving a laboratory’s productivity. “Whether conducting five or 500 type and screens per day, every lab shares a critical goal to accurately pinpoint the best possible compatible blood match for anyone that needs it, when and where they need it. When our automation solution is combined with the sensitivity of Capture® technology to identify antibodies sooner than alternative technologies, it truly means laboratorians can be confident in the results they are producing for physicians and their patients,” said Keith Chaitoff, Immucor’s Chief Marketing Officer.\nChristie Otis, Senior Transfusion Franchise Director, said “Immucor has been innovating transfusion medicine for more than 30 years. We are excited to build on the international success of the Echo Lumena launch by bringing our latest innovation to the vast number of US laboratories that will benefit from the accuracy, flexibility and performance available in the newest generation of blood bank automation.”\nEcho Lumena builds on Immucor’s heritage of blood banking automation leadership and proven Capture® technology. The Echo family has been helping small to mid-sized laboratories automate high quality transfusion medicine since 2007 and has a footprint of more than 1,500 placements worldwide. New capabilities for the improved Echo Lumena system include:\n[Accuracy] Complementing highly sensitive Capture technology, the Echo Lumena’s enhanced reader module provides clearer, real-time results and easy on-screen verification. Hardware and software upgrades also power assay algorithm modifications that improve performance; [Flexibility] More process and reagent controls represent best-in-class technology to maximize safety and security with market-leading specificity and sensitivity. Plus load STAT samples at all times; [Performance] Improved software functionalities including an updated Microsoft Operating System and security updates. Built-in Integration for Data Management and Support\nEcho Lumena and all Immucor transfusion solutions integrate with the Company’s comprehensive data management software solution, ImmuLINK ®, to aggregate all serology and molecular test results, generating a single report with a complete donor or patient testing history. Echo Lumena also includes a bi-directional interface with blud_direct SM , Immucor’s 24/7 remote diagnostics and instrument support solution.\nEcho Lumena is part of Immucor’s commitment to immunohematology automation. Immucor’s innovative technologies provide high-quality, high-performance and scalable solutions to meet the operational needs of blood banks, donor centers and labs, regardless of size or volume. Immucor’s total solution extends beyond instrumentation to include serology, molecular and platelet specialty products. Echo Lumena along with the next generation of our high volume NEO instrument, the NEO Iris™, are both CE marked for use in Europe. Clinical trials for NEO Iris are in progress in the United States.\nRequest a Demonstration\nTo schedule a demonstration of Echo Lumena, NEO or any Immucor solution, Immucor clients may contact their Blood Bank Business Manager or call us at 855.IMMUCOR (855.466.8267).
