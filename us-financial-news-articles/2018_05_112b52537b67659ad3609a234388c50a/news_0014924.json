So it’s a blow when she has to leave school while her mother recovers from postpartum depression. “I’m sorry, Amal,” her father says, “but this is how it has to be now. You’re the eldest daughter. Your place is here.” Here, in this case, is their home in a Pakistani village, a place dominated by the powerful landholding Khan family. Aisha Saeed uses fiction in “Amal Unbound” (Nancy Paulsen, 227 pages, $17.99) to illuminate the real obstacles that girls like Amal face in cultures that discount female agency and education. “You have already learned a lot,” Amal’s father tells his daughter. “You can read and write. What more do you need to know?”\nWhat begins as a frustrating situation for Amal turns catastrophic when, in a heated moment, she talks back to the Khan family’s arrogant scion. As retribution, Amal is forced into indentured servitude behind the walls of the Khan estate. “She will be treated like all my servants, no better, no worse,” the young man tells Amal’s helpless, horrified parents. “I’ll even let her visit twice a year like the others.” The man’s cool indifference to Amal’s wishes will likely be a shock to American readers ages 10-13 who, it’s a fair guess, may never have imagined that such a fate could befall any girl in the 21st century. Once installed in the Khan household, though, Amal’s intelligence (and even her temper) prove invaluable, and her story has a happy ending. In an author’s note, Ms. Saeed lauds the courage of girls who “take a stand against inequality and fight for justice” and expresses the hope that her story will shine a light “on brave girls everywhere.” It’s a commendable view, certainly a fashionable one, this bravery of girls, but why stop there? Millions of boys (and men and women, too) are constrained by the imperatives of feudal and caste-based societies. Amal is in a bad spot, no mistake, but so, the careful reader will notice, is almost everyone else in her village.\nThe resourceful heroine of Watt Key’s survival adventure “Deep Water” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 260 pages, $16.99) spends most of the book in grievous danger. Stranded in open water in the Gulf of Mexico after her father’s charter boat drifts away, held afloat only by her scuba equipment, 12-year-old Julie Sims is trying to keep herself and two other people alive. With her in the water is a boy her own age, Shane Jordan, and his father, Mr. Jordan, who’s delirious and bleeding after surfacing too rapidly (in scuba lingo, he’s “bent”). Slapped by waves, burned by sun and salt, and horribly thirsty, the castaways face one ordeal after another. First comes a thunderstorm: “The air exploded like someone slamming a steel door, and lightning blinded my eyes like a thousand camera flashes in my face,” Julie tells us. “The water went from black to a deep translucent blue and I saw suspended jellyfish glowing in the depths.” No sooner does the weather clear than sharks come nosing around, in a scary scene that ends with Mr. Jordan’s off-stage death. As hypothermia begins to take hold, Julie and Shane see the distant red light of an abandoned oil platform in this gripping tale of endurance for young readers ages 9-12.\nStinging insects, rickety rope bridges, homicidal elephants, panga -wielding miscreants, deadly avalanches: Such are the Burmese delights facing Peak Marcello and his companions in Roland Smith’s “Ascent” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 228 pages, $17.99) , the third volume in the author’s wilderness adventure series for teenage readers. Having survived grueling physical conditions and a moral quandary on Everest in “Peak” (2007) and violence in the Pamir mountains of the Hindu Kush in “The Edge” (2015), Peak and his friends Alessia and Ethan have set their sights on summiting Hkakabo Razi, a remote peak reputed to be Southeast Asia’s highest. First they have to get there, though, which means hiking for weeks through a malarial jungle in shifting and sometimes treacherous company. Mr. Smith’s writing is brisk and full of resonant descriptions, as when Peak recounts his first experience stepping into a bamboo house on stilts: “I thought I was going to fall through and land where the pigs were wallowing beneath the house. I was trying to keep my feet on the joists when the man who had invited me inside saw what I was doing and started jumping up and down on the spongy floor to demonstrate that it was safe.” Readers ages 12 and older can enjoy “Ascent” as a stand-alone, but the appearance of vivid characters from the previous books makes reading the stories in chronological order the best bet.\nDefenders of the picture book as an art form like to make the point that illustrated stories are for everyone, not just small children. It is an argument that serves Aaron Becker’s beautiful, wordless story “A Stone for Sascha” (Candlewick, 48 pages, $17.99) especially well. The rich, dusky tableaux that he presents may be a little too cryptic for the very young, given that they compass the long history of the world, but for older children, including adults, they’ll hold rich reward. In the opening pages, we see a girl and her family burying their beloved dog, Sascha. Later, at the seashore, the girl flings stones into the water beneath a starry sky. With a turn of the page, she—and the reader—soar into space and back to prehistory, to the smashing arrival of a meteor that leaves a great golden shard in the earth. In thrilling pictures, eons unfold as we see the stone changing form with the rising and falling of civilizations: It is an obelisk, a building block, a keystone, a carved dragon and, eventually, a glowing stone for Sascha.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T19:08:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
