The platform can also be accessed privately by individuals.\nThe company, whose customers include Adobe and AT&T Inc, said 82 percent of billings in the first quarter of 2018 came from business customers while the rest came from individual users.\nFollowing the IPO, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Aaron Skonnard will hold about 54.4 percent of voting power, PluralSight had said in its filing bit.ly/2KoeiWJ.\nThe company’s revenue for the first three months of 2018 rose 33 percent to $49.6 million from a year earlier, while loss widened to $23.2 million from $9.8 million.\nThe stock is expected to start trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on Thursday under the ticker “PS.”\nMorgan Stanley, J.P.Morgan, Barclays and BofA Merrill Lynch are leading the offering.
