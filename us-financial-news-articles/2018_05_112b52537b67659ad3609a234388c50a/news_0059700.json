When she refused, her father threatened to slit her throat and “chop her up” in 18 seconds - one for every year of her life - the CPS said.\nWith the help of her younger sisters, the woman was able to contact her boyfriend in Britain, who then alerted police.\nShe was rescued within days and the marriage did not go ahead.\n“This victim was cruelly and deliberately misled by her parents, who were determined to take her to Bangladesh for a marriage she did not want,” said Michael Quinn, a senior prosecutor.\nBritain banned forced marriage in 2014. The maximum penalty is seven years.\nThe government’s Forced Marriage Unit received reports of nearly 2,000 possible cases last year, many involving girls from South Asian backgrounds. But campaigners say the figure is just the tip of the iceberg.\nLast week, a mother who tricked her 13-year-old daughter into traveling to Pakistan to marry an older man was jailed for four and a half years, becoming the first person in England to be convicted of forced marriage.\n“It is positive to see a second forced marriage conviction so soon after the first successful conviction of this type in the UK,” said Diana Nammi, director of the Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organization (IKWRO), which supports victims of forced marriage.\nIKWRO said there were more than 3,500 reports of forced marriages made to police between 2014 and 2016.\nKarma Nirvana, another support group, said it hoped there would be more convictions given that many victims of forced marriage were children.\n“What I’m hoping is that it will give confidence to the prosecution and to the police to pursue these cases so we can continue this strong message,” said Natasha Rattu, a lawyer at Karma Nirvana.\nRattu said she hopes the convictions will also encourage victims to speak out.\n“It sends a message out to victims of this abuse that if you go to seek help, help will be available,” she said.\nThe couple will be sentenced on June 18.\nReporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Claire Cozens.
