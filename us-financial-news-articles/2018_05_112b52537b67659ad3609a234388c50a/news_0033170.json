The defender was ruled out last week with a knee injury.\nHe selected Fagner of Corinthians and Danilo of Manchester City to replace the Paris St Germain right back and said both were up to the task.\nBrazil's head coach Tite attends a news conference on his 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil May 14, 2018.
