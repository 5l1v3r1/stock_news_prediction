The value of newly added inventories was revised downward from $33.1 billion to $20.2 billion—a large enough cut to offset the gains made by fixed investments (e.g. equipment, structures, and software), which jumped from 4.6% to 6.5%.\nAlso taking a modest hit: Revised increases in consumer spending (from 1.1% to 1%) as well as exports (4.8% to 4.2%). Imports, up 2.2% for the quarter, went unchanged.\nEconomists predict that growth will accelerate as the year progresses and reach more than 3%—a figure achieved twice in the last four quarters.
