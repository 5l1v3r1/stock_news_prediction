His departure set off a scramble among New York politicians looking to move up in the ranks of their parties.\nNew York City Public Advocate Letitia James has emerged as the favorite to earn the Democratic nomination for the position, according to party insiders. Zephyr Teachout, a law professor and former gubernatorial candidate who lost the 2014 primary to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has said she will also seek the Democratic nomination at the convention.\n“We have a broad spectrum of people who have expressed interest in the race,” said Geoff Berman, executive director of the New York state Democratic Committee. “It’s exciting in a way because it’s democracy in action.”\nOn the Republican side, John Cahill, who previously ran for attorney general in 2014, is considering seeking the Republican nomination for attorney general and would be considered the front-runner, according to party insiders. Manny Alicandro, a Wall Street attorney and former stand-up comedian, has said he will seek the GOP nod at the party’s convention at the Ziegfeld Ballroom in Manhattan. Keith Wofford, a partner at law firm Ropes & Gray who has never run for public office, also is thinking about running.\nEd Cox, chairman of the New York Republican Party, said each of the GOP’s potential candidates would be talented and capable attorneys general.\n“Each in his own way is a professional and who would be the people’s lawyer and not the politicians’ lawyer,” Mr. Cox said.\nAt the Working Families Party convention Saturday, party members declined to make a typical attorney general nomination. Instead, the party chose a placeholder candidate who, officials said, would vacate his place before the November election.\nMembers said they would support either Ms. Teachout or Ms. James, both of whom have longtime party connections.\n“There are two incredible progressive women in the race and New Yorkers would be lucky to have either as Attorney General,” New York Working Families Party Director Bill Lipton said in a statement.\nOne big name that could shake up the attorney general’s race is former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The former federal prosecutor hasn’t ruled out running for the open position.\nSteven Greenberg, a pollster for Siena College, called Mr. Bharara “the ultimate wild card.” But Mr. Greenberg said he would face tough odds should he choose to run, noting that it has been nearly five decades since a candidate won a statewide race on an independent party line.\nFor the gubernatorial nomination, Republicans are expected to tap Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro. Mr. Molinaro isn’t widely known throughout the state. A Siena College poll from April, showed Mr. Cuomo leading him 57% to 31%.\nMr. Cox, the New York Republican Party chairman, cast doubt on the statewide popularity of Mr. Cuomo, a Democratic.\n“He is campaigning to be president not to be governor,” Mr. Cox said. “I think the people of New York state don’t like to be stepping stones for someone’s political ambitions.”\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo’s campaign said New York Republicans’ biggest success in recent years has been electing President Donald Trump.\n“It’s no wonder why the N.Y. GOP hasn’t had a credible statewide candidate in over a decade,” the Cuomo campaign spokeswoman said.\nMr. Cuomo is expected to be formally nominated by the Democratic Party during this week’s convention at Hofstra University on Long Island. But his rival, actress Cynthia Nixon, will also seek the nomination Wednesday, according to a Democratic Party official, testing the depth of her backing within the party. The candidate that secures 50% of support from party delegates will be the official designee.\nA spokeswoman for Ms. Nixon didn’t immediately return a request for comment.\nThe Working Families Party, which previously supported Mr. Cuomo, endorsed Ms. Nixon on Saturday. Ms. Nixon has been waging a campaign painting herself as a more progressive candidate that is more in tune with the party’s base compared with Mr. Cuomo.\nIn the Siena College poll from April, Mr. Cuomo led Ms. Nixon by a margin of 58% to 27%.\nMr. Berman, the executive director of the New York state Democratic Committee, played down concerns that bad blood between the progressive and moderate wings of the party will linger after the primary.\n“I’m confident by the time we get to the general election the Democratic Party will be fully unified and enthusiastic to elect Democrats up and down the ticket,” Mr. Berman said. “The number of issues and values that unite us far exceeds anything that we may sometimes disagree on.”\n—Corinne Ramey contributed to this article.\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T08:20:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
