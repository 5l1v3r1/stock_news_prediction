Q1 revenues also exceeded the Company’s previous revenue record of $2.78M for an entire year and were almost ten times higher than revenues for the same period in 2017. Revenue was achieved through new and repeat customer orders of the Company’s EV ARC™ products from government and enterprise customers.\nThe Company achieved a gross profit during the period, a confirmation of the Company’s assertion that positive gross profits are achievable at increased sales volumes. Excluding overhead, the direct costs for labor and materials for the Company’s flagship EV ARC™ product are significantly lower than the selling price in most cases.\nCurrent contracted backlog exceeds $2.8 million. The Company expects to convert all current backlog to revenue in 2018 and has a strong pipeline of new business that\nexceeds $10 million.\nThe Company is achieving consistently higher levels of backlog and pipeline through a combination of contributing factors including:\nRecord number of units shipped YTD Follow-on orders from existing customers Improvements in the Company’s selling and marketing activities Increased interest from municipal, state and federal customers Increases in the adoption of electric vehicles (up 37% YoY) Increased legislation and government mandates favoring electrified transportation Additional value stacking on the existing products such as the introduction of emergency power panels on the EV ARC™ product and the enabling of DC fast charging for electric buses and electric passenger cars without grid connections\nThe Company has been able to execute on higher volumes of business since successfully closing a working capital credit line as reported in Q4 of 2017.\n“Record revenues and positive gross margins are strong indicators that we are executing on our plan,” said Envision Solar CEO, Desmond Wheatley. “I believe our fundamentals to be very strong. We have excellent and growing backlog and all the macro indicators are that we are in the right place at the right time with the right products which are, as far as we know, unique.”\nOperating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expenses, were under $470,000 during the period, reflecting the Company’s continued policy of maintaining low corporate overhead.\nInterest expenses during the period were $437,546 of which approximately $379,000 were non-cash expenses related to warrants.\nA previous release reported unaudited results of over $3M. However, Envision was unable to record revenue on two EV ARC™ units, during the first quarter, which were delivered to a repeat, institutional customer, which did receive the units and sign delivery receipts for them during the 1st quarter. Though the customer requested delivery of multiple units during the first quarter their purchasing department was not able to release the purchase orders for two of them. GAAP requires a final purchase order for revenue recognition. Revenue for the two delivered units will be recognized in Q2 of 2018 as a result.\nAbout Envision Solar International, Inc.\nEnvision Solar, www.envisionsolar.com, is a sustainable technology innovation company whose unique products include the patented EV ARC™, the patented Solar Tree® and the patent pending EV-Standard™ products, with EnvisionTrak™ patented solar tracking, SunCharge™ solar Electric Vehicle Charging, ARC™ technology energy storage, and EnvisionMedia™ solar advertising displays.\nBased in San Diego the company employs combat veterans, disabled workers, minorities and other fine contributors to produce Made in America products.
