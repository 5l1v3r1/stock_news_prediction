The court was built in less than a year, after the litigation finally ended.\nCourt One will be demolished only after the 2019 French Open, and Giudicelli plans to allow supporters with a general access pass into the Bullring next year to give them an opportunity to bid adieu to the arena.\nFans with general stadium access are usually allowed into all the courts apart from Chatrier, Lenglen and Court One.\n“It will be an occasion for a nice farewell party,” Giudicelli added.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Simon Jennings\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:51:09.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
