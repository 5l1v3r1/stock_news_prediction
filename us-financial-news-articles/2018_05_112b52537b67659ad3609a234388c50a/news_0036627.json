REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo Politicians are trying to make it as easy as possible to test and use new driving technologies in Britain, seeking to build an industry to serve a worldwide market expected to be worth around 900 billion pounds by 2025.\nCars fitted with ultrasonic sensors and automated and connected software are able to undertake a number of tasks including parallel and end-on parking at the touch of a button whilst the driver stands outside the vehicle.\nThe government hopes such new tools will make it easier to park in tight spaces and that computers can improve accuracy as officials look at other ways to allow new automated technology onto Britain’s streets.\n“We will continue to review our driving laws, in order to ensure drivers can enjoy the potential of these new tools safely,” said junior transport minister Jesse Norman.\nMinisters hope to see fully self-driving cars on Britain’s roads by 2021 and a number of automakers including Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan have already carried out tests.\nReporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:46:38.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
