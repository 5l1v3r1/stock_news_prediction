This will help support growth and employment in the United States.\"\nThe statement concluded joint talks on Thursday and Friday between the two countries, which included several U.S. cabinet secretaries and China's State Council Vice Premier Liu He.\nPresident Donald Trump made reducing the trade deficit between the United States and China a key campaign promise.\nThe statement says that China will \"advance relevant amendments to its laws and regulations\" to allow for more American imports, including changes to patent laws.
