The KBW Bank index is down 4.4 percent amid concerns around European countries, including Italy and Spain.\nThe firm is seeing \"obvious headwinds\" in transaction revenue among retail clients as activity slowed in March and remained slower through April and May, Andy Saperstein, co-head of the bank's wealth management division, said Tuesday in a New York conference. Saperstein also cited relatively low pricing on fee-based accounts. Those accounts are pegged to market prices on the last day of the previous quarter, when the market was swooning.\nMorgan Stanley will spend more on interest expense than before as it diversifies its deposit sources, slowing the growth of net interest income, Saperstein said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:11:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
