Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Englishman, who began the day with a four-stroke lead, fired six front-nine birdies en route to a six-under-par 64 at Colonial Country Club that left him one shot off the tournament record score of 21-under 259 set by Zach Johnson in 2010.\nWith the victory, Rose tied Nick Faldo for the most PGA Tour wins by an Englishman post-World War Two, with nine.\n“I am delighted the way I played this week,” said Rose, who played the course for the first time in eight years. “I haven’t played this venue in a while but to win on a golf course like Colonial I couldn’t be more proud.”\nOlympic champion Rose had a chance to equal Johnson’s record score but failed to convert his 23-foot par attempt at the last, where he carded his second bogey of the day.\nU.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka, who started the final round in a share of second place with Argentine Emiliano Grillo (64), finished alone in the runner-up spot after going one better than playing competitor Rose with a seven-under 63.
