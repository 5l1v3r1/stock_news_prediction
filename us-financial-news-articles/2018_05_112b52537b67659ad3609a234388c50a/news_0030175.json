President Donald Trump first announced the news in December when he formally recognized the holy city as Israel’s capital in a move that broke decades of American policy.\nIsrael has long been a close American ally but Washington — until now — refrained from acknowledging Jerusalem as the country’s seat of government since the city remains a central battleground in the political war between Palestine and Israel.\nThe new embassy has “raised the volume of anti-American rhetoric not just in Palestine but throughout the Arab and Muslim world,” said Al-Faisal, who was Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the U.S. from 2005 to 2007.\n“It’s given impetus to the terrorist groups that have always claimed America was against Arabs and it allows Iran to capitalize on this issue by accusing America of supporting Israel,” he continued.\nOn the topic of Tehran however, Al-Faisal appeared to side with Trump’s actions.
