REUTERS/Stringer\nThe U.S. Commerce Department is exploring options besides a supplier ban to punish ZTE ( 000063.SZ ) ( 0763.HK ), Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday. The review came after Trump pledged in a tweet to work with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help ZTE, saying too many jobs in China had been lost.

This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi,” Trump said on Monday.\nZTE declined comment on Monday. Ross did not provide details about options under consideration.\n“ZTE did do some inappropriate things ... the question is are there alternative remedies to the ones we had originally put forward and that’s the area we will be exploring very, very promptly,” Ross told journalists at the National Press Club in Washington.
