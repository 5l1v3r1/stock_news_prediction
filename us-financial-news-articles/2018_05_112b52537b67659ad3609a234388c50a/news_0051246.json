All three of Saladino’s homers this season have come against Arizona.\nPaul Goldschmidt and John Ryan Murphy homered for the Diamondbacks, who have lost seven in a row and 13 of 14. Goldschmidt has eight homers and 21 RBIs in 23 career games at Miller Park.\nSuter (4-3) gave up two runs on four hits and two walks while winning his second straight start in the Brewers’ first home sweep of Arizona since 2008. Suter tied a season high with 5 2/3 innings, set in an 8-3 victory at Minnesota last Friday.\nThe Diamondbacks (25-24) scored four runs and had 10 hits in the three-game series, a franchise low for hits in a three-game set. They had 10 runs and 22 hits while losing five of six to Milwaukee in the season series, a major league record for fewest hits in a six-game season series. They had not been fewer than two games over .500 since opening the season 2-1.\nArizona right-hander Zack Godley (4-4) gave up eight runs (six earned) and seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. He struck out three and walked six. Godley has given up 15 earned runs and 15 walks in his last 21 1/3 innings over four starts.\nChristian Yelich doubled with one out in the first inning and Aguilar singled for a 1-0 lead.\nGoldschmidt hit his sixth homer of the season to lead off the second inning and Murphy hit his fifth with one out to give Arizona a 2-1 lead.\nJett Bandy singled to open the seven-run fourth and Suter was safe at first when first baseman Goldschmidt threw wildly first on a sacrifice bunt attempt. Yelich walked to load the bases with one out and Aguilar singled to drive in two for a 3-2 lead.\nShaw followed with a homer off the facing of the second deck in right field to make it 6-2. Domingo Santana doubled and Jonathan Villar walked before Fernando Salas replaced Godley. Saladino singled in one run, and a second scored on center fielder Chris Owings’ error.\nSaladino homered in the seventh to complete the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:17:55.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
