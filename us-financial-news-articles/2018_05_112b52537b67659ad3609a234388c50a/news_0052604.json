During this period, we capped our fees and limited loan originations to new borrowers as we increased our testing of new products. Our cash balance is more than adequate to fund operations and provide capital for growth initiatives.\"\nWang continued, \"We have completed all the current regulatory requirements for registration. In the meantime, we continue to aggressively cut operating costs and accelerate company-wide efficiency improvements in order to streamline our business. As of mid-May, operating performance has improved meaningfully due to higher loan originations and the reduced operating expenses. To the extent that the external environment remains stable, we can achieve significantly improved financial results in Q2 and profitable operations in the second half.\"\nThe company expects to formally announce Q1 2018 results in mid-June.\nAbout China Rapid Finance\nChina Rapid Finance operates a leading online consumer finance marketplace in China, facilitating millions of loans annually.
