He said the cuts would not have an effect on the CHIP program itself.\nMore recission packages were planned.

Another “large” package addressing that would be proposed later this year, he said.\nReporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by James Dalgleish\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T06:24:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
