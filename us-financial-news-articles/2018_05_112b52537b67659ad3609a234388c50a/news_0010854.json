Still, he said its something the company has to seriously consider if they determine it will create shareholder value over the long term.\nEarlier this month, the company confirmed it was considering a bid for rare disease drug maker Shire Plc ( SHP.L ) after Reuters reported on its interest. However, the company put out a second statement hours later stating it did not intend to make an offer.\nReporting by Michael Erman, Editing by Franklin Paul\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:01:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
