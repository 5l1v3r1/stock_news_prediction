We want a permanent exemption and then we are ready to talk about how we can reciprocally reduce the barriers to trade,” Merkel told reporters on Thursday.\nEU diplomats say the need to find a unified stance goes beyond just tariffs. The United States has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, posing a threat to European companies doing business there, and has blocked appointments to the World Trade Organization, undermining its ability to settle trade disputes.\nEU leaders agreed on four areas on which the bloc would be willing to open talks with the United States, but only on condition that Washington grant EU steel and aluminium makers a permanent exemption from tariffs.\n“We seek solutions. It is possible, there is room. The agreement yesterday on four points gives some kind of space for talks,” Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said.\nThe areas identified for cooperation are market access for industrial products, including cars, and government tenders, energy - notably liquefied natural gas (LNG), possible cooperation on regulations, and reform of the WTO.\n“These talks will be based on the principles of reciprocity and WTO compatibility and with the objective of avoiding a trade war,” an EU official said.\nTrade ministers are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in Brussels next Tuesday.\nThe European Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 28 EU members, has said it would respond to tariffs with its own duties on U.S. products, including motorcycles and whisky.\nTo keep this possibility open, it published a draft law on Thursday to allow it to impose 25 percent tariffs on a range of U.S. imports from June 20 and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports from March 23, 2021.\nIt will notify the World Trade Organization of its potential plans by Friday.
