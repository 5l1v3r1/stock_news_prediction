They are not like the Japanese who are sticky in wanting to fly a costly Japanese full-service airline.\"\nANA has said it will launch medium-length international flights, potentially flying as far afield as India, as it integrates its low-cost carrier units under the Peach brand name.\nJAL, by contrast, holds only a minority stake in Jetstar Japan, a joint venture with Qantas Airways' low-cost brand Jetstar which flies narrow-body aircraft. JAL said it would continue to invest in Jetstar Japan.\nThe new long-distance carrier is a totally different proposition from Jetstar Japan, which \"is purely short-distance,\" JAL's new President Yuji Akasaka told reporters. Jetstar Japan has given its approval for the move, the president said.\nJetstar Japan said in a statement that the new airline would be complementary because it would bring more international visitors to Japan who would then travel on its domestic network.\n\"We are in discussions with JAL about opportunities for Jetstar Japan and the new low-cost carrier to work closely together,\" Jetstar Japan said.\nJAL said it plans to have outside investors in its new low-cost carrier which will be a consolidated subsidiary.\nOther players are also looking to take advantage of Japan's growing status as a tourist destination, with AirAsia Japan having relaunched and airlines such as Hong Kong Express and Singapore's Scoot adding flights to Japan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:01:21.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
