Recent UK consumer data, surveys and company updates have been downbeat, adding to concerns of slow UK growth.\nHowever Next appears to be withstanding difficult high-street trading conditions better than other retailers.\nShares in competitor Superdry tumbled 11 percent on Thursday after the fashion retailer said it expected 2018 full-year gross margins to decline and it gave a weaker than expected revenue forecast for 2019.\nAlready this year Toys R Us UK, electricals group Maplin and drinks wholesaler Conviviality have plunged into administration, while fashion retailer New Look and floor coverings retailer Carpetright are closing stores.\nThe retail sector could be further shaken up by plans for Sainsbury’s to buy Walmart’s Asda for around 7.3 billion pounds ($10 billion).\nWhile best known for groceries, both Sainsbury and Asda compete with Next in clothing as well. But Wolfson said the merger was unlikely to transform the industry.\n“I think they’re two very different brands. Economies of scale in clothing tend to be achieved by buying more of the same garment,” he said.\n“As with all mergers, there will be some economies to be made in things like warehousing... but I don’t think it will profoundly change the clothing market.” ($1 = 0.7378 pounds) (Additional reporting by James Davey, editing by Kate Holton and Elaine Hardcastle)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:01:40.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
