Starting today, Smithfield will issue its 17 th Sustainability Report in segments organized by the pillars of its comprehensive sustainability program each week during the month of May.\nLearn more about our industry-leading approach to keeping our animals safe, comfortable, and healthy in our 2017 Sustainability Report at smithfieldfoods.com/animalcare\nTo support the release of the Animal Care section of this new report, Smithfield has also released a new 360-degree virtual reality video , which transports viewers to one of the company’s wean-to-finish hog farms. The company leveraged this technology earlier this year – the first protein company to do so – to take viewers inside a company sow farm .\nThe 2017 Sustainability Report provides in-depth information about Smithfield’s specific leadership positions in the area of animal care, including:\nFirst company to commit to group housing systems for pregnant sows on company-owned farms. Today, all pregnant sows on company-owned farms globally, including joint ventures in Mexico, are housed in groups. First and only company in the industry to report antibiotics usage (since 2007). First pork producer to develop and implement a comprehensive, systematic animal welfare management program. First protein company to release virtual reality videos of its hog farms.\n“This past year marked a tremendous milestone for Smithfield with the completion of our sow housing conversion,” said Stewart Leeth, vice president of regulatory affairs and chief sustainability officer for Smithfield Foods. “We invested more than $360 million and ten years into our transition to group housing systems for pregnant sows on company-owned farms and fulfilled that commitment right on schedule in 2017. We were proud to make this commitment a decade ago, a first in the industry, and even prouder now to have fulfilled it.”\nIn addition to information about these topics, the report also includes details about Smithfield’s ongoing research to investigate alternatives to antibiotics, including a new vaccine research lab, results of internal and third-party animal care audits, and the company’s efforts to continually enhance its animal care management system.\n“Our approach to animal care is rooted in the fundamental philosophy that the healthier our animals, the healthier our company,” said Kenneth M. Sullivan, president and chief executive officer for Smithfield Foods. “Our bold initiatives create value for our business, our contract growers and supply chain partners, as well as the industry as a whole. Our animal care practices and policies underpin our focus on producing good food the right way.”\nTo view a video about Smithfield’s animal care program, click here .\nTo read the Animal Care section of the report in its entirety, please visit www.smithfieldfoods.com/animalcare .\nAbout Smithfield Foods\nSmithfield Foods is a $15 billion global food company and the world's largest pork processor and hog producer.
