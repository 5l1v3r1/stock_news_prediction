The lender said on Thursday it continued to expect house price growth of just 1 percent in 2018.\n“There are few signs of an imminent change,” Nationwide Chief Economist Robert Gardner said. “Surveyors continue to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries, while the supply of properties on the market remains more of a trickle than a torrent.”\nThe Bank of England has said it expects to raise interest rates only gradually over the next three years and the shortage of homes for sale is also expected to continue to shore up prices.
