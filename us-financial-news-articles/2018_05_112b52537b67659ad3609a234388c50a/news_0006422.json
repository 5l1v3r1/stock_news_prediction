In the first quarter of 2017, the reported income from continuing operations was $(60.3) million, or $(0.57) per share, on net sales of $1.0 billion. Income from continuing operations, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2018 was $44.6 million, or $0.55 per share. This compares to income from continuing operations, as adjusted, of $5.5 million or $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The Glossary at the end of this press release contains further details regarding these non-GAAP measures.\n“Terex significantly improved its first quarter earnings per share compared to last year,” stated John L. Garrison, Terex President and CEO. “This strong financial performance reflects the improvements made to our operations and capital structure, and broad-based improvements in our global markets.”\n“Aerial Work Platforms (AWP) and Materials Processing (MP) are off to a great start,” Mr. Garrison continued. “Our Cranes segment improved compared to the prior year, but performed below our expectations in the quarter.”\n“We continue to invest in our Execute to Win business system, which remains focused on enhancing our capabilities in Commercial Excellence, Lifecycle Solutions and Strategic Sourcing” commented Mr. Garrison. “We are seeing benefits from Commercial Excellence in our performance, and expect to start to realize benefits from Strategic Sourcing in the second half of 2018.”\n“We remain committed to our Disciplined Capital Allocation Strategy. During the quarter we repurchased approximately five million shares of Terex stock for $205 million through our previously announced program,\" said Mr. Garrison.\n“We are increasing our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance from $2.35 to $2.65 to $2.70 to $3.00,” continued Mr. Garrison. “This improvement reflects our first quarter results and capital market actions, and our expectation for continued growth and operational improvements over the balance of 2018.”\nNon-GAAP Measures and Other Items\nResults of operations reflect continuing operations. All per share amounts are on a fully diluted basis. A comprehensive review of the quarterly financial performance is contained in the presentation that will accompany the Company’s earnings conference call.\nIn this press release, Terex refers to various GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. Terex believes that this non-GAAP information is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying businesses.\nThe Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the timing and magnitude of future charges that would be included in the reported GAAP results.\nThe Glossary at the end of this press release contains further details about this subject.\nConference call\nThe Company has scheduled a one hour conference call to review the financial results on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET. John L. Garrison, President and CEO, will host the call. A simultaneous webcast of this call will be available from the Investor Relations section of www.terex.com , under Latest Events & Presentations. Participants are encouraged to access the call 10 minutes prior to the starting time. The call will also be archived in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company's website in the Event Archive.\nThis press release contains forward-looking information regarding future events or the Company’s future financial performance based on the current expectations of Terex Corporation.

These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. In addition, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Terex believes that this non-GAAP information is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying businesses. Management of Terex uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to establish internal budgets and targets and to evaluate the Company’s financial performance against such budgets and targets.\nThe amounts described below are unaudited, are reported in millions of U.S. dollars (except share data and percentages), and are as of or for the period ended March 31, 2018, unless otherwise indicated.\n2018 Outlook: The Company’s 2018 outlook for earnings per share and 2018 full year adjusted forecasted tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude items such as restructuring and other related charges, transformation costs, the impact of the release of tax valuation allowances, gains and losses on divestitures and other unusual items such as the impact of the 2017 US tax law changes. The Company is not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and impact of such items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s full-year 2018 GAAP financial results. Adjusted EPS provides guidance to investors about the Company's EPS expectations excluding restructuring and other charges that the Company does not believe is reflective of its ongoing operations.\nAfter-tax gains or losses and per share amounts are calculated using pre-tax amounts, applying a tax rate based on jurisdictional rates to arrive at an after-tax amount. This number is divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding to provide the impact on earnings per share. The Company highlights the impact of these items because when discussing earnings per share, the Company adjusts for items it believes are not reflective of ongoing operating activities in the periods. Restructuring and related charges are a recurring item as Terex’s restructuring programs usually require more than one year to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur.\nQ1 2018 Income (loss) from\nContinuing Operations\nbefore Taxes\n(Provision for)\nbenefit from\nIncome Taxes (1)\nIncome (loss)\nfrom Continuing\nOperations\nEarnings (loss)\nper share (2)\nAs Reported (GAAP) $ 59.0 (11.4 ) 47.6 $ 0.59 Restructuring & Related (2.2 ) (0.2 ) (2.4 ) (0.03 ) Transformation 7.3 (1.2 ) 6.1 0.07 Extinguishment of Debt 0.7 (0.1 ) 0.6 0.01 Other (6.9 ) 0.6 (6.3 ) (0.08 ) Tax & Interim Period (3) — (1.0 ) (1.0 ) (0.01 ) As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $ 57.9 (13.3 ) 44.6 $ 0.55 (1) Tax effect on adjustments is calculated using the applicable jurisdictional blended tax rate (2) Based on diluted average shares outstanding of 81.7 million (3) Includes adjustments without related pre-tax amounts and the tax amount necessary to align quarterly tax expense (benefit) with the forecasted full year as adjusted effective tax rate Q1 2017 Income (loss) from\nContinuing Operations\nbefore Taxes\n(Provision for)\nbenefit from\nIncome Taxes (1)\nIncome (loss)\nfrom Continuing\nOperations\nEarnings (loss)\nper share (2)\nAs Reported (GAAP) $ (88.6 ) 28.3 (60.3 ) $ (0.57 ) Restructuring & Related 9.0 (1.5 ) 7.5 0.07 Deal Related 32.8 (12.7 ) 20.1 0.19 Transformation 8.4 (3.0 ) 5.4 0.05 Extinguishment of Debt 45.9 (16.4 ) 29.5 0.28 Tax & Interim Period (3) — 3.3 3.3 0.03 As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $ 7.5 (2.0 ) 5.5 $ 0.05 (1) Tax effect on adjustments is calculated using the applicable jurisdictional blended tax rate (2) Based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 105.2 million (3) Includes adjustments without related pre-tax amounts and the tax amount necessary to align quarterly tax expense (benefit) with the forecasted full year as adjusted effective tax rate\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006643/en/\nTerex Corporation\nBrian Henry, 203-222-5954\nSenior Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations\nbrian.henry@terex.com\nSource: Terex Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.terex.com&esheet=51799203&newsitemid=20180501006643&lan=en-US&anchor=www.terex.com&index=1&md5=dfcdee8d553a9da87586577d78f8ed23", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.terex.com&esheet=51799203&newsitemid=20180501006643&lan=en-US&anchor=www.terex.com&index=2&md5=95e3ac89c4fabf42917d5f6d45924574", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006643/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTerexCorporation&esheet=51799203&newsitemid=20180501006643&lan=en-US&anchor=www.facebook.com%2FTerexCorporation&index=3&md5=63e2c7c057323ef5a21a3d758b6744e2"], "published": "2018-05-02T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T01:18:53.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
