The kingdom is currently ranked as a “stand-alone country”.\nAfter reforms such as an easing of licencing requirements for foreign investment in stocks and changes to custody rules, the index compiler has begung gathering feedback from investors, it said in a statement late on Wednesday.\nIt is asking whether Saudi Arabia should be upgraded, whether that should happen all at once or in stages, and whether the change should occur as soon as September this year, in 2019 or later.\nFTSE Russell decided in March to begin upgrading Saudi Arabia in March 2019, which fund managers expect will ultimately attract about $5 billion of “passive”, index-linked money.\nMSCI will decide on the issue in June; an MSCI upgrade could attract around $10 billion in passive funds.\nS&P Dow Jones estimated Saudi Arabia could ultimately have a 2.57 percent weighting in its emerging benchmark index. It did not immediately respond to a question on how much money is benchmarked to that index.
