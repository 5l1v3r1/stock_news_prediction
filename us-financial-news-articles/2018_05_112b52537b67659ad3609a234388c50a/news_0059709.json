(NYSE: CHS) (the \"Company\") today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2018 first quarter ended May 5, 2018.\nFor the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2018 (the \"first quarter\"), the Company reported net income of $29.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net income of $33.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 (\"last year's first quarter\").\n\"While we are pleased with the launch of our new sales-driving initiatives, first quarter customer traffic was challenging,\" said Shelley Broader, CEO and President of the Company. \"We leveraged strong inventory management and targeted promotions, which resulted in an improvement in trends.\"\n\"We are seeing initial success with our recently-launched ShopRunner partnership and we look forward to the ramp up of our brand offerings on Amazon.com and QVC.\" Ms. Broader continued, \"Over the long-term, we expect these new channels will drive stronger customer traffic and sales. We remain confident in our future and our ability to deliver sustainable growth and value creation for shareholders.\"\nBusiness Highlights\nThe Company continues to make progress on its strategic initiative to build new channels of growth and increase brand awareness. During the first quarter of 2018:\nThe Company announced its collaboration with Amazon.com, Inc. to offer a select assortment of Chico's brand merchandise on Amazon.com . Soma, the Company's Intimate Apparel brand, debuted on the multi-platform retailer QVC on May 5 th during the \"AM Style\" broadcast. The brand's popular Vanishing collection sold out in minutes. The Company launched its partnership with ShopRunner, the free two-day shipping and seamless payment e-commerce network, at the end of March. All three of the Company's brands, Chico's, White House Black Market and Soma are available to ShopRunner's several million active members.\nNet Sales\nFor the first quarter, net sales were $561.8 million compared to $583.7 million in last year's first quarter. This decrease of 3.8% primarily reflects a comparable sales decline of 5.9% and the impact of 41 net store closures since last year's first quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact of the calendar shift due to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017. The comparable sales decline was primarily driven by lower transaction count.\nComparable Sales\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nMay 5, 2018 (1)\nApril 29, 2017\nChico's\n(5.5)%\n(10.0)%\nWhite House Black Market\n(6.6)%\n(9.7)%\nSoma\n(5.8)%\n0.2 %\nTotal Company\n(5.9)%\n(8.7)%\n(1) Comparable sales for the first quarter have been adjusted to eliminate the impact of the calendar shift due to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 comparable sales represents sales for the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2018 compared to sales for the thirteen weeks ended May 6, 2017.\nGross Margin\nFor the first quarter, gross margin was $226.9 million, or 40.4% of net sales, compared to $237.4 million, or 40.7% of net sales, in last year's first quarter. This 30 basis point decrease primarily reflects the initial implementation costs and launch of a new expedited shipping program, partially offset by a 70 basis point improvement in maintained margin.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the first quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") were $186.4 million, or 33.2% of net sales, compared to $182.5 million, or 31.3% of net sales, for last year's first quarter. This increase of $3.9 million, or 2.1%, primarily reflects investments in first quarter marketing and technology.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the first quarter, the effective tax rate was 27.9% compared to 38.2% for last year's first quarter. The reduction in our effective tax rate for current year of 10.3% is primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"U.S. tax reform\") which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This reduction is partially offset by a 225 basis point increase related to excess tax benefits on the accounting for employee share-based awards.\nCash and Marketable Securities\nAt the end of the first quarter, cash and marketable securities totaled $254.7 million compared to $169.8 million at the end of the first quarter last year. This $85.0 million increase primarily reflects cash generated from operating activities.\nInventories\nAt the end of the first quarter, inventories totaled $253.8 million compared to $273.9 million at the end of the first quarter last year. This $20.1 million decrease, or 7.3%, primarily reflects our ability to align inventory levels with sales.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter and Full-Year Outlook\nFor second quarter fiscal 2018, the Company is anticipating a mid-to-high single digit decline in net sales and a low-to-mid single digit decline in consolidated comparable sales. The Company expects gross margin rate as a percentage of net sales to be approximately flat compared to second quarter fiscal 2017. The Company also anticipates SG&A expenses to be up slightly compared to second quarter fiscal 2017.\nFor full-year fiscal 2018, the Company is anticipating a mid-single digit decline in net sales and a low-to-mid single digit decline in consolidated comparable sales. The Company expects gross margin rate expansion in the range of 50 to 75 basis points over fiscal 2017. The Company also anticipates SG&A expenses to be approximately flat compared to fiscal 2017. Given the early nature of the new sales-driving initiatives, we do not expect a material impact to the Company's fiscal 2018 financial results.\nThe Company estimates a fiscal 2018 tax rate in the range of 26% to 28%. In addition, the Company anticipates 2018 capital expenditures to be $60 million to $70 million, primarily driven by store reinvestments and technology enhancements.\nABOUT CHICO'S FAS, INC.\nThe Company, through its brands â€“ Chico's, White House Black Market and Soma, is a leading omni-channel specialty retailer of women's private branded, sophisticated, casual-to-dressy clothing, intimates and complementary accessories.\nAs of May 5, 2018, the Company operated 1,451 stores in the US and Canada and sold merchandise through 94 franchise locations in Mexico.

accounting guidance, unvested share-based payment awards that include non-forfeitable rights to dividends, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities. As a result, such awards are required to be included in the calculation of earnings per common share pursuant to the \"two-class\" method. For the Company, participating securities are comprised entirely of unvested restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\") that have met their relevant performance criteria.\nNet income per share is determined using the two-class method when it is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including participating securities. Diluted net income per share reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from non-participating securities such as stock options, PSUs and restricted stock units. For the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017, potential common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS to the extent they were antidilutive.\nThe following unaudited table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share shown on the face of the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nMay 5, 2018\nApril 29, 2017\nNumerator\nNet income\n$\n29,004\n$\n33,619\nNet income and dividends declared allocated to participating securities\n(714)\n(741)\nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n28,290\n$\n32,878\nDenominator\nWeighted average common shares outstanding â€“ basic\n125,277\n126,050\nDilutive effect of non-participating securities\n39\n53\nWeighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding â€“ diluted\n125,316\n126,103\nNet Income Per Share:\nBasic\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.26\nDiluted\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.26\nChico's FAS, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nStore Count and Square Footage\nThirteen Weeks Ended May 5, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nFebruary 3,\n2018\nNew Stores\nClosures\nMay 5,\n2018\nStore Count:\nChico's frontline boutiques\n568\nâ€”\n(4)\n564\nChico's outlets\n120\nâ€”\nâ€”\n120\nChico's Canada\n4\nâ€”\nâ€”\n4\nWHBM frontline boutiques\n404\nâ€”\n(1)\n403\nWHBM outlets\n69\nâ€”\nâ€”\n69\nWHBM Canada\n6\nâ€”\nâ€”\n6\nSoma frontline boutiques\n270\nâ€”\n(4)\n266\nSoma outlets\n19\nâ€”\nâ€”\n19\nTotal Chico's FAS, Inc.\n1,460\nâ€”\n(9)\n1,451\nFebruary 3,\n2018\nNew Stores\nClosures\nOther changes in SSF\nMay 5,\n2018\nNet Selling Square Footage (SSF):\nChico's frontline boutiques\n1,555,671\nâ€”\n(11,458)\n(1,604)\n1,542,609\nChico's outlets\n302,088\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n302,088\nChico's Canada\n9,695\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n9,695\nWHBM frontline boutiques\n939,606\nâ€”\n(2,345)\n670\n937,931\nWHBM outlets\n143,963\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n143,963\nWHBM Canada\n14,891\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n14,891\nSoma frontline boutiques\n511,989\nâ€”\n(7,335)\nâ€”\n504,654\nSoma outlets\n35,541\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n35,541\nTotal Chico's FAS, Inc.\n3,513,444\nâ€”\n(21,138)\n(934)\n3,491,372\nAs of May 5, 2018, the Company also sold merchandise through 94 international franchise locations.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chicos-fas-inc-reports-first-quarter-results-300656017.html\nSOURCE Chico's FAS, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chicos-fas-inc-reports-first-quarter-results-300656017.html"], "published": "2018-05-30T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:55:23.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
