Prior to that, Swenson was Co-Chief Operating Officer of Lender Processing Services, Inc. (NYSE: LPS), a multi-billion-dollar technology and services provider to the mortgage industry. He led the Company’s Origination, Default and Mortgage Information and Data businesses, including its title insurance operations. Swenson also held the position of Executive Vice President of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS: NYSE), and Division President of the Mortgage Information and Outsourcing Businesses.\nFlueid Software Corporation CEO Peter Bowman commented, “The Flueid team couldn’t be happier about Eric Swenson joining us as our chairman. He is a widely respected and proven leader with extensive business expertise, a complete understanding of the mortgage technology industry, and strong business development and operations skills. As Chairman of Flueid, I know Eric will positively impact our profitability targets, the growth of our client base, and the expansion into additional strategic markets because he brings with him a wealth of business advice and influence.”\nSwenson’s professional experience covers a span of more than three decades and a wide array of businesses from entrepreneurial successes with start-up companies to prominent real estate and mortgage industry positions. He joined Fidelity National Financial (NYSE: FNF) in March of 2000 when FNF purchased Chicago Title Insurance Company where Swenson was EVP of the Southern California Region. During his tenure at FNF, Swenson held several executive positions including President and COO of Fidelity National Information Solutions (NASDAQ: FNIS), and Director of Financial Service Solutions, Inc., a 50/50 Joint Venture between FNF and Bank of America.\n“The real estate, lending and insurance industries all have risks that are ever-changing as closing practices and requirements evolve which is why the inevitable adoption of new technologies will greatly impact how business is conducted,” said Swenson. “I am excited to work with the industry innovators at Flueid who envision these new opportunities on the horizon and are building solutions using technologies, like blockchain and artificial intelligence, that will disrupt how the real estate closing process is done today.”\nAbout Flueid Software Corporation\nEmploying modern technologies, Flueid Software Corporation is on a mission to fundamentally change how the traditional real estate transaction closing process works.
