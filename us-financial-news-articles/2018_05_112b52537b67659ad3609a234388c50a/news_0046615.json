We believe it will be a fantastic new place and meeting point in Stockholm, so we don’t see this as the end,” Ylva Lageson, CEO of Nobelhuset AB, which was tasked to construct, own and manage the center told Reuters.\nThe Stockholm City Council had approved the plans after they were revised to reduce the size of the planned building.\nBusinessman Fredrik Lundberg, often referred to as Sweden’s Warren Buffett, had objected to the scale of the building, citing concerns about the sea view from his nearby offices and the value of their century-old properties.\nIn the past, others opposing its construction have included the National Museum, who would have been a neighbor, and King Carl XVI Gustaf, who presents the Nobel prizes and who has also voiced criticism of the plans.\nJan Valeskog, Stockholm city councillor in charge of construction in the capital, said in a statement that the city would appeal against the ruling.\n“The Nobel Center is an important project that has great cultural and economic importance for the entire Stockholm region,” he said.\nThe city council has until June 12 to make its appeal.\nReporting by Esha Vaish; editing by Niklas Pollard and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:57:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
