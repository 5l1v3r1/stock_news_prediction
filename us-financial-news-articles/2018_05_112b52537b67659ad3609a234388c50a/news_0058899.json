Nearly four inches of rain has deluged the course over the past several days, with Tuesday’s practice round closed to fans and all non-essential personnel.\nThe extremely wet conditions forced the USGA to consider implementing a lift, clean and place rule for the first time in the history of the organization.\n“Our intention is to rely on our considerable experience,” said John Bodenhamer, USGA senior managing director. “We played 72 of these U.S. Women’s Opens, in fact, 117 U.S. Open Championships playing the ball as it lies, finishing the competition and so it’s our intention to do that this week as well.”\nTwo-time U.S. Women’s Open champion and No. 1-ranked Inbee Park called it the wettest conditions she has ever seen at the event. Many players got a practice round in on Monday and the practice facilities were opened Tuesday afternoon.\n“It’s the USGA,” Lizette Salas said on Tuesday, anticipating the ruling of playing the ball as it lies. “They think differently than the LPGA.”\nThe concern among players is muddy balls affecting their play on a course that suffered through a very wet winter and spring even before Alberto arrived.\n“Honestly, I would think that they would have to play the ball up,” third-ranked Lexi Thompson said Tuesday, per Golfweek. “I played it yesterday and it was pretty wet in some spots and some of the fairways are a little bare in some spots. So, I think it will be a little unfair if they don’t, but, you never know. I mean if they don’t, everybody has to play it down and it is what it is but it’s their choice.”\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
