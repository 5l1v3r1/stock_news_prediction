In particular, BAWAG wants to grow with housing loans and auto financing.\n“Retail partnerships will increase our customer base and allow us to grow in the lending market,” Abuzaakouk said.\nThe bank posted a first-quarter profit of 86.5 million euros ($101 million) on revenues of 282 million euros, an increase of 15 percent, which fell short of Morgan Stanley expectations.\nBAWAG shares fell 3.2 percent, while the European sector index traded flat.\nOperating expenses in the quarter increased 21 percent to 130 million euros. Net fee and commission income was up 49.6 percent to 74.5 million euros from the previous year’s period.\nBAWAG bought Austrian credit card issuer PayLife and German Suedwestbank and agreed to take over German building society bank Deutscher Ring Bausparkasse last year.\nIt is also part of a consortium which agreed to buy Germany’s HSH Nordbank, once the world’s largest ship financier, earlier this year.\nThe lender still aims to increase its full-year pre-tax profit by more than 5 percent and confirmed its medium-term targets.
