Shares of Micron are up 31 percent this year through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 1 percent return.\nDaryanani said the number of memory makers shrunk to three from 15 in 1995.\n\"We think consolidation has resulted in a more rational pricing environment, with MU, Samsung, and SK Hynix having no desire to change the Goldilocks scenario,\" he said.\nDaryanani noted that in 2007, the PC industry represented about 42 percent of the memory market versus the 16 percent today. Servers and other markets now generate nearly 50 percent of current memory demand, according to the analyst.\n\"We think the DRAM market has inherently become more diversified than it was 10 years ago,\" he said.\nâ€” CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:21:36.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
