About 70 percent of Hyatt's guests in the country are Chinese travelers.\n\"The government has done a great job of identifying business centers where you've got new early stage companies and innovation centers opening up. So if you look at Xian, for example, there is more and more focus on bringing technology companies to Xian,\" said Hoplamazian.\n\"And I think that is going to be a key reason why some of these so-called second-tier cities are going to be cities in which you'll see a lot of development.\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T04:58:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
