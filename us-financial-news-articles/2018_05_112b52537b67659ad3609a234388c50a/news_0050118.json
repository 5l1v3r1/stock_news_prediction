Picture taken April 29, 2018. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin/File Photo The U.S. Treasury Department moved its deadline for U.S. consumers to wind down business with Rusal to Oct. 23 from June 5 previously and said it would consider lifting sanctions if Rusal’s major shareholder, Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, ceded control of the company.\n“Aluminum is being shipped. Parties who have existing contracts are starting to take deliveries,” a metal industry source said.\nSources say aluminum had been trickling out, but the quantities now being talked about were substantial, however they declined to disclose any specific numbers.\nRusal declined to comment.\nSome customers had asked Rusal after the sanctions were imposed on April 6. to stop shipping metal until their legal and compliance teams had confirmed their contracts allowed them to take Rusal’s aluminum until Oct 23, sources said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “Rusal’s customers need to restock to meet their obligations. It’s a slow process, but it has started,” an industry source said, adding that lobbying by U.S. consumers could mean the deadline was extended beyond October.\nSources said uncertainty about aluminum supplies supports prices CMAL3, which at around $2,250 a tonne are up more than 10 percent since April 6.\nA source at one of the railway operators involved with Rusal’s exports said last Friday that the company was preparing to resume significant supplies very soon.\nThe extension detailed in General Licence 14 (GL-14), issued late April, effectively means aluminum produced and sold by Rusal until Oct. 23 is free of U.S. sanctions, so long as the deal to buy was signed before they were imposed.\nExisting deals include those such as Swiss-based mining giant Glencore’s ( GLEN.L ) seven-year deal to buy 14.5 million tonnes of aluminum from Rusal between 2012 to 2018.\nSources say, stock movement in warehouses approved by the London Metal Exchange suggest nervousness about supplies of primary aluminum may be receding, even if only temporarily.\n“Aluminum taken off LME warrant in Malaysia to meet contractual obligations, to cover potential shortfalls in commitments is starting to be re-warranted,” an industry source said. “Anxiety seems to be fading.”\nStocks of aluminum in Port Klang, Malaysia fell below 303,000 tonnes in the middle of May, down more than 20 percent since early April. They are now around 316,000 tonnes.\nTotal stocks of aluminum in LME registered warehouses at above 1.23 million tonnes are down more than 10 percent since the extension was announced.\nRusal’s metal has been suspended from the LME’s list of approved brands that can be delivered against its primary aluminum contract since April 17.\nIt accounted for more than six percent of global aluminum supplies estimated at around 63 million tonnes last year.\nReporting by Pratima Desai and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Additional reporting by Gleb Stolyarov and Polina Devitt; Editing by Veronica Brown and Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T05:30:13.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
