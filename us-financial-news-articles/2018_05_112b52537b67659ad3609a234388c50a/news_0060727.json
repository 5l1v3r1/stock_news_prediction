It also offers excess capacity for big online delivery firms it declines to name.\nIt steers clear of long-distance transport, which traffics in far larger freight volumes but is dominated by big firms operating vast fleets of trucks at far lower margins.\nThe Madrid-based company has raised a Series B round led by global venture firm Cathay Innovation and joined by new London-based investors along with existing investors including European venture firm Atomico.\nJuantegui said the new funding will help consolidate its position in Spain and Britain as well as expand into Europe.\n“We are studying France or Germany as our next markets. We will open in one of those markets by the end of the year, maybe both,” he said.\nSo far, the company has been gaining traction in Madrid and Barcelona and has opened up marketplaces in Valencia the Basque country, Juantegui said.\nIt expanded into London in 2017, which he said was growing faster than Spain, and the company is considering moves to develop marketplaces in Birmingham and Manchester eventually.\nReporting by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T07:06:08.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
