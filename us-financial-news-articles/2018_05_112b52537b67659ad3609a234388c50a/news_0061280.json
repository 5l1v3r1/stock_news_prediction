We need to tailor support around gender and age so that adolescent girls feel safe from violence and can continue with their education.”\nSouth Sudan, which split from its northern neighbor Sudan in 2011, has been gripped by a civil war sparked by rivalry between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar.\nThe world’s youngest nation is now in its fifth year of conflict, and the violence has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.\nProtracted insecurity has also hampered food production and disrupted markets, leading to hyperinflation - and sparking a food crisis.\nAlmost half South Sudan’s population lacks reliable access to enough food, says the Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\nAs a result, 4.5 million - or one in three - South Sudanese have fled their homes, almost 90 percent of them women and children, the U.N. adds.\nAround 2.5 million people have been forced to seek refuge in Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. A further two million people are displaced inside the country.\nAid workers agreed gender-based violence can leave adolescent girls with mental health problems ranging from paranoia and fear, to depression and despair, but said they had not come across cases where girls were suicidal.\n“Clearly the discrimination faced by girls increases and we have seen many girls who are being forced into early marriage as a negative consequence of conflict,” said Silvia Onate, child protection specialist at Save the Children.\n“Even if children have not experienced violence themselves, they will have certainly witnessed members of their families being killed, and some will face trauma and need psychosocial support. There is however a lack of specialized care.”\nReporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Claire Cozens.
