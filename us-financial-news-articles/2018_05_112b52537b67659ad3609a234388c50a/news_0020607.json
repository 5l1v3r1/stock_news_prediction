(NASDAQ:FHB) (the “Company”) announced today the pricing of a secondary offering of 15,300,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $27.75 per share. The shares have been offered by an affiliate of BNP Paribas, the Company’s parent. The selling stockholder has also granted the underwriters a 30‑day option to purchase up to an additional 1,530,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholder. The offering is expected to close on May 10, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nIn connection with the public offering, the Company has also agreed to repurchase from the selling stockholder a number of shares of common stock equal to approximately $81.8 million (the “direct share repurchase”). The per-share price to be paid by the Company is the same price paid by the underwriters in the public offering.\nCompletion of the public offering and the direct share repurchase will reduce BNP Paribas’ beneficial ownership stake in the Company from approximately 61.9% to 49.9% (or 48.8%, if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of the Company’s common stock is exercised in full).\nGoldman Sachs & Co.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”, “continue”, “will”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized” and “outlook”, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature.
