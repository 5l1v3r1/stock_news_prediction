The Swiss franc typically attracts capital in times of uncertainty.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was down 0.11 percent at 110.22 yen, but still close to the highest it has been since early February.\nEmerging market currencies suffered more losses on Wednesday with the dollar’s rise, although the Turkish lira pulled back from record lows after the central bank said it would intervene to stop its slide.\nSterling fell towards its lowest point of the year against the dollar amid fresh worries about Britain’s Brexit negotiations and relatively modest UK wage growth, but pared losses to trade little changed on the day at $1.3495.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:48:42.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
