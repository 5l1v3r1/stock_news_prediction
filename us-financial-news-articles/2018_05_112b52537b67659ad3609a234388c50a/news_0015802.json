It will aim to reduce the deficit to 3 percent by 2019 in line with its pledge to meet the West African Economic and Monetary Union convergence criterion.\nAn IMF mission visited Burkina Faso - a gold and cotton exporter - from May 2 to 4 to begin monitoring implementation of the programme, which is supported by a $158 million credit facility.\n“This performance reflects considerable resilience in the face of external shocks, notably three significant terrorist attacks in Ouagadougou over the last two years,” Dalia Hakura, who headed the mission, said in the statement.\nShe said Burkina Faso was also having to deal with a deteriorating security situation in its northern border regions and poor rainfall in 2017, which had hit food production.\nReporting by Joe Bavier Editing by Kevin Liffey\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:45:00.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
