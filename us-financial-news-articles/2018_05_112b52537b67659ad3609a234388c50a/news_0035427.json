(\"Creative Realities,\" \"CRI,\" or the \"Company\") (OTCQX: CREX), a leading provider of digital marketing solutions, announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRick Mills, Chief Executive Officer, remarked, \"CRI achieved revenue of approximately $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, in line with our first quarter budget despite a customer delay in acceptance of approximately $1.8 million in orders, which are now anticipated to be delivered in the third quarter. Our continued progress in 2018 is attributable to two things: investing in our sales team, which has resulted in a record customer backlog and project pipeline, and solid execution of our strategic plan for profitable growth. Our ability to achieve our budgeted first quarter revenues despite customer delays is evidence of the maturation of our business over the past twelve months. Our product offerings and sales team continue to gain traction in a rapidly changing marketplace, and we expect to further build upon this momentum throughout 2018.\"\n2018 First Quarter Financial Overview\nRevenues were approximately $4.1 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, $2.3 million lower than first quarter 2017. Excluding a single significant non-recurring project from the same customer in each period, revenues were approximately $2.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2017, or growth of approximately 24%. Gross profit was $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin declined to 37% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 44% in the same period in 2017 due to sales mix and higher than normal gross margins on a $4.2 million non-recurring project in 2017. Hardware sales grew approximately $0.7 million, or 120% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating Loss was approximately $1.3 million excluding the effect of a $0.5 million one-time non-cash charge related to exit of a long-term lease.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company is reaffirming its 2018 financial guidance previously provided in connection with our FY2017 earnings release as follows:\nOrganic revenue growth for FY18 of approximately 83%, to $33 million. 2018 positive EBITDA of approximately $3.5 million, excluding one-time, non-cash charges related to restructuring.\nMr. Mills added, \"Our business is experiencing tremendous momentum in the marketplace with respect to both organic and inorganic growth throughout the remainder of 2018. We are participating in an increasing number of opportunities and are converting those opportunities into future revenues.\nRecent developments include:\nWe competed and won an RFP for a French company with 850 retail locations in airports throughout the country; Our partnership with one of the largest convenience chains in the country to provide menu board solutions is growing rapidly as nationwide rollout continues; We were selected to install the pilot stores for the launch of an upscale chain of fuel & convenience stores by the largest oil company in the world; We are working closely with the University of Louisville on providing digital signage solutions for their football complex and stadium expansion; We were selected by a North American based LED manufacturer as their provider of installation, maintenance and support services; and We have entered into the sports and entertainment sales vertical, hiring Scott Werlein to drive the development of that business. Scott was the founding member of the Cisco Sports and Entertainment Solutions Group and was formerly employed as the Global Director of Strategy and Digital at Cisco Systems.\"\nMr. Mills continued, \"We have stated before that our primary goal for 2018 is to achieve scale and operating leverage which will result in ongoing sustainable profitability. We are actively working on various consolidation opportunities and have made significant progress in discussions with a number of parties. Our senior management team is now in place with the recent hiring and promotion of Will Logan to Chief Financial Officer, who has done an outstanding job in building a sustainable financial reporting infrastructure. John Walpuck will continue as Chief Operating Officer and focus on the operational issues and opportunities that our larger platform provides. We are focused on the execution of this strategy throughout the remainder of 2018.\"\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will host a conference call to review the results and provide additional commentary about the Company's recent performance, which is scheduled for Wednesday, May 16, 2018 at 9:00 am Eastern Time.\nPrior to the call, participants should register at bit.ly/criearnings2018Q1 .
