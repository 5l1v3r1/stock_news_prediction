Photo: Wiqan Ang for The Wall Street Journal Seattle’s first Nordic Museum, celebrating the city’s many immigrants from Scandinavia and nearby countries, opened in an old schoolhouse in 1980. The new one, by contrast, includes a soaring Fjord Hall with 20-foot-high glass-walled walkways. Any nerve-wracking reactions crossing them are intentional, as the walkways are intended to suggest the immigrant experience. “When you’re going to leave your native land and go to a new land,” says Nancy Zinn, the museum’s curator for special projects, “there’s a little trepidation.”\nThe first Nordic Museum modestly displayed artifacts harking back to immigrants’ journeys and traditions from 1880 to 1920. The new building, which opens Saturday, has 57,000 square feet of space and aims to capture what it means to be Nordic in general.\nThe museum’s location, the neighborhood of Ballard, has long been home to a large Nordic population. After the area became part of Seattle in 1907, about 1 in 10 of the city’s residents were Nordic, according to collections manager Fred Poyner IV. (Nordic countries include Iceland and Finland.) These immigrants had traveled to the Pacific Northwest because of its opportunities in work like logging and fishing, both of which they were familiar with, says the museum’s chief executive, Eric Nelson.\nView of the 34-foot entry hall of Seattle’s Nordic Museum, which opens Saturday. Photo: Wiqan Ang for The Wall Street Journal The museum cost about $50 million to build. As architects Mithun and Ralph Appelbaum Associates designed it, visitors first walk into a 34-foot-tall entry hall, intended to mimic the feel of a fjord, with a deep, long hallway and high, curved walls. The area serves as an orientation to the different cultures on display in the museum, including the indigenous Sami people, who inhabit the northern reaches of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. This part of the museum also introduces a few concepts that are hard to define in English but important to Nordic culture, such as “sisu,” a Finnish concept of resilience, determination and gutsiness, and “hygge,” a Danish blend of coziness and conviviality.\nA grand staircase leads to a “Sense of Place” gallery containing a re-created birch forest, partly surrounded by a 27-foot-wide film screen displaying various Nordic scenes, from Iceland’s volcanoes to Norway’s rugged coastline. “It shows how the landscape developed the values and characteristics Nordic people have,” says Ms. Zinn. “When you live in a very harsh climate like Iceland and you’re far away from your neighbor, you really have to help each other.”\nPast that nature-focused area on the second floor stand two sets of galleries: one a chronological exhibition of the Nordic region’s history, the other dedicated to Nordic immigration to America. The two sides are connected by glass walkways that gradually widen as history goes on, a metaphor for the growth in intercontinental traffic.\nOn the historical side, the exhibits range over seven millennia. Objects on display include scissors, a horse bit and a single-edged sword from a 9th-century Viking grave and a pair of oval brooches from Norway, circa 800-1050, which would have been used by a wealthy Viking woman to fasten the shoulder straps of her dress. A traditional log sauna built by Finnish immigrants in 1918, with a shingle roof and a chimney, sits in the museum’s East Garden.\nThe museum’s main entrance in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood. Photo: Wiqan Ang for The Wall Street Journal Across the first bridge to the south, the theme-focused Nordic America galleries hold wagons, clothing and trunks used by the first wave of immigrants. Tools for carpentry and fishing were “passed down from father to son,” says Mr. Poyner. “They were handmade and made to last.”\nLater exhibits highlight Nordic ingenuity of very different types. The museum nods to famed Scandinavian design with a 1958 chair by one of its highest-profile practitioners, Denmark’s Arne Jacobsen (1902–1971). His blue, curvy “egg chair” has a molded shell. A year later, on the automotive side, Volvo pioneered the production of a three-point seat belt, which includes the now ubiquitous shoulder strap.\nBridges above the hallway connect two sets of galleries—one arranged historically, one thematically. Photo: Wiqan Ang for The Wall Street Journal In recent years, there’s been a strong high-tech connection between Seattle and Nordic countries—with a new wave of Nordic immigrants arriving, partly as a result of hires and acquisitions. The museum notes that in 2011 Microsoft , based in nearby Redmond, bought Skype, founded by a Swede and a Dane. In 2014 Microsoft took control of the Swedish-developed videogame Minecraft. Merchandise related to famous Finnish-developed games like Clash of Clans and Angry Birds is on view as well.\nMore in Icons\nAn Artist Famed for the Art of Sweets Has Portrayed Far More April 26, 2018 Fashion’s Glorification—and Devastation—of Nature April 20, 2018 In Dallas, the Golden Legacy of Ghana April 12, 2018 Two Museums Conjure the Days When Fans Were in the Air April 6, 2018 Delacroix: Beyond the Famous Spectacles March 30, 2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T10:30:15.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
