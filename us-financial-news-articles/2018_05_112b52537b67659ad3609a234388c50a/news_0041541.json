The bank told the Commission it identified more than 1,300 customers who may have been affected by the misconduct of dozens of its bankers.\nNAB has admitted to the inquiry that some of its advisers had engaged in dishonest and illegal conduct such as misappropriation of client funds. It has paid A$19 million in compensation to customers.\nIt also said that for years it charged advisory fees to hundreds of thousands of clients without providing them with services or allocating them an adviser.\nIn an open letter to customers and shareholders, Thorburn said that 20 bankers in New South Wales and Victoria have had their employment terminated, or are no longer with NAB as a result of its investigation.\nThorburn conceded that bad behavior has no place in a bank.\n\"I also know (Australian Securities and Investment Commission James Shipton) talked about focusing more on and clamping down on bad behavior. And I agree totally with that because when we have bad behavior in a bank it's really destabilizing and debilitating.\"\n\"We need to find it, fix it, and hold people accountable. And we will continue to do that.\"\nHowever, the NAB boss defended the majority of his bankers — there are 12,000 versus the 20 who were involved, pointing out \"there's a lot of people here who are doing absolutely the right thing.\"\n— Reuters contributed reporting to this article.
