(the “ Issuer ”) at the Issuer's upcoming annual shareholder meeting to be held on May 30, 2018.\nThere was no change in the Group’s holdings of securities of the Issuer as a result of the event described above.\nThe Group now owns and/or controls an aggregate of 3,943,389 Common Shares, representing approximately 16.67% of the total outstanding Common Shares.\nThe Group also now owns (i) 13,143 Class A Preferred Shares Series 1 (“Series 1 Shares”) which are convertible into 82,143 Common Shares and (ii) 708,347 Series B Warrants that are exercisable for 708,347 Common Shares. If all 13,143 Series 1 Shares and 708,347 Series B Warrants were to be exercised in full, the Group would then own and control, together with the Common Shares currently held, an aggregate of 4,733,879 Common Shares, representing approximately 19.36% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (assuming: (i) that no other shareholders exercise their Series 1 Shares or Series B Warrants, (ii) there are no other changes to the issued and outstanding Common Shares as at such date, and (iii) the Offeror does not sell any of its Common Shares prior to such date).\nEach Series 1 Share is convertible at the holder's election into 6.25 Common Shares at a conversion price of $4.00 per share until April 1, 2021.
