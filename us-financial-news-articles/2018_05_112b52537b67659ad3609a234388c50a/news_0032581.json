The bill still awaits approval from the Senate and President Andrzej Duda, an ally of PiS.\nFrans Timmermans, deputy chief of the Commission, welcomed recent progress in negotiations with Warsaw but said more needed to be done to assuage concerns over democratic checks and balances in the EU’s largest eastern member state.\nLast year, the Commission launched for the first time in the bloc’s history the so-called Article 7 punishment procedure escalating a dispute with Poland over rule of law standards.\n“Of course we would like the European Commission to take a decision favorable to Poland and to withdraw this procedure, which in our opinion is unjustified,” Czaputowicz said.\n“For sure we will try here in Poland to consider these comments from the Commision and will take adequate steps,” Czaputowicz said.\nThe Commission has announced plans to cut funds paid out to member states that undermine court independence and the rule of law.\nAdditional reporting by Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T17:55:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
