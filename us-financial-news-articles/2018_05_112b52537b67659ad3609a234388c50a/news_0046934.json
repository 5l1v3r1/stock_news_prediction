Maybe you were needed up there, but we’re still unaware as why.”\nThe singer, 27, who was named the world’s best-selling artist of 2017, previously said he wrote the track about a friend who lost a child.\nA spokeswoman for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service welcomed the star’s comments, saying activists were “clearly conflating pregnancy loss and abortion”.\nBPAS said they hoped Sheeran’s decision to speak out would raise awareness.\n“There’s been a real transition in the way people talk about this issue. People have been scared of speaking out about this, so it’s great that he is lending his voice,” the spokeswoman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIrish voters will be asked on Friday if they wish to overhaul abortion laws which have divided a once deeply Catholic nation. A complete ban was only lifted five years ago for cases where the mother’s life is in danger.\nTwo opinion polls published on Sunday showed that up to 56 percent of Irish voters were in favor of change.\nIf the referendum is carried, Ireland’s minority government has proposed legislation that would introduce terminations with no restrictions up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy.\nReporting By Chris Creegan, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
