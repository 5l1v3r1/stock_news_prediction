Neither company disclosed the price agreed.\n“The sale will release capital for further investment in our 4G network and a number of state-of-the-art IT platforms, all of which will further enhance services for our customers,” Telkom Kenya CEO Aldo Mareuse said.\nTelkom Kenya and the local unit of Indian-owned Bharti Airtel have a combined 23 percent of Kenya’s 41 million mobile subscribers but have long struggled to compete with sector leader Safaricom, which has a 71.9 percent market share.
