Some employers are foregoing drug testing because the labor market is so tight.”\nThis comes as the unemployment figures for April dipped further below what economists dub as full employment—about 5%. The concept suggests that at 5%, everyone in an economy that wants a job, has a job.\nThe unemployment rate among high school dropouts who are 25-and-over, for instance, was 5.9% in April. And while that was higher than a month earlier, it was below the 6.4% rate a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data has also shown that disabled workers are returning to the workforce, according to the New York Times .\nThe tapping of workers in typically underemployed groups may also help explain why wage growth proved to be slower than expected in April, with the average hourly wages rising just 0.1% during the month.\nThough that may soon change as employers seek to keep their workers by giving them higher wages.\n“With the unemployment rate at 3.9%, we except wages will gradually reaccelerate over the course of the year,” a team of Morgan Stanley economists led by Ellen Zentner wrote in a Friday note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T01:45:11.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
