Our new team members bring deep industry knowledge and experience with them, which will be invaluable as we move forward. I warmly welcome Don, Kristin and Matt, who will report to me, and Stacey, who will report to our Chief Medical Officer.”\n“We are also active in supporting patient advocacy initiatives and are working very closely with the vEDS community to better understand their needs and to learn how we can best partner with them going forward.” Mr. Schelling continued, “Beyond vEDS, we look to advance and expand our pipeline with the goal of bringing multiple products to patients with serious ultra-orphan diseases over the next several years.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights\nExpanded management team by hiring a Chief Legal Officer and six Vice Presidents – previously announced in February the appointments of Terrie Kellmeyer, Ph.D., as Vice President, Clinical Science; John Klopp as Vice President, Manufacturing; and Jason Kneeland, CPA, as Vice President Finance, Controller Ended first quarter with $12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt, which we believe is sufficient to fund our current operating and capital requirements through the end of 2018\nUpcoming Milestones\nPotential publication of celiprolol vEDS Patient Registry data; the manuscript is currently under peer review Targeting a pre-NDA meeting, which may consist of one or more consultations, with the FDA later in this second quarter of 2018 Anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for EDSIVO™ for the treatment of vEDS at the end of the first half of 2018 Continuing pre-commercial activities for EDSIVO™ Making additional senior-level commercial and medical affairs hires this year, as well as continuing to build out the commercial team and add other core personnel later this year\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter 2018\nCash position.

Research and development expenses were $2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017.

General and administrative expenses were $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $334,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Acer’s late-stage clinical pipeline includes two candidates for severe genetic disorders: EDSIVO™ (celiprolol) for vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), and ACER-001 (a fully taste-masked, immediate release formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate) for urea cycle disorders (UCD) and Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). There are no FDA-approved drugs for vEDS and MSUD and limited options for UCD, which collectively impact approximately 7,000 patients in the U.S. Acer’s product candidates have clinical proof-of-concept and mechanistic differentiation, and Acer intends to seek approval for them in the U.S. by using the regulatory pathway established under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) that allows an applicant to rely at least in part on third-party data for approval, which may expedite the preparation, submission, and approval of a marketing application.\nFor more information, visit www.acertx.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” that involve substantial risks and uncertainties for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
