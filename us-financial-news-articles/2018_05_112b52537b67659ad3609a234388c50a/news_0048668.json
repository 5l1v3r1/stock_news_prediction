It will upgrade its factory in the port city of San Pedro for an additional 10,000 tonnes of installed capacity, taking it up to 130,000 tonnes.\nThe Swiss company is Ivory Coast’s biggest cocoa processor, accounting for around 27 percent of total installed capacity.\nIvory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, wants to process domestically 50 percent of its cocoa bean production by 2020 and is granting tax benefits and exemptions to grinders who increase their capacities.
