Dawn Fitzpatrick has been leading investments at Soros as chief investment officer for roughly one year, cementing her status as one of Wall Street’s most powerful women.\nA spokesman for Soros declined to comment.\nCitadel, which invests roughly $28 billion, cut staff at its Apitgon business, one of its stock picking units, by more than 30 percent from late February to early March.\nThe cuts included portfolio managers, analysts, associates and other ancillary staff.\nDeStefano, who did not respond to requests for comment, resigned from Citadel’s Aptigon unit in April, a Citadel spokesman confirmed. She will join Soros in the fourth quarter of 2018, one of the people familiar with her plans said.\nDeStefano graduated from Princeton University and previously worked at hedge fund Pine River Capital Management.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T18:40:38.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
