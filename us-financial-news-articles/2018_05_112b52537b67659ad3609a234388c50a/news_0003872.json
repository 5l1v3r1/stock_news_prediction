I hope this will break down some of that stigma and shame,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe vote comes as nearby Ireland prepares to hold a referendum on May 25 on liberalizing its own abortion laws - some of the strictest in the world.\nAllinson, a doctor, said a public consultation on the Isle of Man - home to nearly 85,000 people - had shown overwhelming support for reform.\nOne woman said she took part in the consultation on behalf of her grandmother who died from a botched back-street abortion.\n“It was very humbling hearing the testimonies of so many women who have been able to tell their story, often for the first time,” Allinson said.\nThe bill also provides for the creation of buffer zones around the island’s hospital, and potentially doctors’ surgeries, to prevent harassment from protesters.\nAllinson said this was to avoid the problems seen in parts of Britain where anti-abortion campaigners have intimidated women using abortion services.\nThe Isle of Man’s strict abortion law means just a handful of terminations are carried out on the island each year.\nAllinson said around 100 women travel to Britain annually for private abortions, costing up to 1,500 pounds ($2,000) on top of travel expenses, while others buy pills over the internet, without receiving counseling or follow-up treatment.\nThe bill still has to be approved by the parliament’s upper branch, but Allinson expected it would become law within months.\nEditing by Katy Migiro.
