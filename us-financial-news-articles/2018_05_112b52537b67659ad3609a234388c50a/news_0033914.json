Together, Emmanuel and I will help our long-term clients take a comprehensive approach to address the rapid pace of consumer change from both global and local perspectives as we continue to help them achieve growth objectives.\"\nDurand joins Oppenheimer from Evercore where he was Managing Director on the Consumer Investment Banking team.
