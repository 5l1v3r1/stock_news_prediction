Stripping out currency effects and the impact of acquisitions and disposals, sales grew 5.3 percent from a year earlier.\nThe company, which runs food outlets at airports and on motorways, said last year it expected sales to rise on average by 5 to 7 percent a year in the 2016-2019 period net of currency moves and asset sales or acquisitions.\nAirports revenue fell by 4.8 percent to 779.9 million euros, but were up 6.6 percent at constant exchange rates.\nMotorways sales fell 2.9 percent to 438.7 millions euros; other channels rose 16 percent to 110.9 millions boosted by the acquisition of restaurant chain Le CroBag.\nShares erased gains after the results to stand down 0.6 percent at 1234 GMT.\n$1 = 0.8534 euros Reporting by Stefano Rebaudo; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:08:57.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
