(AP) — NASA is planning to send a tiny autonomous helicopter to Mars on its next rover mission to the red planet.\nThe space agency announced Friday that the helicopter will be carried aboard the Mars 2020 rover as a technology demonstration to test its ability to serve as a scout and to reach locations not accessible by ground.\nThe helicopter is being developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.\nThe craft weighs less than 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms), has a fuselage about the size of a softball and twin, counter-rotating blades that will spin at almost 3,000 rpm — a necessity in the thin martian atmosphere. Solar cells will charge its lithium-ion batteries.\nFlights will be programmed because the distance to Mars precludes real-time commands from Earth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T01:11:17.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
