We are also looking for others and we shall arrest them.\n“We arrested them because they were destabilizing peace and we shall take measures against those who masterminded it.”\nLast week, fighting between Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland region and breakaway Somaliland killed dozens of soldiers.\nThe fighting appeared to be a resumption of more than 10 years of periodic conflict between Puntland and Somaliland over the disputed region of Sool.\nA week earlier, clashes between the two sides over the ownership of Tukaraq village, taken by Somaliland last month, killed at least 45 people. Forces from Puntland and Somaliland remain stationed on opposite sides of Tukaraq.\n“We shall continue fighting till we liberate Las Anod town. We urge Somaliland to stop suppressing the residents,” Abdihakim Abdullahi, deputy president of Puntland, told Reuters on Monday.\nOther Somaliland officials could not be reached for comment.\nAdditional reporting by Abdi Sheikh in Mogadishu; writing by George Obulutsa, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T13:27:10.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
