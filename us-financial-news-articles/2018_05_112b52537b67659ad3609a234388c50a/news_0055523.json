Bush.\n“At that time, I apologized to Sarah and took responsibility for my actions. I have worked very hard since then to demonstrate my remorse, and today, Sarah and I have a strong, co-parenting relationship,” he said in the statement provided by the company.\nSeldon confirmed the incident happened but said it should not define Bush.\n“Neither of us are proud of the events that occurred during our divorce,” she said in Athenahealth’s statement. “However it should not define Jonathan as a person, or our relationship overall.”\nShares in Athenahealth were off 1 percent, or $1.63, to $151.56 in afternoon trading.\nAthenahealth is fighting a takeover by hedge fund Elliott Management, which has offered to buy the company for about $6.9 billion including debt. Elliott has had a stake in the company since last year.\nA spokesman for Elliott did not have an immediate comment on the report.
