It said it is aiming to make a development decision by early next year.\nSavannah shares were up 13.4 percent at 0742 GMT.\n“We believe that Mina do Barroso has the potential to be a key piece of Europe’s emerging lithium value chain,” CEO David Archer said.\n“Spodumene concentrate (from hard rock lithium) is the dominant lithium product that is traded internationally, and with no current European producer we believe that Portugal could be the first European supplier.”\nOther projects in Europe include Rio Tinto’s lithium project in Serbia, which is not expected to start production until the next decade.\nRio Tinto and Savannah also have a joint venture in Mozambique.\nMeanwhile, Germany has the Zinnwald project in which Bacanora Minerals has a 50 percent interest.\nIn Britain, the government has leant support to work to develop lithium from brine springs.
