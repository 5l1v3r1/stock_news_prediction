REUTERS/Luis Echeverria\nThe woman, identified by her family as Claudia Gomez, was shot on Wednesday in south Texas by an officer who opened fire after several people “rushed him,” the Border Patrol said in a statement on Friday. The agency, alternately describing them as “illegal aliens” and “a group of suspected illegal aliens,” said Gomez was among them.\nThe Border Patrol said in an earlier statement that the people attacked the agent with blunt objects, and that Gomez was among the assailants.

In the video, a woman calls out in Spanish, “Why did you shoot the girl? You killed her!”\nTrump said last week that he was referring to criminal gangs when he called some illegal immigrants “animals.” [L2N1SO0ZM]\nHe defended his statement on Wednesday, adding that he was working on a plan to reduce aid to countries that he said do nothing to stop MS-13 gang members from crossing into the United States.\nThe notorious criminal group has a presence across El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
