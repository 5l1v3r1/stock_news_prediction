This I can confirm to you,\" the spokesman told the press. \"As I understand, the relevant consultations are ongoing and they are constructive,\" he added, without going into further detail.\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is in Washington with a delegation this week for talks with Trump administration officials aimed at easing trade tensions between Beijing and the White House. The negotiations, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, follow a separate round of meetings in Beijing earlier this month.\nTrump has long criticized China's widening trade surplus with the U.S., and in March set off a trade spat by proposing import tariffs on a number of Chinese goods.

This triggered fears of a global trade war.\nChina's trade deficit with the U.S. in 2017 was $375 billion, during which U.S. imports from China were $506 billion while its exports to China were only $130 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
