No date or initial size for an issuance was specified.\nThe programme allows for issuance in multiple currencies, including China’s renminbi, and uses a hybrid structure that combines sharia-compliant contracts known as wakala and murabaha.\nWakala is an agency-based structure where a portfolio of assets is managed on behalf of sukuk holders. Murabaha is a cost-plus-profit arrangement in which one party buys merchandise for another, selling it back at a pre-determined markup.\nSuch hybrid structures are now common among sukuk issued by Islamic banks to ensure their tradeability.\nKFH has previously tapped the sukuk market through its Turkish subsidiary, Kuveyt Turk.
