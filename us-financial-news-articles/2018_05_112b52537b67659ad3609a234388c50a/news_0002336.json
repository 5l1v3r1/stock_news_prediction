In addition, we continue to treat an increasing number of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients with our prostacyclin product franchise, which consists of Orenitram, Remodulin, and Tyvaso, confirming our belief in the organic growth opportunity for these proven therapies. During the first quarter of 2018, we also continued to advance our expanding product pipeline, which currently includes seven Phase III programs and multiple second-generation Remodulin drug delivery systems, as well as regenerative medicine and organ manufacturing programs. We believe that this pipeline positions United Therapeutics as an innovative market leader with the resources in place to ultimately find a cure for PAH and other end-stage organ diseases.\"\nKey financial highlights include (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDollar\nChange\nPercentage\nChange\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\n$\n389.2\n$\n370.5\n$\n18.7\n5\n%\nNet income\n$\n244.5\n$\n178.6\n$\n65.9\n37\n%\nNon-GAAP earnings (1)\n$\n164.9\n$\n165.7\n$\n(0.8)\n—\n%\nNet income, per basic share\n$\n5.65\n$\n4.01\n$\n1.64\n41\n%\nNet income, per diluted share\n$\n5.57\n$\n3.89\n$\n1.68\n43\n%\nNon-GAAP earnings, per diluted share (1)\n$\n3.76\n$\n3.61\n$\n0.15\n4\n%\n(1)\nSee definition of non-GAAP earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP earnings below.\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nRevenues\nThe following table presents the components of total revenues (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDollar\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nChange\nChange\nNet product sales:\nRemodulin ®\n$\n126.8\n$\n145.8\n$\n(19.0)\n(13)\n%\nTyvaso ®\n94.6\n87.4\n7.2\n8\n%\nAdcirca ®\n97.6\n80.0\n17.6\n22\n%\nOrenitram ®\n52.2\n39.3\n12.9\n33\n%\nUnituxin ®\n18.0\n18.0\n—\n—\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n389.2\n$\n370.5\n$\n18.7\n5\n%\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by $18.7 million as compared to the same period in 2017. Adcirca net product sales increased by $17.6 million primarily due to price increases, which were determined by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). Orenitram net product sales increased by $12.9 million primarily due to an increase in the number of patients being treated with Orenitram and the one-time impact of a change in contractual minimum inventory levels with a U.S. distributor, as discussed below. Tyvaso net product sales increased by $7.2 million primarily due to price increases, partially offset by the one-time impact of a change in contractual minimum inventory levels with a U.S. distributor, as discussed below. These net increases in Adcirca, Orenitram and Tyvaso revenues were partially offset by a $19.0 million decrease in Remodulin net product sales due to: (1) a reduction in quantities ordered, based on variations in the timing and magnitude of orders from our U.S. and international distributors, which do not precisely reflect underlying patient demand; (2) a $7.3 million reduction in sales due to a decrease in the international sales price of Remodulin to an international distributor, which we agreed to in connection with a transfer of additional regulatory and commercial responsibilities to that distributor; and (3) the one-time impact of a change in contractual minimum inventory levels with a U.S. distributor, as discussed below.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our agreements with one of our U.S. specialty pharmacy distributors, in part to make the monthly minimum inventory days-on-hand requirement consistent across Remodulin, Tyvaso, and Orenitram. This change resulted in a one-time decrease in total net product sales of $4.3 million as the distributor adjusted to the new contractual inventory requirement levels in the first quarter of 2018. On an individual product basis, net product sales of Orenitram increased by $3.7 million, net product sales of Tyvaso decreased by $3.5 million, and net product sales of Remodulin decreased by $4.5 million.\nExpenses\nCost of product sales .

The increase in cost of product sales of $43.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily attributable to a $37.3 million increase in the royalty expense for Adcirca. As a result of an amendment to our license agreement with Lilly, effective December 1, 2017, our royalty rate on net product sales of Adcirca increased from five percent to an effective rate of approximately 42.5 percent.\nResearch and development expense .

The increase in research and development expense of $16.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was driven by the expansion of our pipeline programs to treat cardiopulmonary diseases and cancer.\nSelling, general and administrative expense .

The increase in share-based compensation benefit of $82.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily due to a $90.4 million decrease in our STAP liability, driven by a greater decrease in our stock price during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, partially offset by an $8.1 million increase in stock option expense due to additional awards granted and outstanding in 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes was $64.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $85.0 million for the same period in 2017. Our effective tax rate as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, was approximately 21 percent and 32 percent, respectively. Our 2018 effective tax rate decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to a reduced federal corporate tax rate, partially offset by the reduction of the Orphan Drug Credit and the repeal of the Section 199 deduction.\nNon-GAAP Earnings\nNon-GAAP earnings is defined as net income, adjusted for: (1) share-based compensation expense (including expenses relating to stock options, restricted stock units, share tracking awards, and our employee stock purchase plan); and (2) tax impact on non-GAAP earnings adjustments.\nA reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP earnings is presented in the following table (in millions, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income, as reported\n$\n244.5\n$\n178.6\nAdjusted for the following charges:\nShare-based compensation benefit (1)\n(101.1)\n(19.1)\nTax expense (1)\n21.5\n6.2\nNon-GAAP earnings\n$\n164.9\n$\n165.7\nNon-GAAP earnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n3.81\n$\n3.72\nDiluted\n$\n3.76\n$\n3.61\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n43.3\n44.5\nDiluted\n43.9\n45.9", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T17:43:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
