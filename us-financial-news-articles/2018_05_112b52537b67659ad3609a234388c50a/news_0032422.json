In 2016 it also bought a small local debt servicing firm to recover the loans it buys.\nItalian banks have offloaded 75 billion euros’ worth of defaulted loans over the past couple of years, but they still hold 100 billion euros in UTP loans. Unlikely-to-pay loans are harder to sell because they have a much higher net book value than bad debts - so a sale would entail a bigger loss - and also because banks usually have ongoing commercial relationships with borrowers.\nScorsone said banks would find it more efficient to concentrate their recovery efforts on larger loans and outsource the management of smaller UTP loans, which are estimated to account for up to 20 percent of the total.\n“We want to focus on unsecured small tickets, both retail and corporate,” he said.\nMajor hedge funds are betting on Italian mid-tier banks as they shed billions of euros in bad loans.\nTomasz Kurr, director general of KRUK Italia, said the group, which traditionally targeted mostly consumer loans, wanted to tackle more corporate loans.\n“We think the corporate wave is coming ... we’re putting in the network to be there,” he said.\nA fresh focus on corporate loans was also behind last month’s joint-venture deal between Intrum Justitia, a Swedish debt collector specialising originally in consumer debt, and Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo.\nOn Tuesday Banca IFIS, an Italian bank specialising in recovering unsecured consumer loans, said it had agreed to buy rival FBS to expand its business into corporate and secured loans.
