It was a welcomed bounce-back for Arrieta, who lasted only three innings in his previous outing. He has allowed two or fewer earned runs in eight of his nine starts, and he improved to 4-1 in his career against Atlanta.\nPhiladelphia starters have allowed one or no earned runs in 14 of 19 games this month. It is the first time the Phillies’ rotation has done so since 2011.\nSeranthony Dominguez followed Arrieta with 1 1/3 scoreless innings. Hector Neris pitched a scoreless ninth in a non-save situation.\nThe Phillies scored single runs in the third, fourth and fifth innings against Atlanta starter Luiz Gohara.\nPhiladelphia got an RBI single from Carlos Santana in the third. Cesar Hernandez provided a run-scoring single in the fourth, and Maikel Franco knocked in a run with double to center in the fifth.\nGohara (0-1) lasted only four innings in his first start of the season. He allowed two runs on four hits and four walks with six strikeouts. He has not pitched more than 4 1/3 innings in any of his appearances in the minors or majors this year.\nGohara was expected to be in the Braves’ rotation, but the Brazilian sustained a sprained left ankle in spring training and began the season in the minors. He became the eighth different Atlanta pitcher to start a game this season.\nThe Phillies added an insurance run in the eighth when Nick Williams delivered his eighth pinch-hit of the season, his double driving in a run against reliever Shane Carle.\nPhiladelphia handed Atlanta its first setback in a rubber game this season. Atlanta leads the season series 7-5. The teams won’t play again until September.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:12:55.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
