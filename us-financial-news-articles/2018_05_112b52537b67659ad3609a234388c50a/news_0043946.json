The index itself edged up 0.3 percent.\nShares in sandwich maker Greencore surged 9.5 percent following some well-received half-year earnings. However, shares in Halfords slipped 11 percent to their lowest since the beginning of April after the company warned on profit amid a step-up in investment in the business.\n“Not a bad performance amid a pretty tough retail environment but the lack of meaningful guidance for 2019 has rattled the market,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said.\n“Profits ‘broadly in line’ with 2018 is not particularly positive and the market probably also wants to see some more detail from Graham Stapleton after four months in charge,” Wilson added, referring to Halfords’ new CEO.\nResults also weighed on Pets at Home, which fell nearly seven percent as lower margins weighed on full-year profit. The company has been trying to cut prices to fend off German rival Zooplus.\nElsewhere Inmarsat dropped 11.8 percent on the back of concerns that its monopoly in maritime safety communications could come under threat from rival Iridium Communications .
