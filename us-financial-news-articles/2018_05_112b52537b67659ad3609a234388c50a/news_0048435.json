Using this platform, Elligo will streamline patient identification and feasibility through automation using electronic health record (EHR) data within Elligo’s network of providers.\n“We believe this is an important strategic opportunity for Elligo to expand our technology and network growth capabilities,” said John Potthoff , PhD, CEO of Elligo Health Research. “ePatientFinder provides a technology platform and partnership ecosystem that will enable us to automate our EHR data analytics capabilities and expand our network of Research Ready™ sites to further benefit physicians, patients and sponsors.”\nElligo implements its Goes Direct™ approach to provide physicians with the personnel, procedures, technology and infrastructure to conduct trials in Research Ready™ sites. This makes clinical trials more efficient and cost-effective, allowing patients to gain access to treatment options, enabling physicians to avoid the expenditure and effort of managing in-house infrastructure, and making it easier for sponsors to bring new therapies to market faster.\nAbout Elligo\nElligo Health Research offers the only platform that brings clinical research to physician practices, accelerating the development of new pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device products and therapies. Our Goes Direct™ approach uses state-of-the-art elliGO DIRECT™ technology to compliantly leverage current electronic health record data and applies a proprietary, prescreening process to match protocol-eligible patients for participation in clinical studies. It is our mission to support health care providers by providing personnel, procedures, technology and infrastructure for clinical research, enabling patients to participate in research while remaining under the care of their own trusted physician.
