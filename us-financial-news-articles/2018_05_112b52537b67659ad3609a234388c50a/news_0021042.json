The person who is named by the state Legislature as a replacement would have to run in November to keep the post.\nMr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, resigned hours after the New Yorker magazine published an article in which four women accused the 63-year-old of physically assaulting them. Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement that he had “engaged in role-playing” in intimate relationships but had never engaged in nonconsensual sex .\nMore\nNew York Attorney General Schneiderman Resigns After Abuse Allegations Special Prosecutor Named to Investigate Eric Schneiderman New York Solicitor General Will Succeed Eric Schneiderman Battles With Trump, Banks Marked N.Y. Attorney General’s Tenure “This week should be an important reminder of why we need more women in leadership positions,” said Assemblywoman Nily Rozic, a Queens Democrat. “I’m sure a number of qualified candidates will be stepping forward.”\nUnder state law, the New York solicitor general, Barbara Underwood, will serve as the acting attorney general until the Legislature chooses a replacement.\nMs. Underwood, 73, is New York’s first female attorney general. She has been solicitor general since January 2007. She was first appointed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo when he was attorney general, and reappointed by Mr. Schneiderman.\nA Georgetown University Law School graduate, she previously worked as an assistant prosecutor for the Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office and a trial attorney for the Manhattan district attorney’s office, arguing 20 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, according to the attorney general’s office.\n“I am honored to serve the people of New York as acting Attorney General,” Ms. Underwood said in a statement. She said the office’s work “continues without interruption.”\nNew York City Public Advocate Letitia James is among the Democrats being mentioned as potential candidates for the attorney general job.

The governor was among the earliest Democrats to call for Mr. Schneiderman’s resignation Monday night.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo said “a qualified woman would be great, especially in this time.”\nAnother name that has become a frequent mention in political circles in the hours since Mr. Schneiderman said he would exit: Preet Bharara , the former Manhattan U.S. attorney who prosecuted some of Albany’s biggest public-corruption cases in recent years.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who stayed silent on Monday night when other Democratic leaders called for Mr. Schneiderman’s resignation, said the allegations in the New Yorker article were “horrifying,” but declined to name his preferred candidate.\nU.S. Rep. Kathleen Rice is considering running for attorney general, a person close to her said. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Newscom/ZUMA Press Queens Sen. Michael Gianaris is another possible contender. Photo: Sachelle Babbar/ZUMA Press In Albany, legislators were privately discussing the issue and reviewing the logistical rules as they prepare to vote on Mr. Schneiderman’s successor. They are expected to take up the issue in the coming days.\nRepublicans control the state Senate, while Democrats run the Assembly. The Assembly Democratic caucus holds the cards in a joint legislative vote because they have by far the most members of any legislative group. In the past, that Assembly caucus has elevated one of their own when tasked with filling a statewide job due to an abrupt resignation. In 1993, Assembly members voted in fellow legislator Oliver Koppell as attorney general after Robert Abrams resigned to join a law firm.\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, has said little so far, telling reporters in Albany on Tuesday morning that he plans to take up the issue soon and didn’t rule out a candidate from outside his chamber.\nMs. James, a Democrat who won re-election as public advocate last year, is among the candidates under discussion by Democratic lawmakers, according to people involved in the talks. A 59-year-old lawyer, she would be the first African-American attorney general of New York. She declined Tuesday to say if she wanted the job, telling reporters: “The next attorney general will be decided by the state Legislature, and I await their decision.”\nOther Democrats around the state have expressed interest, both as the legislative pick or in running their own campaigns. Among them are U.S. Rep. Kathleen Rice, the former Nassau County district attorney, Queens Sen. Michael Gianaris, and former gubernatorial candidate Zephyr Teachout.\nMs. Teachout wrote on Twitter that she is “seriously considering” running. A person close to Ms. Rice said she is considering running, as did a Gianaris spokesman about Mr. Gianaris.\nZephyr Teachout said on Twitter she is ‘seriously considering’ running for New York Attorney General. Photo: Mike Groll/Associated Press Another person who has been approached by Democratic officials to weigh a possible run is Ben Lawsky, the former superintendent of the state Department of Financial Services and a former federal prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMr. Lawsky also was Mr. Cuomo’s chief of staff during his first term in the governor’s office.\nOn the Republican side, lawyer Manny Alicandro is running for the nomination to be attorney general.\nDemocrats have a more than 2-to-1 voter enrollment advantage statewide, but Republicans were pointing to the Schneiderman scandal to boost their candidate.\nA bipartisan legislative resolution passed before the allegations against Mr. Schneiderman surfaced declared May 8 “Domestic Violence and Prevention Day in the State of New York.”\n—Erica Orden, Melanie Grayce West and Zolan Kanno-Youngs\ncontributed to this article.\nWrite to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T04:35:26.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
