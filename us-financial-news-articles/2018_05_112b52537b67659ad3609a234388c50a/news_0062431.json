They have lost some 14 percent since the election.\nViews in Malaysia’s financial community are mixed on just how much impact the bank will see from the shock ouster of former Prime Minister Najib Razak this month.\nSome bankers expect the change in administration to result in a more transparent process for deals, which would help rival banks that until now have been seen as at a disadvantage to lenders with links to the government.\nOthers expect little impact as group chairman, Nazir Razak, is no longer involved in the day to day running of the bank and as CIMB’s deals team is viewed as quite strong.\nCIMB did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the impact of the election on its business.\nThe bank is expected to record several one-off disposal and revaluation gains for the year.\nIt is selling shares in two asset management joint venture units to U.S.-based partner Principal Financial Group for 470.3 million ringgit and is expected to log a 637 million ringgit revaluation gain on its 40 percent stake in CIMB Principal Asset Management.\nThese gains could help the group kick off restructuring steps such as digitalisation and cutting headcount, analysts have said.\nBigger rival Maybank reported strong first-quarter results on Monday, with net profit up 10 percent on lower expenses and impairment losses. $1 = 3.9900 ringgit Reporting by Liz Lee; Additional reporting by Anshuman Daga in Singapore; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Edwina Gibbs", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T09:25:21.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
