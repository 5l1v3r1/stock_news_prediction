Still, it urged all users to consider changing their passwords.\n“We fixed the bug and have no indication of a breach or misuse by anyone,” Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a Tweet. “As a precaution, consider changing your password on all services where you’ve used this password.”\nThe blog did not say how many passwords were affected. A person familiar with the company’s response said the number was “substantial” and that they were exposed for “several months.”\nThe disclosure comes as lawmakers and regulators around the world scrutinize the way that companies store and secure consumer data, after a string of security incidents at Equifax Inc ( EFX.N ), Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].\nThe European Union is due later this month to start enforcing a strict new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, that includes steep fees for violators.\nTwitter discovered the bug a few weeks ago and has reported it to some regulators, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nFILE PHOTO: A screen displays the stock price of Twitter above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) shortly after the opening bell in New York, NY, U.S., January 31, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which investigates companies accused of deceptive practices related to data security, declined comment on the password glitch.\nThe agency settled with Twitter in 2010 over accusations the site had “serious lapses” in data security that let hackers access private user data on two occasions. The settlement called for audits of Twitter’s data security program every other year for 10 years.\nThe glitch was related to Twitter’s use of “hashing” and caused passwords to be written on an internal computer log before the scrambling process was completed, the blog said.\n“We are very sorry this happened,” the Twitter blog said.\nTwitter’s share price was down 1 percent in extended trade at $30.35, after gaining 0.4 percent during the session.\nThe company advised users to take precautions to ensure that their accounts are safe, including changing passwords and enabling Twitter’s two-factor authentication service to help prevent accounts from being hijacked.\nReporting by Jim Finkle in Toronto; Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; editing by Susan Thomas and Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:47:25.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
