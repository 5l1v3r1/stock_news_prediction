Andar is one of the unstable districts of Ghazni province, 95 miles (153 km) southwest of the capital, Kabul.\nIn a separate incident, two militants were killed when explosives went off on a highway in Ghazni.\nThe Taliban confirmed the clashes. The group’s spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, however, gave a conflicting casualty figure.\nAccording to Mujahid, nine Afghan soldiers and one Taliban fighter were killed. He said 10 Afghan soldiers and three Taliban fighters were wounded in the battle to control Andar district.\nIn April, the militants killed a district governor in Ghazni, his bodyguards and five intelligence agents.\nThe Taliban have stepped up attacks across the country, after they announced their annual spring offensive, a start of the fighting season as the weather allows easier maneuverability through Afghanistan’s mountains.\nThis week suicide bombers in the capital Kabul killed at least 26 people, including nine journalists.\nAccording to the top U.S. watchdog on Afghanistan, the number of Afghan security forces fell by nearly 11 percent in the past year, and the vast majority of Afghan forces are incapable of preventing the Taliban from capturing territory.
