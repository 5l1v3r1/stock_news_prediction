However, it has been suggested that matches could be streamed online or even offered back to Sky, who would then televise games as a secondary broadcaster.\nFounded in 2015, Eleven Sports is predominantly an \"over-the-top\" (OTT) platform, enabling subscribers to view and stream content via a website or app. But the establishment of its own television channel in the U.K. to show Spanish soccer hasn't been ruled out.\n\"We are proud to build on our existing relationship with La Liga, this time in the U.K., one of the most passionate football countries in the world,\" said Eleven Sports' Chief Executive Marc Watson in a statement. \"We will announce soon how we will introduce innovative ways for dedicated fans to watch and engage in the live action. The way people, especially young people, watch live sport is changing and we always try to reflect that in the ways we make our product available.\"\nEleven Sports is owned by Andrea Radrizzani, who also owns English Championship side Leeds United, and already holds the rights to screen La Liga matches in Belgium and Poland. The company also shows Italian soccer and Formula 1 in several other countries in Asia.\nReports have suggested that this could open the door for Eleven Sports to bid for either of the remaining two Premier League domestic packages still to be allocated.\nIn February, Sky Sports and BT picked up 160 of the Premier League matches available per-season from August 2019, with the former taking 128 of them. However, Package F and Package G, comprising 20 matches each, are both still on the market, with Eleven Sports still reportedly amongst the interested parties.", "external_links": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/eleven-sports-premier-league-rights-la-liga-broadcast-deal-sky-sports-andrea-radrizzani-a8332586.html"], "published": "2018-05-02T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T19:02:20.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
