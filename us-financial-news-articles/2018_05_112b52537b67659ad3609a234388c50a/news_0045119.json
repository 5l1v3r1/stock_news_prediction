This would be the longest single opening in years.\nSisi’s Twitter account said the opening of the crossing would “alleviate the burdens of brothers in Gaza.”\nIsraeli troops killed dozens of Palestinians on Monday who protested on the Gaza border as the United States opened its embassy in Jerusalem, moving its diplomatic mission in Israel to the contested holy city from Tel Aviv.\nIslamist group Hamas controls Gaza, but not its most important crossings, Rafah with Egypt and Erez with Israel. It handed control of those crossings late last year to its rival, the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, in a reconciliation deal signed in Cairo.\nEgypt closed the border for long periods after attacks on Egyptian security forces in the Sinai Peninsula that increased in 2013, with Egyptian officials blaming Palestinian militants from Gaza for some of them.\nReporting by John Davison and Nadine Awadallah; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:29:55.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
