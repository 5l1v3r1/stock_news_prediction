Chennai’s been to seven-eight finals, so (have) the experience of big games,” du Plessis said.\n“MS (Dhoni) understands what to ask of the players. We’re playing our best cricket at the moment.”\nDhoni used du Plessis’ knock to underline the team mantra.\n“Faf’s innings is where experience counts,” the former India captain said. “It’s not easy to not play a lot of games, but I always say you need to train your mind as well. That’s where the experience comes in.\n“You visualise what your role is, how you can contribute, and Faf has been brilliant.” (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty; Editing by John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T11:21:16.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
