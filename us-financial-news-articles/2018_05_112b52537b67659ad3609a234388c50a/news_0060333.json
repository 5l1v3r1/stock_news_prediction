EPA/Shutterstock Good morning. More companies are making use of big data to try to keep them out of legal and reputational trouble, but the technology has its limits–and making good use of it is no simple matter, compliance professionals say.\n“There is no question that the focus on data and understanding your data is where the profession is going,” Joel Katz, chief ethics and compliance officer at the business-software company CA Technologies, told the Clearsight Advisors 2018 Compliance Summit in New York on Wednesday . “We’re in the very nascent stages of using technology to make better sense of our data.”\nCompliance teams are hiring more people with expertise in data analytics to help them understand their computer systems, their data and what tools can help best make use of that information, he said. Still, the task remains difficult, Nicole Stryker, a director in the advisory risk consulting and anti-money-laundering groups at KPMG LLP, told the conference.\n“There’s all these demands for metrics and data analytics and how do you get more predictive and manage the risks, but meanwhile we see a lot of companies struggling at the underlying level to get to that data,” she said.\nData can’t take the place of human input, other conference participants said. Janice Innis-Thompson, chief compliance officer at Samsung Electronics America, said each time she enters a new company she spends a month talking with the leaders of its various businesses, assessing the risks the firm faces and how staff see the challenges.\n“I use the data to help inform [business leaders she talks with] of what I think the risks are, but I don’t think you can use data alone to get to the risks,” she said. “You have to talk to the people. You have to be there and show them you saw that data and get their thoughts on it as well.”\nBusinesses generally have a good sense of what their risks are, so spending lots of time crunching data to identify trouble spots may not make sense, said Scott Lane, chairman and chief executive officer of Red Flag Group, a compliance-advisory firm.\n“The data can be used to potentially validate and to identify the seriousness of that risk, and to perhaps predict when that risk is going to happen, but looking at the data to identify that risk I think is a fallacy,” said Mr. Lane.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nU.S. adds entity to list of terrorists. The U.S. State Department added another offshoot of a Syrian group spawned from al Qaeda to its list of terrorists.\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham was named Thursday by the State Department as another alias for the Nusra Front. The State Department has repeatedly amended its sanctions designation on Nusra Front as the group takes on new names to continue its activities. The Wall Street Journal found last month that the group was consolidating power in northwest Syria in the vacuum left by the Islamic State.\n“Whatever name Nusra chooses, we will continue to deny the resources it seeks to further its violent cause,” said Ambassador Nathan Sales, the U.S. State Department’s coordinator for counterterrorism, in a statement.\nThe group’s leader vowed to conquer Damascus and impose Islamic rule across Syria, the Journal reported in April. The group has battled Western-backed rebels and enforced its version of Shariah law, and raised funds by taxing flows of people and goods, the report said. It’s based in Idlib, seeking to control administrative sectors across the area through a body called the Salvation Government, WSJ reported. — Samuel Rubenfeld\nCOMPLIANCE\nThe Trump administration, unable to win concessions from European Union counterparts ahead of a Friday deadline, is planning to make good on its threat to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum, the WSJ reports.
