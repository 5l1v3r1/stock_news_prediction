They declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media.\nSaudi Arabia was likely reducing heavy crude supplies to help meet a rise in its own crude oil demand for power generation during summer, traders said.\nLast week, state oil giant Saudi Aramco raised the June price for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers to the highest since August 2014.\nSaudi Aramco could not be immediately reached for comment.\nReporting by Florence Tan; editing by Joseph Radford and Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T10:10:50.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
