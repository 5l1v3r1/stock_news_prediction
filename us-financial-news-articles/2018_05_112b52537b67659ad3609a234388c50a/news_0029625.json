This may constitute a violation of anti-monopoly law and that is why we put the allegations to Gazprom and five other entities,” he said.\nReporting by Anna Koper; writing by Agnieszka Barteczko; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:33:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
