Italy’s 10-year bond yield jumped 24 bps to 2.93 percent — their highest since around mid-2014.\nThat left the Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap at 264 bps, its widest since 2013.\nSpain’s bond-yield spread with Germany, pushed out also by its political worries in Madrid, was at its widest in seven months at 122 bps.\nThe euro dropped below the $1.16 line for the first time in 6-1/2 months on Tuesday, down 0.3 percent on the day. Against the franc, it fell by a similiar margin at 1.1528 francs per euro.\nPolitical uncertainty in Italy and Spain meanwhile boosted demand for safe-haven German bonds, with both short and long-dated bond yields in Europe’s biggest economy falling to fresh multi-month lows.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield was last down 5 bps at 0.29 percent.
