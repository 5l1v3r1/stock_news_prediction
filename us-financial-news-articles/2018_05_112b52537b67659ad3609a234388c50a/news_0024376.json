The three were accused of lying when they explained their presence. Rialto police say the department's response was polite and brief.\nAn attorney for the three called for an investigation into how police handled the situation and suggested the neighbor who called 911 should be investigated for filing a false report. The woman claimed there was a burglary in progress. Prendergast, Marshall and Olafimihan are black; the neighbor is white and hasn't been identified.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T21:57:33.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
