The inclusion will be completed in a two-stage process, in June and September.\nThe HKMA has been preparing for months to make sure there’s enough liquidity in the offshore yuan market around inclusion days, which some expect can draw $17 billion of foreign inflows.\nBut some brokerages are still concerned they may not have access to adequate yuan liquidity to meet clients’ needs.\nThe PBOC said on Friday that offshore RMB business clearing banks and participating banks would be permitted to conduct interbank market borrowing and bond repos in the mainland market.\nTapping onshore liquidity would help them develop their offshore yuan business, as well as duly implement PBOC’s bilateral currency swap agreements, which serve as a backstop.\nMeanwhile, the required reserve ratio (RRR) of the yuan deposits placed by Hong Kong’s yuan business clearing bank in the settlement account in PBOC’s Shenzhen Sub-branch is cut to zero percent, thus freeing up more liquidity.\nIn addition, foreign investors participating in stock connect schemes are allowed to conduct exchange transaction and forex hedging businesses via brokerages or settlement banks.
