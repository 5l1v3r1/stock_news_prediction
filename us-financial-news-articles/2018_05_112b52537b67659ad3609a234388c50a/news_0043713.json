His sixth homer of the season tied the game at 2-2.\nThe Brewers got even again in the fifth on an RBI double by Manny Pina and a run-scoring wild pitch by Romero.\nNeither starting pitcher got a decision. Romero was pulled after five innings, having allowed four runs (three earned). He gave up three hits and two walks, striking out two.\nPeralta went four innings, surrendering four runs and three hits. He walked six and struck out five.\nDan Jennings and Jeremy Jeffress combined for 2 2/3 shutout innings in relief of Peralta before Hader took over to complete the Brewers’ seventh win in nine games on their 10-game trip that ends Sunday.\nCave and Logan Morrison scored twice apiece for the Twins, who have lost five of their last six.\nThe Brewers out-hit the Twins 6-5.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-20T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:24:29.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
