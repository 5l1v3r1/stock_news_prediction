The range of 3.03-3.04 percent is also seen by analysts as a key technical level.\nThe Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.3 percent last month, as rising gasoline prices weighed on discretionary spending, but consumer spending appeared on track to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter.\nRetail sales offer insight into the growth of U.S. inflation, which drives up Treasury yields as expectations of interest rate hikes rise.
