We’re starting to see and what the market is starting to realize is a combination of perhaps the peak in momentum from earnings and economic perspective, combined with late-cycle rate-rising environment.”\nAt 11:37 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 252.45 points, or 1.04 percent, at 23,910.70, the S&P 500 was down 12.66 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,635.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 6.96 points, or 0.10 percent, at 7,059.31.\nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with a 1.2 percent drop in the industrial sector the biggest.\nThe energy sector fell 1.1 percent following a drop of more than 1.5 percent in crude oil prices as the dollar remained near a four-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve meet.\nPfizer fell 4.7 percent, the most on the Dow, after posting its biggest miss on quarterly revenue in a year, on disappointing sales of some blockbuster drugs.\nThe technology sector was up 0.32 percent. Apple was up about 1 percent ahead of its quarterly report after the bell.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.42-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.96-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and 26 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 64 new lows.
