Same Property NOI for the Group in the quarter increased by 3.7% compared to same quarter in 2017. Same Property NOI in Brazil and Israel increased by 15.6% and by 7.8%, respectively, compared with same quarter in 2017. Same Property sales in the quarter in Brazil increased by 10.4% compared with the same quarter in 2017. In Israel, same property sales increased by 6.6% compared with the same quarter in 2017. In the period of January to April, 2018 (neutralizing the Passover effect) same property sales in Israel Increased by 3.2% compared with the same period in 2017. The occupancy rate as of March 31, 2018, increased by 1.2% to 96.1%, compared to 94.9% as of March 31, 2017. Economic FFO for the quarter totaled NIS 168 million (US$ 48 million), or NIS 0.87 per share (US$ 0.25), compared to NIS 174 million (US$ 50 million), or NIS 0.89 per share (US$ 0.25) in the same quarter in 2017. The decrease in FFO is primarily due to the sale of shares of Regency Centers and First Capital Realty and a decrease in Citycon's FFO deriving from disposals of non-core assets. The decrease was partially offset by the improvement in the underlying cash flow of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries, mainly Gazit Brasil and Gazit Israel. Company FFO per share guidance for 2018 is NIS 3.68 per share, an increase of 2.8% compared with the FFO per share in 2017. Consolidated cash flow from operating activities in the quarter totaled NIS 245 million (US$ 70 million), compared to NIS 192 million (US$ 55 million) in the same quarter in 2017.

NIS 221 million and totaled NIS 9,715 million (US$ 2,767 million), or NIS 50.2 per share (US$ 14.3), compared to NIS 9,936 million (US$ 2,831 million), or NIS 51.4 per share (US$ 14.6), as of December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the devaluation of Regency shares which was partially offset by the gain from financial derivatives. In addition, shareholder's equity decreased due to dividend payment of approx. NIS 74 million (US$ 21 million) or NIS 0.38 per share (US$ 0.11) which was offset with the company's FFO of NIS 168 million (US$ 48 million). Adjusted net income* in the quarter totaled NIS 240 (US$ 69 million). Loss attributable to shareholders in the quarter totaled NIS 486 million (US$ 138 million), or NIS 2.51 per diluted share (US$ 0.72), compared to a loss of NIS 276 million (US$ 79 million), or NIS 1.44 per diluted share (US$ 0.41 per share) in the same quarter in 2017.

The net fair value gain of investment property and investment property under development in the quarter was NIS 48 million (US$ 14 million), compared to a fair value gain of NIS 50 million (US$ 14 million) in the same quarter in 2017. The gain is primarily due to revaluations in Central Eastern Europe and Germany which were partially offset by revaluation losses in Northern Europe.\nFinancial Strength\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Group had cash, cash equivalent and unused revolving credit facilities in the aggregate amount of NIS 9.5 billion (US$ 2.7 billion), of which NIS 5.8 billion (US$ 1.65 billion) was at the Company level and its wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, First Capital had cash, cash equivalent and unused revolving credit facilities in the aggregate amount of NIS 1.3 billion (US$ 370 million).

This growth was driven primarily from the results of our high quality private real estate portfolio which delivered same property NOI growth of 15.6% in Brazil and 7.8% in Israel. We see that as evidence of the portfolio's quality and a result of our great efforts to create additional value in our private portfolio.\n\"In accordance with our strategy, we sold in 2018 10.3 million shares of Regency for a total consideration of approximately $598 million (NIS 2.1 billion), and as of this date, hold approx. 8.2 million shares of Regency, representing approx. 8% of our portfolio. The proceeds will be used for other general corporate needs, to reduce leverage, and lower our financial costs associated with upcoming repayments in the next 2 years which bear high interest rates together with recently added attractive credit lines. The disposals of Regency and First Capital shares have led to a decrease in our FFO which was almost completely offset with the strong operational results in Brazil and Israel, which are not yet fully reflected in our results and are expected to have an effect in the year remaining. We provided positive guidance and believe 2018 will end with a 2.8% growth in FFO compared with 2017.\"\nAcquisition, Development, Redevelopment and Capital Recycling Activities:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (excluding First Capital) had one property under development in, Espoo, the greater Helsinki area in Finland, Lippulaiva, with a gross leasable area (GLA) of 44 thousand square meters and a total investment of NIS 931 million (US$ 265 million) which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2021 and which as of 31 March 31, 2018 NIS 247 million (US$ 70 million) has been invested.

References to the “Company” relate to Gazit-Globe’s stand-alone financial statements. Unless otherwise stated, financial information included in this press release relates to the “Group”.\nThe Company believes that publication of FFO, which is computed according to EPRA guidance, more correctly reflects the operating results of the Company, since the Company’s financial statements are prepared in line with IFRS. In addition, publication of FFO provides a better basis for the comparison of the Company’s operating results in a particular period with those of previous periods and also provides a uniform financial measure for comparing the Company’s operating results with those published by other European real estate companies.\nIn addition, pursuant to the investment property guideline issued by the Israel Securities Authority in January 2011, FFO is to be presented in the “Description of the Company’s Business” section of the annual report of investment property companies on the basis of the EPRA criteria. As clarified in the EPRA and NAREIT position papers, the EPRA Earnings and the FFO measures do not represent cash flows from operating activities according to generally accepted accounting principles, nor do they reflect the cash held by a company or its ability to distribute that cash, and they are not a substitute for the reported net income. Furthermore, it is clarified that these measures are not audited by the Company’s independent auditors.\nCONFERENCE CALL/WEB CAST INFORMATION\nGazit-Globe will host a conference call and webcast in English on Tuesday, May 29th, 2018 at 5:00 pm Israel Time / 10:00 am US Eastern Time, to review the first quarter ended March 31, 201 financial results.
