(Nasdaq:TNXP) (Tonix), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its Investigational New Drug (IND) application to support the initiation of a Phase 2, potential pivotal efficacy study of TNX-102 SL* 5.6 mg in patients with agitation in Alzheimer’s disease. TNX-102 SL, or Tonmya ®# is a FDA-designated Breakthrough Therapy in Phase 3 development for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n“This potential new indication for TNX-102 SL expands our clinical development pipeline, leveraging our understanding of the TNX-102 SL mechanism of action on sleep quality and our understanding of its potential clinical benefit in patients with agitation in Alzheimer’s disease,” commented Seth Lederman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “The investigation of TNX-102 SL for agitation in Alzheimer’s disease may bring a new treatment targeting sleep disturbances in patients experiencing this condition. Currently there are no FDA-approved treatments for agitation in Alzheimer’s disease, despite a high disease burden and a need for an effective therapy. A Fast Track designation request will be filed next month to potentially accelerate the development and review of this unmet medical need.”\n* TNX-102 SL is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication.\n# Tonmya is the FDA conditionally accepted proprietary name for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD\nAbout Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease\nAgitation in Alzheimer’s disease, which includes emotional lability, restlessness, irritability, and aggression, is one of the most distressing and debilitating of the behavioral complications of Alzheimer’s disease. Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease has significant negative consequences for patients as well as their caregivers and is one of the most common reasons for patients having to transition to nursing homes and other long-term care settings. Agitation is likely to affect more than half of the 5.3 million Americans who currently suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, and this number is expected to nearly triple by 2050. The presence of agitation nearly doubles the cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and agitation is estimated to account for more than 12 percent of the $256 billion in healthcare and societal costs associated with Alzheimer’s disease for the year 2017 in the United States. Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease such as agitation and aggression. There is widespread off-label use of atypical anti-psychotic medications for these behavioral symptoms, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and significant medical risks associated with their use in this population.\nAbout Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.\nTonix is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing pharmaceutical products to treat serious neuropsychiatric conditions and biological products to improve biodefense through potential medical counter-measures.
