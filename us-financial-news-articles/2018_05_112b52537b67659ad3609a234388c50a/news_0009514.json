(NYSE: SLCA) announced today that it has completed the $750 million acquisition of EP Minerals , a global producer of engineered materials derived from industrial minerals including diatomaceous earth (DE), clay (calcium bentonite) and perlite. The company's unique industrial minerals are used as filter aids, absorbents and functional additives for a variety of industries including food and beverage, biofuels, recreational water, oil and gas, farm and home, landscape, sports turf, paint, plastics, and insecticides.\n''This transformative acquisition achieves a key corporate objective to diversify our profit sources and add additional EBITDA from a broader industrial space to better balance our portfolio opposite our more cyclical Oil and Gas business,\" said Bryan Shinn, president and chief executive officer. \"EP Minerals has a very attractive market structure, is a business with strong margins and very consistent cash flows with numerous growth opportunities and a robust pipeline of new products. Bottom line, this is a very diverse company with a rare combination of advantages and strengths and we are excited about the opportunity to work with the EP Minerals team to continue to grow its market-leading business,'' Shinn concluded.\nThe transaction is being financed by $1.28 billion in term loan facilities committed to by BNP Paribas and Barclays. The company also increased its revolving credit facility to an aggregate of $100 million.\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are \"forward-looking statements\" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and speak only as of this date.
