The Borussia Dortmund playmaker, who has been sidelined with a series of ankle injuries this year, immediately brought more dynamism and creativity to the Japanese attack.\nHowever, it was ultimately a poor night for Nishino, who must now decide on his squad on Thursday with few positives to reflect on from his sole game in charge.\nJapan’s first Group H match is against Colombia on June 19 before they face Senegal and Poland at the finals.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T16:24:12.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
