(Nasdaq:CNSL) (the “Company”) reported results for the first quarter 2018 and will hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss its results today at 10 a.m. ET.\nFirst quarter 2018 Consolidated Communications financial summary:\nRevenue totaled $356 million Net cash from operating activities was $90.8 million Adjusted EBITDA was $135.1 million Dividend payout ratio was 61.9 percent\n“We had a strong start to 2018 and I’m pleased with the quarter which supports the declaration of our 52 nd consecutive quarterly dividend,” said Bob Udell, president and chief executive officer of Consolidated Communications. “We increased our fiber connections for wireless carriers under contract by 13 percent year over year, a notable increase with sales in first quarter exceeding full year 2017 results. We are pleased to realize another quarter of 1.4 percent growth in commercial and carrier data and transport revenue. While the majority of this growth is from our legacy properties, we see additional upside opportunity as we implement our proven playbook in the former FairPoint markets.”\n“We are executing well on our integration and fast start initiatives associated with the acquisition,” added Udell. “Our plan and strategy of investing and expanding our fiber network is working as we upgrade broadband speeds and enhance our product offerings, bringing more competitive solutions to our customers.”\nPro Forma Financial Results for the First Quarter\nThe pro forma results give effect to the FairPoint acquisition as if it had occurred as of Jan. 1, 2016.\nRevenues were $356 million, compared to $371.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Results continue to reflect expected declines in voice and network access revenues, while commercial and carrier data and transport service revenue increased 1.4 percent or $1.2 million. Consumer broadband increased $300,000, while video, a low margin product, declined $1.9 million. In the quarter, the FCC approved our petition regarding Local Switching Support (LSS), resulting in an increase in revenue of $4.9 million, of which $4 million was attributed to periods prior to 2018. The on going increase in LSS revenue is projected to be approximately $1 million per quarter. Income from operations was $8.9 million, compared to $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decline of $2.3 million is due to lower revenue, offset by reductions in operating expenses from synergy realization and efficiency improvements. In the quarter we incurred approximately $3 million in storm recovery and weather related expenses from multiple winter storms in our northern New England markets. In addition, reported expenses in the quarter were lower by $3 million due to a change in accounting for sales acquisition costs as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606. Interest expense, net was $32.7 million, compared to $28.5 million for the same period last year. The change is in part due to increases in LIBOR and non-cash costs of $2.3 million associated with additional interest rate swaps to increase our percentage of fixed debt to approximately 75 percent. Other income, net was $8.4 million, compared to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to increased income from the Company’s minority interest in wireless partnerships. Cash distributions from the Company’s wireless partnerships were $9.5 million for the first quarter compared to $5.6 million for the prior year period. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $11.2 million and GAAP loss per share was ($0.16). Adjusted diluted net income per share excludes certain items in the manner described in the table provided in this release. Adjusted diluted net income per share was ($0.07) in the first quarter, compared to $0.11 the same period last year. Additionally, net income per share has been impacted by approximately ($0.11) due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the valuation of the FairPoint assets. Adjusted EBITDA was $135.1 million compared to pro forma $128.5 million a year ago. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to increases in wireless cash distributions and changes in revenues and expenses as previously described. The total net debt to pro forma last 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.31x, before giving effect to full targeted synergies of $55 million which are expected to be realized within the first two years from closing the FairPoint acquisition.\nCash Available to Pay Dividends, Capex\nFor the first quarter, cash available to pay dividends was $44.3 million, and the dividend payout ratio was 61.9 percent compared to 80.5 percent in the first quarter a year ago. At March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $11.1 million. Capital expenditures were $60.8 million for the first quarter.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe Company affirmed its 2018 guidance as follows:\n($ in millions) 2017 Pro Forma\nResults 2018 Guidance Cash interest expense 1 $112.9 $123 to $128 Cash income taxes/refund 2 $1.3 $1 to $3 Capital expenditures $227.2 $235 to $245 (1) 2017 Pro Forma cash interest expense is based on actual interest expense incurred since the July 3, 2017 closing of the Fairpoint acquisition and pro forma for Jan. 1, 2017 through July 3, 2017 calculated as if the merger was in effect at Jan. 1, 2017. (2) Cash income taxes primarily include local and state income taxes as federal income taxes will be shielded by existing net operating losses and the benefit of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 tax reform legislation that was enacted in December 2017. Dividend Payments\nOn April 30, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which is payable on Aug. 1, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 15, 2018. This will represent the 52 nd consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the Company.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today at 10 a.m. ET / 9 a.m. CT to discuss first quarter earnings and developments with respect to the Company.

(NASDAQ:CNSL) is a leading broadband and business communications provider serving consumers, businesses of all sizes, and wireless companies and carriers, across a 24-state service area. Leveraging its advanced fiber optic network spanning more than 36,000 fiber route miles, Consolidated Communications offers a wide range of communications solutions, including: data, voice, video, managed services, cloud computing and wireless backhaul. Headquartered in Mattoon, Ill., Consolidated Communications has been providing services in many of its markets for more than a century.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release, as well as the conference call, includes disclosures regarding “EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “cash available to pay dividends” and the related “dividend payout ratio,” “total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA coverage ratio,” “adjusted diluted net income per share” and “adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders,” all of which are non-GAAP financial measures and described in this section as not being in compliance with Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they should not be construed as alternatives to net cash from operating or investing activities, cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, net income or net income per share as defined by GAAP and are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, not all companies use identical calculations, and the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow.\nAdjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required by the lenders under our credit agreement in place at the end of each quarter in the periods presented. The tables that follow include an explanation of how adjusted EBITDA is calculated for each of the periods presented with the reconciliation to net income. EBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization on a historical basis.\nCash available to pay dividends represents adjusted EBITDA plus cash interest income less (1) cash interest expense, (2) capital expenditures and (3) cash income taxes; this calculation differs in certain respects from the similar calculation used in our credit agreement.\nWe present adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the related dividend payout ratio for several reasons. Management believes adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the dividend payout ratio are useful as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash (including interest on our debt) and pay dividends. In addition, we have presented adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the dividend payout ratio to investors in the past because they are frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, and management believes presenting them here provides a measure of consistency in our financial reporting. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available to pay dividends, referred to as Available Cash in our credit agreement, are also components of the restrictive covenants and financial ratios contained in our credit agreement that requires us to maintain compliance with these covenants and limit certain activities, such as our ability to incur debt and to pay dividends. The definitions in these covenants and ratios are based on adjusted EBITDA and cash available to pay dividends after giving effect to specified charges. In addition, adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the dividend payout ratio provide our board of directors with meaningful information to determine, with other data, assumptions and considerations, our dividend policy and our ability to pay dividends under the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement and to measure our ability to service and repay debt. We present the related “total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA coverage ratio” principally to put other non-GAAP measures in context and facilitate comparisons by investors, security analysts and others; this ratio differs in certain respects from the similar ratio used in our credit agreement. These measures differ in certain respects from the ratios used in our senior notes indenture.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, adjusted EBITDA does not represent the residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayment and interest payments are not deducted from such measure. Similarly, while we may generate cash available to pay dividends, we are not required to use any such cash to pay dividends, and the payment of any dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors, compliance with applicable law and the terms of our credit agreement. Because adjusted EBITDA is a component of the dividend payout ratio and the ratio of total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA, these measures are also subject to the material limitations discussed above. In addition, the ratio of total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA is subject to the risk that we may not be able to use the cash on the balance sheet to reduce our debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Management believes these ratios are useful as a means to evaluate our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nWe present the non-GAAP measures adjusted diluted net income per share and adjusted diluted net income attributable to common stockholders because our net income and net income per share are regularly affected by items that occur at irregular intervals or are non-cash items. We believe that disclosing these measures assists investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating both our company over time and the relative performance of the companies in our industry.\nPreliminary Pro Forma Results\nEstimated pro forma results of operations presented herein gives effect to the acquisition of FairPoint Communications, Inc. as if it had occurred on Jan. 1, 2016. The estimated pro forma results include certain accounting adjustments related to the acquisition that are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results, including adjustments for depreciation and amortization of the acquired tangible and intangible assets acquired, interest expense on the debt incurred to complete the acquisition and to repay certain existing indebtedness of FairPoint, the exclusion of certain acquisition related costs and the tax impact of these pro forma adjustments. These adjustments and the related results are based on a preliminary valuation of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, which is subject to change upon the final assessment and such changes could be material. The estimated pro forma information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of the combined company that would have been obtained had the acquisition been completed as of the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of the combined company.\nSafe Harbor\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions.
