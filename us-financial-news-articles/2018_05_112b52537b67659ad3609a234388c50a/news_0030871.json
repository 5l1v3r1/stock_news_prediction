But any benefit would depend on how much product overlap companies like Lupin have with the markets bigger firms are exiting, he said.\n“There are a lot of new entrants coming in,” he said, noting competition was continuing to ramp up.\nLupin’s Gupta said that while she doesn’t expect erosion in U.S. generic drug prices this year to be as bad as last year, it would still be in the high single digits.\nThe company reported a surprise loss here of 7.84 billion rupees ($115.57 million) for the quarter ended March 31, compared to a profit of 3.80 billion rupees a year earlier.\nFifteen analysts on average expected a profit of 3.20 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nResults were hit by a $227.2 million one-time expense related to impairment of some assets acquired as part of its purchase of U.S.-based Gavis Pharmaceuticals LLC. That $880 million deal struck in 2015 here was aimed at reviving U.S. growth, but price erosion has since taken a toll.\nLupin’s U.S. sales slumped about 21 percent in the quarter, while those in India were up about 14 percent.\nThe Mumbai-based company’s shares sank to a five-year low after it disclosed results, closing down 0.5 percent.
