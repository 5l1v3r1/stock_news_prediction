U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $1.20, or 0.1 percent, at $1,291.50 per ounce.\n\"A lot of people are trying to cover shorts from the break at the $1,316 level. That was a good area people were betting for the downside,\" Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors. \"Now you want to start taking some profits, because statistically, it looks like it can bounce from the short-term.\"\nGold prices barely responded to North Korea saying it might not attend the unprecedented June 12 summit with the United States if Washington continues to insist that it unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.

That is below the $1,310-$1,360 range gold has inhabited since January. \"It held up for so long on such a high level. Now you are below $1,300 and the 200-day moving average; people who hold long positions are a little bit nervous,\" she said.\nTechnical and momentum indicators suggested that gold could fall to about $1,278, ScotiaMocatta analysts said.
