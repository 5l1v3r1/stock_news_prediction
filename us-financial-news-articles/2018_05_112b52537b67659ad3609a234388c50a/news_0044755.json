Growth in the adoption of cybersecurity policies has been steady at around 20% per year for the past five years, she said.\nU.S. companies paid $2.1 billion in insurance premiums in 2017, up from $1.4 billion in 2016, according to credit-ranking company Fitch Ratings Inc. in a report released Wednesday.\nAfter revealing a large breach in 2017, Equifax Inc. has recouped from insurance $125 million of its $239 million in losses as of March 1, according to regulatory filings by the company. After FedEx Corp. experienced a NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017, the company said it incurred about $300 million in lost sales, and that it did not have cyber insurance coverage. FedEx declined to comment.\nThe two decades of actuarial data that insurers rely on is substantial enough to identify some trends, AIG’s Ms. Grella said. They include the costs associated with credit monitoring, of hiring a forensics firm and of mitigating a malware attack that destroys company equipment, she said.\nCyber insurance products vary, she said, partly because the market is segmented by industry rather than by geography and other traditional insurance factors. Historically, companies in a hurricane zone, say, might have a narrow range of flood insurance products. But the calculations aren’t as clear cut with cybersecurity, with incidents playing out differently at a health-care company, for example, than at a credit-card processor. There are differences in equipment, regulatory exposure and data collected at those firms, she said.\nCompanies should conduct detailed risk assessments before deciding on an insurance policy, Ms. Grella said. That includes determining exposure to third parties, the cost of downtime from a ransomware attack and the amount of consumer data the enterprise handles.\nWhat is cyber insurance good for? Executives and board members should think of cyber insurance as a tool to cover incidental expenses, said Nick Donofrio, a director on the boards of government contractor Mitre Corp., vehicle-technology company Aptiv PLC and others.\nPolicies can provide incident notifications as part of a so-called pre-breach package, he said, as well as access to investigators and funds to cover credit monitoring after a breach. Board members should be realistic, however, and understand that no single cyber policy will cover damages to the company’s reputation after a breach, he said.\nCompanies that most need coverage are those with exposure to credit-card risk, online processing of payments and cyber liability to executives and officers, said Gerry Glombicki, a director in Fitch’s U.S. insurance group.\nGovernment contractors also need to consider coverage, said Patrick Wylie, chief executive of Greenhat Solutions LLC, a small business that provides cybersecurity education services. Understanding the limits of cyber insurance, specifically the difficulties of translating complex security issues into legal language, didn’t deter Mr. Wylie from buying it for his business, he said. It’s necessary as a third-party to prove he can be resilient and secure enough to work with larger firms and agencies, he said.\nWrite to Kate Fazzini at kate.fazzini@wsj.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T23:11:33.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
