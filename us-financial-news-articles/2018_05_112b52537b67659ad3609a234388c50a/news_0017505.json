Warming will threaten polar ecosystems generally, including iconic wildlife like polar bears and penguins,” he said in an email.\nAround 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases is absorbed by oceans, Aronson said.\n“We have to take bold steps individually and as a society to control emissions. Shifting away from our dependence on fossil fuels would be a major step in the right direction,” he said.\n“Stabilising emissions over the next few decades could cut the rate of warming in half,” he added.\nReporting by Isabelle Gerretsen, editing by Laurie Goering.
