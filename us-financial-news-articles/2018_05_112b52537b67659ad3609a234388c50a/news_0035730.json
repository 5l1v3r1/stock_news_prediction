Yields on two-year maturities fell back to 0.05 percent compared to Wednesday’s close of 0.12 percent.\nWednesday’s spike of 16 basis points in Italian debt was its highest since March 2017, sending shockwaves through other peripheral debt at a time when concerns of a pull back in policy accomodation by the world’s major central banks and rich valuations have weighed on investors’ minds.\nThursday will offer a litmus test to whether appetite for peripheral European debt remains intact with Spain hitting the bond market on Thursday to launch a five-year benchmark bond though some investors remain bullish on the country’s outlook.\nDavid Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton said this week that he remains positive on the outlook for Spanish debt because of improving fundamentals.\nOn a year-to-date basis, Spain and Greece are the best performing bond markets this year in Europe with returns of more than 2 percent each, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nBut with U.S. and core German yields pushing higher in recent days, the headroom for yields in peripheral markets to narrow substantially from present levels is shrinking rapidly.\nIn early trading on Thursday, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a near seven-year high of 3.12 percent while yields on two-year maturities climbed to its highest since August 2008 at 2.59 percent.
