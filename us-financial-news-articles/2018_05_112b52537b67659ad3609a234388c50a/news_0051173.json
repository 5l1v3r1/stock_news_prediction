Thereafter, payouts would be tied to adjusted earnings per share that are expected to rise to 1.20 euros in 2021 from 1.00 euro this year.\nThe company said it would also consider share buybacks.\n“Over the next few years, we will continue to exhibit a growth profile that is unparalleled in our industry,” CEO Tim Hoettges said in a statement, adding that all of its group units should contribute to this growth from 2019.\nThe mid-term plan does not include the proposed merger of U.S. unit T-Mobile with Sprint. Assuming the deal closes in early 2019, the impact on Deutsche Telekom’s earnings and free cash flow would be negative through 2021.\nThe merger, which would create a No.3 U.S. carrier with 127 million customers, would bring synergies with an estimated net present value of $43 billion. It is, however, subject to regulatory approval.
