It is best known for “Surgeon Simulator” and “I Am Bread”, which have drawn in millions of users with their physics-based, realistic movements.\nIts new multiplayer online game is the first to run on the computational platform of Improbable, a second London firm which enables enormous cloud-based simulations to be created, without which Worlds Adrift’s complex, user-generated landscape would be impossible. It is far more sophisticated than prior Bossa games.\nBossa aims to create the next big European games franchise, following in the footsteps of household names such as Microsoft-owned Minecraft, Clash of Clans from Tencent-controlled Supercell, Candy Crush by Activision Blizzard’s King, and Angry Birds creator Rovio.\nTypically only established gaming companies with hundreds of engineers and hundreds of millions of dollars could develop games of the complexity of World’s Adrift which have massive creative potential and are not limited to scripted tasks.\nEight months ago, Bossa Studios raised $10 million in funding in a round led by European venture firm Atomico. It has 82 employees but is expanding rapidly with the recent funding, Olifiers said ( reut.rs/2Kvyypz ).\nImprobable, whose system can be used to digitally simulate real-world locations not just for games but in product design and corporate planning, received a $502 million investment from the Softbank Vision Fund a year ago.\nTwenty gamers play \"Worlds Adrift\", whilst suspended in a life size \"Sky Ship\" based on the game, above Chelsea College of Arts during the launch in London, Britain May 16, 2018. Luke MacGregor/Handout Bossa Studios UK via REUTERS “Unlike any other massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, your actions actually impact the virtual world - and matter,” says Improbable co-founder Herman Narula.\nGamers will build and develop increasingly complex islands which players can visit and interact with other game participants however they wish.\nIt is a massive fantasy universe designed to appeal to a younger generation of players looking to build games themselves.\nThe title is aimed at gamers reared on open-ended Minecraft, the second best-selling game of all time, which provides players with building materials to construct buildings and villages. It has attracted a sizeable number of players under the age of 15, although the majority of them are over 28 so far, Olifiers said.\nDuring development those gamers have created 10,000 islands, 450 of which will feature as the game launches in “early access” mode, meaning that it is still under construction and subject to changes. General release is expected within a year, said Olifiers, a Brazilian games journalist-turned-entrepreneur.\nPolicing the game is left to players, by design, Olifiers said. Creative contributions will be quickly mimicked by others and collaboration will be beneficial. Bad behaviour could prompt users to abandon islands where incidents take place, turning them into Robinson Crusoe outposts no one else visits.\nTwenty gamers play \"Worlds Adrift\", whilst suspended in a life size \"Sky Ship\" based on the game, above Chelsea College of Arts during the launch in London, Britain May 16, 2018.
