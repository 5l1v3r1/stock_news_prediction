It was too early to discuss the cause at this stage, he added.\n“So far the only thing for sure is that there was an accident with a Tesla,” he said, declining to say when results of the investigation are expected.\nSwiss firefighters said on Monday that the impact in a fatal accident involving a Tesla electric car may have set off a fire in the vehicle’s battery.\nA 48-year-German driver died when his car hit the barrier on the central reservation of a motorway in Ticino, rolled over and burst into flames.\nThe crash on Thursday is one of several accidents to affect Tesla vehicles in recent days.\n“The violent impact of lithium-ion batteries could probably have caused a phenomenon called ‘thermal runaway’, ie. a rapid and unstoppable increase in temperature,” the Ticino fire brigade had said on its Facebook page.\nA Tesla spokesman had said: “We are deeply saddened by this accident and we are working to establish the facts of the incident and offer our full cooperation to local authorities.”\nOn Friday a Tesla Model S crashed at speed into a truck in South Jordan, Utah.\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is also reviewing a Florida crash of a Tesla vehicle last week, resulting in the death of two teenagers.
