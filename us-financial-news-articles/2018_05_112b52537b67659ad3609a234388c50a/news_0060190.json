Col. Martin O’Donnell, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. While the strike by an artillery rocket system would disrupt Taliban operations, it would not necessarily mean any interruption to the fighting, he said.\nHowever, the attack in one of the heartlands of the Taliban insurgency was a significant blow to the insurgents, he said.
