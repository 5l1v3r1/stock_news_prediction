(NYSE: BIO and BIOb), a global leader of life science research and clinical diagnostic products, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst-quarter 2018 net sales were $551.5 million, an increase of 10.3 percent compared to $500.1 million reported for the first quarter of 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, quarterly sales increased 4.5 percent compared to the same period in 2017. First-quarter gross margin was 54.8 percent compared to 54.0 percent during the first quarter in 2017.\nLife Science segment net sales for the first quarter were $197.8 million, an increase of 13.5 percent compared to the same period in 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, Life Science segment sales increased by 8.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2017. Currency-neutral sales growth was primarily attributed to sales of Droplet Digital PCR, process chromatography, and cell biology product lines. On a geographic view, the sales increase was attributed primarily to growth in North America, Europe, and China.\nClinical Diagnostics segment net sales for the first quarter were $350.8 million, an increase of 8.9 percent compared to the same period in 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 2.4 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Currency-neutral sales from the first quarter reflected growth in immunology, diabetes, and quality control product lines. On a geographic view, the sales increase for the quarter was principally due to growth in North America and Asia Pacific.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $656.8 million, or $21.77 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $12.4 million, or $0.41 per share on a diluted basis, during the same period in 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year was significantly and favorably impacted by the recognition on the income statement of changes in the fair market value of equity securities of $815.9 million in this quarter primarily related to the holdings of our investment in Sartorius AG. Inclusion of these equity investment changes in valuation is the result of new accounting standards that became effective in 2018.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 24 percent compared to 38 percent for the same period in 2017. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to the substantial increase in income from changes in equity valuation coupled with the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective in 2018.\n“We are encouraged with the results of the first quarter, which reflect solid growth across many of our product lines and geographies,” said Norman Schwartz, Bio-Rad President and Chief Executive Officer. “This gives us good momentum for both top line growth and margin expansion as we traverse 2018.”\nGAAP Results Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Revenue (Millions) $551.5 $500.1 Gross Margin 54.8% 54.0% Operating Margin 7.9% 5.2% Net Income (Millions) $656.8 $12.4 Income per Diluted Share $21.77 $0.41 Non-GAAP Results Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Gross Margin 55.7% 57.0% Operating Margin 9.7% 7.4% Net Income (Millions) $35.4 $20.2 Income per Diluted Share $1.17 $0.68 A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this press release. Non-GAAP adjustments include amortization of purchased intangibles; acquisition-related expenses and benefits; restructuring, impairment charges and valuation changes in equity owned investments; significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs; and discrete income tax events and the income tax effect on these non-GAAP adjustments.\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share (non-GAAP EPS) are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading “Non-GAAP Reporting.” Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS also exclude certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, and significant discrete tax events.\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $35.4 million, or $1.17 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $20.2 million, or $0.68 per share on a diluted basis, during the same period in 2017. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 27 percent compared to 35 percent for the same period in 2017.\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of Bio-Rad’s reported net income and diluted income per share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 GAAP net income\n$ 656,774 $ 12,413 Amortization of purchased intangibles 6,879 6,788 Legal matters 3,679 3,538 Acquisition-related (benefits) costs (1,618 ) 600 Restructuring costs 1,038 -\nValuation change in equity-owned securities (815,934 ) -\nOther non-recurring items (9,208 ) -\nIncome tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments 193,751 (3,145 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 35,361 $ 20,194 GAAP diluted income per share $ 21.77 $\n0.41\nNon-GAAP diluted income per share $ 1.17 $ 0.68 2018 Financial Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the company continues to anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth of approximately 3.5 to 4.0 percent and improved profitability with a currency- neutral GAAP operating margin target of 10 percent. Management will discuss this outlook in greater detail on the first quarter 2018 financial results conference call.\n“The first quarter represents a good first step toward achieving our 2018 plan,” Mr. Schwartz said. “Moreover, the positive trends in our end markets coupled with the outlook for margin expansion continue to move us nicely along the path of achieving our 2020 goals,” he added.\nNon-GAAP Reporting\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, which exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain acquisition-related expenses and benefits, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, valuation changes of equity owned investments, and significant legal-related charges or benefits and associated legal costs. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS also exclude certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, and significant discrete tax events. We exclude the above items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\nWe utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures to be helpful in assessing the performance of the ongoing operation of our business. We believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. We also believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. More specifically, management adjusts for the excluded items for the following reasons:\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets: we do not acquire businesses and assets on a predictable cycle. The amount of purchase price allocated to purchased intangible assets and the term of amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition or purchase. We believe that excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our operations, and also facilitates comparisons to peer companies.\nAcquisition-related expenses and benefits: we incur expenses or benefits with respect to certain items associated with our acquisitions, such as transaction costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, gain or expense on settlement of pre-existing relationships, etc. We exclude such expenses or benefits as they are related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of our on-going business.\nRestructuring, impairment charges and valuation changes in equity owned investments: we incur restructuring and impairment charges on individual or groups of employed assets and charges and benefits arising from valuation changes in equity owned investments, which arise from unforeseen circumstances and/or often occur outside of the ordinary course of our on-going business. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financials, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods.\nSignificant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs: we may incur charges or benefits as well as legal costs in connection with litigation and other contingencies unrelated to our core operations. We exclude these charges or benefits, when significant, as well as legal costs associated with significant legal matters, because we do not believe they are reflective of on-going business and operating results.\nIncome tax expense: we estimate the tax effect of the excluded items identified above to determine a non-GAAP annual effective tax rate applied to the pretax amount in order to calculate the non-GAAP provision for income taxes. We also adjust for items for which the nature and/or tax jurisdiction requires the application of a specific tax rate or treatment.\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items excluded if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States. Investors should review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will discuss first quarter ended March 31, 2018 results in a conference call at 2 PM Pacific Time (5 PM Eastern Time) May 8, 2018.
