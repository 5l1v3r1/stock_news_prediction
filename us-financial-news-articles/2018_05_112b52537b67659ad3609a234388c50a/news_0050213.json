The roaring creatures return to cinema screens in “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”, the fifth installment in the sci-fi movie franchise which began 25 years ago.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\nMaking the sequel, eagerly awaited by fans, was a “big responsibility”, director J.A. Bayona said at a London photocall to promote the film on Thursday.\n“You really need to do something that will satisfy them, but at the same time you’re looking for something to surprise them... That’s the most challenging thing about doing a sequel,” he told Reuters.

We feature these creatures that truly at one point walked the earth, which is mind-boggling... Kids love dinosaurs and so does the kid inside the adult.”\n“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” begins its worldwide cinema rollout from June 6.
