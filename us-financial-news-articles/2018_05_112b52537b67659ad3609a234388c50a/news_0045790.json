Cunningham, currently the Chief Operating Officer of NYSE Group, began her career as a floor clerk on the NYSE trading floor in 1996 and will now become the 67 th President of the New York Stock Exchange in its 226-year history.\nAs Cunningham ascends to her new role, John Tuttle, currently the NYSE’s Global Head of Listings will become Chief Operating Officer of NYSE Group.

I’m confident that Stacey, who started as a summer intern on the NYSE floor in 1994, will continue to propel this vital institution forward. Stacey and our team are steadfastly committed to ensuring that the U.S. remains the center of world’s capital markets.”\n“John Tuttle’s track record at the NYSE over the past decade has helped drive continuous growth for our business since he joined the Exchange,” said Sprecher. “John drives results, clearly demonstrated by the resurgence of our IPO leadership, his strong relationships, and his record of delivering on the NYSE’s commitments. By centralizing our corporate listings and exchange-traded products under John, we will enhance the NYSE issuer network and provide an unparalleled level of service for our community.”\nThomas Farley joined ICE in 2007 as President and COO of ICE Futures U.S., formerly the New York Board of Trade, and joined the NYSE in 2013 when ICE acquired NYSE Euronext.
