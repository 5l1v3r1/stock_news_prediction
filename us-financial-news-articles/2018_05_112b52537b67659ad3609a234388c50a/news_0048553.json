Under the terms of the scheme of arrangement entered into between Sirtex and Varian (Varian Scheme), Varian has the right to submit a counterproposal to the CDH Proposal. Varian has formally notified Sirtex that it will not be submitting a counterproposal and that Varian is committed to the terms of the Varian Scheme at the purchase price offered by Varian of A$28 per share.\nThe board of directors of Sirtex is considering the relative merits and risks of the CDH Proposal compared to the Varian Scheme, including the respective offer prices, the risks and timing to completion and the potential outcomes for Sirtex shareholders if a control transaction does not complete. The board of directors of Sirtex has not yet formed a view on these matters and continues to unanimously support and recommend the Varian Scheme.\nVarian continues to believe that the Varian Scheme is superior to the CDH Proposal for Sirtex stockholders for the following reasons:\nThe Varian Scheme has been unanimously approved by both boards of directors, has fully committed financing and has received all necessary regulatory approvals Varian is ready to complete the acquisition following the receipt of Sirtex stockholders' approval and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions\nIn contrast, the CDH Proposal is highly uncertain:\nThe financing of the CDH Proposal is complex Varian stands ready to close the transaction upon receipt of approval from Sirtex shareholders, whereas the CDH Proposal leaves open the prospect of shareholder approval being obtained as late as March 2019 No regulatory or antitrust approvals have yet been obtained in relation to the CDH Proposal and the terms of the CDH Proposal require approval by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (US), CFIUS notification and no regulatory intervention in Australia, USA, Germany, Italy, Belgium, United Kingdom or Ireland\nVarian, consistent with previous communications remains ready, willing and able to perform its obligations pursuant to the terms of the Varian Scheme.\nAbout Varian\nVarian is a leader in developing and delivering cancer care solutions, and is focused on creating a world without fear of cancer. Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Varian employs approximately 6,500 people around the world.
