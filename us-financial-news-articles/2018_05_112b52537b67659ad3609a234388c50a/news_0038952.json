Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 215,000 in the latest week.\nThe latest figures add to a growing narrative that the labor market is approaching full employment with the jobless rate near a 17-year low of 3.9 percent. The Federal Reserve, which seeks to balance goals of maximum employment and stable prices, has forecast an unemployment rate of 3.8 percent by the end of the year.\nTighter labor markets are usually considered a bellwether of labor input wages in classical economics: When workers are in higher demand, employers will typically have to pay more for their services. Wages, in turn, are often seen as a prelude to higher prices throughout the economy as people spend more as their paychecks grow.\nRising inflation, which threatens Treasury prices because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments, puts upward pressure on rates.\n\"For the bond investor, it is proper to use the word 'ugly' when describing inflation because that's the real Achilles Heel for the bond market,\" wrote Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James. \"For a number of years, even after the U.S. economy recovered, jobs were created, and stimulus came to an end, inflation was the one variable that economists and the Fed couldn't put their finger on.\"\n\"Well, I think we have arrived at that point,\" he added. \"There is little to stand in the way of a test of 3.25 percent on the 10-year note.\" Symbol ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:31:07.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
