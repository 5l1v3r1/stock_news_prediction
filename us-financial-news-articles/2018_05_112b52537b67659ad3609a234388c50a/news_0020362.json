(TSX:PEY) (\"Peyto” or the “Company\") is pleased to present its operating and financial results for the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year. A 74% operating margin (1) and a 24% profit margin (2) in the quarter delivered an annualized 11% return on equity (“ROE”) and 8% return on capital employed (“ROCE”). Additional highlights included:\nEarnings of $0.29/share, dividends of $0.18/share. Earnings of $47 million were generated in the quarter while dividends of $30 million were paid to shareholders. Earnings per share of $0.29 were up 21% from the $0.24 in Q1 2017. The Company has never incurred a write down or recorded an impairment in its 19 year history and this quarter represents Peyto’s 53 rd consecutive quarter of earnings which is the best evidence shareholder’s capital has been invested profitably.\nFunds from operations (“FFO”) of $0.90/share. Generated $149 million in FFO in Q1 2018 up 7% from $139 million in Q1 2017 (up 6%/share). For the quarter, funds from operations exceeded the combination of capital expenditures and dividends by $84 million.\nTotal cash costs of $0.91/Mcfe (or $0.74/Mcfe, $4.43/boe, excluding royalties). Total cash costs, including $0.17/Mcfe royalties, $0.29/Mcfe operating costs, $0.13/Mcfe transportation, $0.08/Mcfe G&A and $0.24/Mcfe interest, combined with a realized price of $3.54/Mcfe, resulting in a $2.63/Mcfe ($15.80/boe) cash netback, or a 74% operating margin.\nCapital investment of $35 million . A total of 8 gross wells (7.6 net) were drilled in the first quarter, 13 gross wells (12.6 net) were completed, and 14 gross wells (13.6 net) brought on production. Over the last 12 months, new wells brought on production accounted for 34,000 boe/d at the end of the quarter, which when combined with a trailing twelve month capital investment of $403 million, equates to an annualized capital efficiency of $11,900/boe/d.\nProduction per share up 4%. First quarter 2018 production of 629 MMcfe/d (104,793 boe/d) was up 4%, on an absolute and per share basis, from 607 MMcfe/d in Q1 2017, comprised of 569 MMcf/d of natural gas and 10,043 bbls/d of oil and natural gas liquids.\nFirst Quarter 2018 in Review\nPeyto announced early in the quarter a strategic shift in its 2018 annual plans in response to the significant volatility in forecast natural gas prices. Those changes included a deferral of 2018 capital investment to later in the year when AECO natural gas prices were forecast to recover from summer lows, a reduction in the monthly dividend, a share buyback program, a term debt issuance and a market diversification strategy. These were prudent steps to postpone investment on a portion of Peyto’s lean gas inventory in order to maximize the returns from these opportunities over the longer term, while at the same time strengthening the Company’s financial position in the near term. As a result of these changes, the Company drilled only 8 wells in the quarter compared to 45 wells in Q1 2017. Capital investments combined with the reduced dividend payments represented just 44% of funds from operations for the quarter, allowing for net debt reduction of $84 million. Capital that was invested targeted liquids rich opportunities like the Cardium formation where result confirmed a significant improvement in type curve and investment return. Financial performance in the quarter remained strong with industry leading operating and profit margins delivering solid return on equity and capital employed. Peyto advanced its market diversification strategy during the quarter, with both synthetic and physical transportation agreements, as an initial step towards a corporate target of having 40% of natural gas production sold at US pricing hubs.\nOperating Margin is defined as funds from operations divided by revenue before royalties but including realized hedging gains/losses. Profit Margin is defined as net earnings for the quarter divided by revenue before royalties but including realized hedging gains/losses.\nNatural gas volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet (mcf) are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) using the ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Natural gas liquids and oil volumes in barrel of oil (bbl) are converted to thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) using a ratio of one (1) barrel of oil to six (6) thousand cubic feet. This could be misleading, particularly if used in isolation as it is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applied at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.\nThree Months Ended March 31 % 2018 2017 Change Operations Production Natural gas (mcf/d) 568,496 549,037 4 % Oil & NGLs (bbl/d) 10,043 9,586 5 % Thousand cubic feet equivalent (mcfe/d @ 1:6) 628,755 606,556 4 % Barrels of oil equivalent (boe/d @ 6:1) 104,793 101,093 4 % Production per million common shares (boe/d)* 636 613 4 % Product prices Natural gas ($/mcf) 2.86 2.96 -3 % Oil & NGLs ($/bbl) 59.67 48.14 24 % Operating expenses ($/mcfe) 0.29 0.29 - Transportation ($/mcfe) 0.13 0.17 -24 % Field netback ($/mcfe) 2.95 2.79 6 % General & administrative expenses ($/mcfe) 0.08 0.04 100 % Interest expense ($/mcfe) 0.24 0.20 20 % Financial ($000, except per share*) Revenue and realized hedging gains (losses) 200,397 187,849 7 % Royalties 9,543 10,635 -10 % Funds from operations 148,986 139,305 7 % Funds from operations per share 0.90 0.85 6 % Total dividends 29,677 54,387 -45 % Total dividends per share 0.18 0.33 -45 % Payout ratio 20 39 -49 % Earnings 47,749 40,255 19 % Earnings per diluted share 0.29 0.24 21 % Capital expenditures 35,454 153,874 -77 % Weighted average common shares outstanding 164,874,175 164,800,637 - As at March 31 End of period shares outstanding (includes shares to be issued) 164,874,175 164,874,175 - Net debt 1,243,291 1,203,988 3 % Shareholders' equity 1,725,131 1,632,390 6 % Total assets 3,762,835 3,543,556 6 % *all per share amounts using weighted average common shares outstanding\nThree Months Ended March 31 ($000 except per share) 2018 2017 Cash flows from operating activities 143,995 121,137 Change in non-cash working capital 3,913 16,160 Change in provision for performance based compensation 1,078 2,008 Funds from operations 148,986 139,305 Funds from operations per share 0.90 0.85 (1) Funds from operations - Management uses funds from operations to analyze the operating performance of its energy assets. In order to facilitate comparative analysis, funds from operations is defined throughout this report as earnings before performance based compensation, non‑cash and non‑recurring expenses. Management believes that funds from operations is an important parameter to measure the value of an asset when combined with reserve life. Funds from operations is not a measure recognized by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, funds from operations, as defined by Peyto, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers, and investors are cautioned that funds from operations should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings, cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Funds from operations cannot be assured and future dividends may vary.\nExploration & Development\nFirst quarter 2018 activity focused on the Greater Sundance areas, finishing up on the winter drilling program that began in the fall. In total, three horizontal Cardium wells were drilled and five Spirit River horizontal wells were drilled as shown in the table below. The Company continues to focus on the improved Cardium results coming from optimization of stimulation design.\nField Total\nWells\nDrilled Zone Sundance Nosehill Wildhay Ansell Berland Kisku/\nKakwa Brazeau Belly River Cardium 2 1 3 Notikewin 1 1 Falher Wilrich 2 2 4 Bluesky Total 2 2 1 3 8 Horizontal well drilling costs (per meter drilled) in Q1 2018 were in line with both 2016 and 2017. Completion costs (per meter of horizontal lateral) were also similar to 2017; however, costs per stage have continued to decrease as reduced spacing, particularly in the Cardium, has yielded superior results. The following table illustrates the progression of cost optimization designed to contribute to lower overall development costs and greater returns:\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nQ1 Gross Hz Spuds 52 70 86 99 123 140 126 135 8 Measured Depth (m) 3,762 3,903 4,017 4,179 4,251 4,309 4,197 4,229 4,091 Drilling ($MM/well) $2.76 $2.82 $2.79 $2.72 $2.66 $2.16 $1.82 $1.90 $ 1.74 $ per meter $734 $723 $694 $651 $626 $501 $433 $450 $ 425 Completion ($MM/well) $1.36 $1.68 $1.67 $1.63 $1.70 $1.21 $0.86 $1.00 $ 1.15 Hz Length (m) 1,335 1,303 1,358 1,409 1,460 1,531 1,460 1,241 1,415 $ per Hz Length (m) $1,017 $1,286 $1,231 $1,153 $1,166 $792 $587 $803 $ 810 $ ‘000 per Stage $231 $246 $257 $188 $168 $115 $79 $81 $ 61 Capital Expenditures\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Peyto invested $14 million on drilling, $17 million on completions, $4 million on wellsite equipment and tie-ins, $4 million on facilities and major pipeline projects, and $1 million on lands and seismic, for capital investments of $39.5 million. Peyto also disposed of some minor, non-producing property in the quarter for $4.0 million, reducing total capital to $35 million.\nIn addition to the 8 gross (7.6 net) horizontal wells, 13 gross (12.6 net) wells were completed and 14 gross (13.6 net) wells were equipped and tied in. Peyto also completed construction of a $3 million pipeline under the Sundance provincial park that connects the Swanson and Galloway gas plants.\nCommodity Prices\nAverage daily AECO natural gas prices were $1.97/GJ in Q1 2018, up 23% from $1.60/GJ in Q4 2017 but down 23% from $2.55/GJ in Q1 2017. This volatility was in contrast to US Henry Hub spot prices which averaged $3.08/MMBTU for the quarter, similar to the $3.01/MMBTU in Q1 2017. A change in the prioritization of gas transmission service on the NGTL system in August 2017, which severely inhibited the ability for Alberta storage reservoirs to buffer the supply/demand imbalances, has led to daily market instability and extreme volatility in AECO daily prices, predominantly during summer months. This was further compounded by a surge of basin production in the fall of 2017 combined with a lack of access to external markets beyond Western Canada, all of which has contributed to the dramatic drop in average Alberta natural gas price relative to US pricing.\nOn average for Q1 2018, Peyto realized a natural gas price of $2.49/GJ or $2.86/Mcf. This was the result of a combination of approximately 12% of natural gas production being sold in the daily or monthly spot market at an average of $1.72/GJ ($1.98/Mcf) and 88% having been pre-sold at an average hedged price of $2.62/GJ (prices reported net of TCPL fuel).\nPeyto’s Q1 2018 liquid recoveries averaged 18 bbl/mmcf with a blended, realized, oil and natural gas liquids price of $59.67/bbl, which represented 83% of the $72.09/bbl average Canadian Light Sweet posted price. Details of realized commodity prices by component are shown in the following table:\nCommodity Prices by Component\nThree Months ended March 31 2018 2017 AECO monthly ($/GJ) 1.76 2.79 AECO daily ($/GJ) 1.97 2.55 Henry Hub spot ($US/MMBTU) 3.08 3.01 Natural gas – prior to hedging ($/GJ) 1.72 2.73 ($/mcf) 1.98 3.14 Natural gas – after hedging ($/GJ) 2.49 2.58 ($/mcf) 2.86 2.96 Oil and natural gas liquids ($/bbl) Condensate ($/bbl) 72.56 60.91 Propane ($/bbl) 26.04 15.19 Butane ($/bbl) 40.83 29.12 Pentane ($/bbl) 79.26 64.60 Total Oil and natural gas liquids ($/bbl) 59.67 48.14 Canadian Light Sweet stream ($/bbl) 72.09 62.19 Peyto realized liquids price/Canadian Light Sweet 83% 77% Liquids prices are Peyto realized prices (F.O.B. plant gate) in Canadian dollars adjusted for fractionation and transportation.\nFinancial Results\nApproximately 27%, or $0.95/Mcfe, of Peyto’s revenue came from its liquids sales while 73%, or $2.59/Mcfe, came from natural gas and natural gas hedging. This liquids revenue covered all cash costs. Cash costs of $0.91/Mcfe, included royalties of $0.17/Mcfe, operating costs of $0.29/Mcfe, transportation costs of $0.13/Mcfe, G&A of $0.08/Mcfe and interest costs of $0.24/Mcfe. Cash costs were slightly higher than Q1 2017 due to increased interest rates and lower capital overhead recoveries from reduced capital expenditures. These total cash costs, when deducted from realized revenues of $3.54/Mcfe, resulted in a cash netback of $2.63/Mcfe or a 74% operating margin. Historical cash costs and operating margins are shown in the following table. Going forward, Peyto’s goal is to achieve per unit cash costs in the $0.80-$0.90/Mcfe levels for the balance of 2018.\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 ($/Mcfe) FY Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Revenue 5.04 4.17 3.81 3.80 3.58 3.24 2.92 3.16 3.38 3.44 3.36 3.24 3.50 3.54 Royalties 0.38 0.18 0.13 0.15 0.13 0.13 0.10 0.12 0.18 0.19 0.17 0.09 0.15 0.17 Operating Costs 0.34 0.32 0.31 0.28 0.25 0.23 0.26 0.25 0.26 0.29 0.24 0.26 0.28 0.29 Transportation 0.13 0.15 0.15 0.16 0.16 0.16 0.17 0.16 0.16 0.17 0.18 0.17 0.16 0.13 G&A 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.02 0.05 0.03 0.06 0.04 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.03 0.03 0.08 Interest 0.21 0.20 0.19 0.19 0.16 0.17 0.21 0.19 0.18 0.20 0.21 0.21 0.21 0.24 Total Cash Costs 1.09 0.89 0.82 0.80 0.75 0.72 0.80 0.76 0.81 0.89 0.85 0.76 0.83 0.91 Netback 3.95 3.28 2.99 3.00 2.83 2.52 2.12 2.40 2.57 2.55 2.51 2.48 2.67 2.63 Operating Margin 78% 79% 78% 79% 79% 78% 73% 76% 76% 74% 75% 76% 76% 74% Depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $1.44/Mcfe, along with a provision for deferred tax and market based bonus payments reduced the cash netback to earnings of $0.84/Mcfe, or a 24% profit margin. Dividends of $0.52/Mcfe were paid to shareholders.\nPeyto continued to protect its balance sheet from rising interest rates with the closing of another private placement of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter. On January 2, 2018 Peyto issued CND$100 million of senior unsecured notes which bear a coupon rate of 3.95% and mature on January 2, 2028. The issuance of senior notes expanded Peyto’s aggregate borrowing capacity to $1.92 billion, split into a $1.3 billion, 4 year revolver and $0.62 billion of senior unsecured notes.\nMarket Diversification and Hedging Strategy\nEarly in the first quarter Peyto announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new natural gas market diversification strategy. This was meant to complement the Company’s historically successful hedging strategy which to date has yielded over $530 million in hedging gains. The diversification strategy is designed to link 40% of Peyto’s natural gas sales to AECO based pricing, 40% to US based pricing and 20% to intra-Alberta markets. As has been Company practice, Peyto will continue to hedge future prices to smooth out the volatility in both AECO and US natural gas markets. To date, the Company has been successful initiating this marketing plan, putting in place both synthetic and physical transportation arrangements for future natural gas volumes. It is expected the above targets will be gradually achieved over several quarters through careful consideration of deal structure, long term transportation cost and market conditions.\nSpecifically in the short term, the Company has focused on the vulnerability of AECO summer prices when reduced intra-Alberta consumption requires movement of production to southern Alberta storage, a requirement that can no longer be satisfied due to insufficient Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. (“NGTL”) pipeline capacity given the migration of Alberta production to the northwest corner of the province. The current pipeline deficiencies are targeted for expansion over the next couple of years and this work should eventually correct the AECO summer pricing handicap. In the interim, Peyto has focused on near term summer diversification as well as longer term, full year diversification. The following table outlines the approximate percentage of current natural gas sales that are split by market as of May 1, 2018.\nPercentage of current gas volume* 2018\nSummer/\nWinter 2019\nSummer 2019/20\nWinter 2020\nSummer 2020/21\nWinter 2021\nSummer 2021/22\nWinter 2022\nSummer 2022/23\nWinter AECO Based Pricing 100 % 89 % 98 % 89 % 98 % 86 % 73 % 63 % 73 % Non-AECO Based Pricing - 11 % 2 % 11 % 2 % 14 % 27 % 37 % 27 % *Winter period is from November to March, summer period is April to October\nPeyto has additional initiatives in progress directed towards contracting future production volumes to strong intra-Alberta markets. There has been much discussion about Alberta’s economic diversification and the recent government announcement of two royalty incentive programs designed to stimulate investment into the development of additional petrochemical plants requiring natural gas and NGL feedstock. Peyto’s Greater Sundance asset base is geographically well situated and the concentrated collection of resource, along with pipeline, road and rail infrastructure, is a ideal source of supply for many of these projects which include petrochemical manufacturing, power generation, and NGL product upgrade. Consequently, Peyto is involved in active discussions for supply of future natural gas and NGL volumes to many of these exciting ventures.\nThe current volatility in natural gas markets in Alberta remains extremely high, reinforcing the value of Peyto’s hedging practice of layering in future sales in the form of fixed price swaps. For the balance of 2018, approximately 77% of Company forecast gas volumes have been hedged to protect against this increased AECO volatility. Peyto’s hedging program aims to achieve a fixed price on a descending, graduated schedule of up to 85% of gross production for the immediate summer or winter season and 75%, 65%, 55%, 45% and 30% targets thereafter for the successive following seasons. These fixed prices, which are settled against the AECO Monthly price, are achieved through a series of frequent transactions which are similar to “dollar cost averaging” the future gas prices in order to smooth out volatility. The following table summarizes the remaining hedged natural gas volumes and prices for the upcoming years as of May 1, 2018:\nFuture Sales Average Price (CAD) GJ Mcf $/GJ $/Mcf 2018 112,735,000 98,030,435 $2.16 $2.48 2019 71,980,000 62,591,304 $1.86 $2.13 2020 11,830,000 10,286,957 $1.80 $2.07 2021 1,970,000 1,713,043 $1.64 $1.89 Total 196,545,000 170,908,696 $2.02 $2.33 *prices and volumes in mcf use Peyto’s historic heat content premium of 1.15 .\nBoth the market diversification and hedging strategies are designed to remove the uncertainty of system access and AECO price volatility while at the same time leaving Peyto with the maximum operating margin and future market optionality.\nActivity Update\nSince the end of the first quarter, drilling and completion activity has been suspended due to spring break up. In April, Peyto finished the installation of a strategic pipeline under the Sundance provincial park which directly connects the Peyto owned and operated Swanson and Galloway gas plants. This pipeline will allow for greater operational flexibility resulting in reduced operating costs as well as increased liquids recovery.\nPeyto has also used this period of reduced activity to sharpen its drilling and well completion designs, focus on cost reduction initiatives, and acquire licenses for the post break up drilling program. The Company expects to be back drilling in early June once road bans are removed, initially starting with 3 drilling rigs focused on the Cardium resource play in the Greater Sundance area. Peyto plans to drill and bring on production another 40 to 50 Cardium locations during the remainder of 2018.\nOutlook\nDespite the outlook for weak AECO spot natural gas prices for the summer of 2018, Peyto remains bullish on the prospect for stronger pricing in the following winter season and has planned the timing of its capital program and subsequent production additions accordingly. The Company is confident that the much improved returns in its Cardium play, as a result of innovation in completion design, will support expanding capital investment going forward, even at current strip pricing. Longer term, both market diversification strategies and NGTL system expansions should help reduce the discount to AECO price further enhancing returns for shareholders. The quality of Peyto’s resource base, supported by its strategic midstream assets provides the springboard for these future opportunities.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call will be held with the senior management of Peyto to answer questions with respect to the Q1 2018 financial results on May 9 th , 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Mountain Daylight Time (MDT), or 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).

Forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the implementation of the Company's natural gas marketing diversification strategy; the progress of the Company's additional initiatives directed towards contracting future production volumes; Peyto's hedging program; the benefits of the new strategic pipeline under the Sundance provincial park; the expectation to recommencing drilling in early June and the drilling program for the remainder of 2018; and pricing expectations for the winter season and the Company's capital expenditure program.\nThe forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause Peyto's actual financial results, performance or achievement in future periods to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, risks associated with: imprecision of reserves estimates; competition from other industry participants; failure to secure required equipment; changes in general global economic conditions including, without limitations, the economic conditions in North America; increased competition; the lack of availability of qualified operating or management personnel; fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange or interest rates; environmental risks; changes in laws and regulations including, without limitation, the adoption of new environmental and tax laws and regulations and changes in how they are interpreted and enforced; the results of exploration and development drilling and related activities; the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; and stock market volatility. In addition, to the extent that any forward-looking statements presented herein constitutes future-oriented financial information or financial outlook, as defined by applicable securities legislation, such information has been approved by management of Peyto and has been presented to provide management's expectations used for budgeting and planning purposes and for providing clarity with respect to Peyto's strategic direction based on the assumptions presented herein and readers are cautioned that this information may not be appropriate for any other purpose. Readers are encouraged to review the material risks discussed in Peyto's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2017 under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and in Peyto's annual management's discussion and analysis under the heading \"Risk Management\".\nThe Company cautions that the foregoing list of assumptions, risks and uncertainties is not exhaustive. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of such information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Peyto's actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits Peyto will derive there from. The forward-looking statements, including any future-oriented financial information or financial outlook, contained in this news release speak only as of the date hereof and Peyto does not assume any obligation to publicly update or revise them to reflect new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise, except as may be required pursuant to applicable securities laws.\nBarrels of Oil Equivalent\nTo provide a single unit of production for analytical purposes, natural gas production and reserves volumes are converted mathematically to equivalent barrels of oil (BOE). Peyto uses the industry-accepted standard conversion of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil (6 Mcf = 1 bbl). The 6:1 BOE ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip. It does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is not based on current prices. While the BOE ratio is useful for comparative measures and observing trends, it does not accurately reflect individual product values and might be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. As well, given that the value ratio, based on the current price of crude oil to natural gas, is significantly different from the 6:1 energy equivalency ratio, using a 6:1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value.\nNon-IFRS Measurements\nWithin this news release references are made to terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Funds from operations, funds from operations per share and netbacks do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and previous GAAP and are referred to as non-IFRS measures. Funds from operations are described in footnote 1 to the first table on page 2 of this news release. Netbacks are a non-IFRS measure that represents the profit margin associated with the production and sale of petroleum and natural gas. Netbacks are per unit of production measures used to assess Peyto's performance and efficiency. The primary factors that produce Peyto's strong netbacks and high margins are a low cost structure and the high heat content of its natural gas that results in higher commodity prices. The Company's calculation of the non-IFRS measures included herein may differ from the calculation of similar measures by other issuers. Therefore, the Company's non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similar measures used by other issuers. Non-IFRS measures should only be used in conjunction with the Company's annual audited and interim financial statements. A reconciliation of these measures can be found on pages 2 and 9 of Peyto's management's discussion and analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nPeyto Exploration & Development Corp.\nCondensed Balance Sheet (unaudited)\n(Amount in $ thousands)\nMarch 31\n2018 December 31\n2017 Assets Current assets Cash -

Nature of operations\nPeyto Exploration & Development Corp. (“Peyto” or the “Company”) is a Calgary based oil and natural gas company. Peyto conducts exploration, development and production activities in Canada. Peyto is incorporated and domiciled in the Province of Alberta, Canada. The address of its registered office is 300, 600 – 3 rd Avenue SW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2P 0G5.\nThese financial statements were approved and authorized for issuance by the Audit Committee of Peyto on May 7, 2018.\n2. Basis of presentation\nThe condensed financial statements have been prepared by management and reported in Canadian dollars in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”. These condensed financial statements do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements as at and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n(a) Significant Accounting Judgments Estimates and Assumptions\nThe timely preparation of the condensed financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingencies, if any, as at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. By their nature, estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and changes in such estimates in future years could require a material change in the condensed financial statements.\nExcept for the impact of adoption of new accounting standards as discussed in note 3 below, all accounting policies and methods of computation followed in the preparation of these financial statements are the same as those disclosed in Note 2 of Peyto’s financial statements as at and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n(b) Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nStandards issued but not yet effective\nIn January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 “Leases”, which replaces IAS 17 “Leases”. For lessees applying IFRS 16,\na single recognition and measurement model for leases would apply, with required recognition of assets and liabilities for most leases. The standard will come into effect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company’s financial statements.\n3. Changes in Accounting Policies\nIFRS 9 \"Financial instruments\"\nOn January 1, 2018, Peyto adopted IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\" as issued by the IASB. IFRS 9 includes a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets and a forward-looking 'expected credit loss' model.\nPeyto has revised the description of its accounting policy for financial instruments to reflect the new classification approach as follows:\nFinancial instruments\nOn initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at fair value. Measurement in subsequent periods depends on the classification of the financial instrument as described below:\n• Fair value through profit or loss: Financial instruments under this classification include cash and derivative assets and liabilities.\n• Amortized cost: Financial instruments under this classification include accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, dividends payable, and long-term debt.\nThe standard also provides a simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses using a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. The credit loss model groups receivables based on similar credit risk characteristics and days past due in order to estimate bad debts. The adoption of this approach did not result in a material impact to the Peyto’s financial statements due to the high credit quality of Peyto's customers.\nIFRS 15 \"Revenue from contracts with customers\"\nOn January 1, 2018, Peyto adopted IFRS 15 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much, and when revenue from contracts with customers is recognized. Peyto's revenue relates to the sale of natural gas and natural gas liquids to customers at specified delivery points at benchmark prices. Peyto adopted IFRS 15 using the modified retrospective approach. Under this transitional provision, the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 is recognized on the date of initial application as an adjustment to retained earnings. As a result of applying the requirements of IFRS 15, including the application of certain practical expedients such as the right to invoice method of measuring the Company’s progress towards complete satisfaction of its performance obligations, no changes or adjustments to the comparative financial statements were required. Refer to Note 8 for more information including additional disclosures required under IFRS 15.\nAs a result of this adoption, Peyto has revised the description of its accounting policy for revenue recognition as follows:\nRevenue associated with the sale of natural gas and natural gas liquids is measured based on the consideration specified in contracts with customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when Peyto satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. A good or service is transferred when the customer obtains control of that good or service. The transfer of control of natural gas and natural gas liquids usually coincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession.\nPeyto principally satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time. Joint venture partners are not considered customers and therefore processing and gathering recoveries related to joint operations are netted against operating expenses.\n4. Property, plant and equipment, net\nCost At December 31, 2017 5,453,072 Additions 35,454 Decommissioning provision additions 1,235 Prepaid capital (295) At March 31, 2018 5,489,466 Accumulated depletion and depreciation At December 31, 2017 (1,868,080 ) Depletion and depreciation (81,579) At March 31, 2018 (1,949,659 ) Carrying amount at December 31, 2017 3,584,992 Carrying amount at March 31, 2018 3,539,807 During the period ended March 31, 2018, Peyto capitalized $0.6 million (2017 - $2.1 million) of general and administrative expense directly attributable to production and development activities.\n5. Current and Long-term debt\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Current senior unsecured notes 100,000 - Long-term senior unsecured notes 520,000 520,000 Bank credit facility 650,000 765,000 Balance, end of the period 1,270,000 1,285,000 The Company has a syndicated $1.3 billion extendible unsecured revolving credit facility with a stated term date of October 13, 2021. The bank facility is made up of a $40 million working capital sub-tranche and a $1.26 billion production line. The facilities are available on a revolving basis. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at Canadian bank prime or US base rate, or, at Peyto’s option, Canadian dollar bankers’ acceptances or US dollar LIBOR loan rates, plus applicable margin and stamping fees. The total stamping fees range between 50 basis points and 215 basis points on Canadian bank prime and US base rate borrowings and between 150 basis points and 315 basis points on Canadian dollar bankers’ acceptance and US dollar LIBOR borrowings. The undrawn portion of the facility is subject to a standby fee in the range of 30 to 63 basis points.\nPeyto is subject to the following financial covenants as defined in the credit facility and note purchase agreements:\nLong-term debt plus the average working capital deficiency (surplus) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters adjusted for non-cash items not to exceed 3.0 times trailing twelve-month net income before non-cash items, interest and income taxes; Long-term debt and subordinated debt plus the average working capital deficiency (surplus) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters adjusted for non-cash items not to exceed 4.0 times trailing twelve-month net income before non-cash items, interest and income taxes; Trailing twelve months net income before non-cash items, interest and income taxes to exceed 3.0 times trailing twelve months interest expense; Long-term debt and subordinated debt plus the average working capital deficiency (surplus) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters adjusted for non-cash items not to exceed 55 per cent of the book value of shareholders’ equity and long-term debt and subordinated debt.\nOutstanding senior notes are as follows (includes notes due within one year):\nSenior Unsecured Notes Date Issued Rate Maturity Date $100 million January 3, 2012 4.39 % January 3, 2019 $50 million September 6, 2012 4.88 % September 6, 2022 $120 million December 4, 2013 4.50 % December 4, 2020 $50 million July 3, 2014 3.79 % July 3, 2022 $100 million May 1, 2015 4.26 % May 1, 2025 $100 million October 24, 2016 3.70 % October 24, 2023 $100 million January 2, 2018 3.95 % January 2, 2028\nOn January 2, 2018, the Company closed an issuance of CDN $100 million of senior unsecured notes. The notes were issued by way of a private placement, pursuant to a note purchase agreement and a note purchase and private shelf agreement, and rank equally with Peyto's obligations under its bank facility and existing note purchase agreements. The notes have a coupon rate of 3.95% and mature on January 2, 2028. Interest will be paid semi-annually in arrears. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of Peyto's outstanding bank debt.\nPeyto is in compliance with all financial covenants at March 31, 2018.\nTotal interest expense for the period ended March 31, 2018 was $13.4 million (2017 - $10.5 million) and the average borrowing rate for the period was 4.2% (2017 – 3.8%).\n6. Decommissioning provision\nThe following table reconciles the change in decommissioning provision:\nBalance, December 31, 2017 143,805 New or increased provisions 778 Accretion of decommissioning provision 804 Change in discount rate and estimates 457 Balance, March 31, 2018 145,844\nCurrent - Non-current 145,844 Peyto has estimated the net present value of its total decommissioning provision to be $145.8 million as at March 31, 2018 ($143.8 million at December 31, 2017) based on a total future undiscounted liability of $291.3 million ($289.7 million at December 31, 2017). At March 31, 2018 management estimates that these payments are expected to be made over the next 49 years with the majority of payments being made in years 2046 to 2067. The Bank of Canada’s long term bond rate of 2.23 per cent (2.26 per cent at December 31, 2017) and an inflation rate of 2.0 per cent (2.0 per cent at December 31, 2017) were used to calculate the present value of the decommissioning provision.\n7. Share capital\nAuthorized : Unlimited number of voting common shares\nIssued and Outstanding\nCommon Shares (no par value) Number\nof\nCommon\nShares Amount\n$ Balance, December 31, 2017 164,874,175 1,649,537 Common shares issued by private placement - - Common share issuance costs, (net of tax) - - Balance, March 31, 2018 164,874,175 1,649,537 Earnings per common share has been determined based on the following:\nThree Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Weighted average common shares basic and diluted 164,874,175 164,800,637 Dividends\nDuring the period ended March 31, 2018, Peyto declared and paid dividends of $0.18 per common share or $0.06 per common share per month, totaling $29.7 million (2017 - $0.33 or $0.11 per common share per month, $54.4 million).\nComprehensive income\nComprehensive income consists of earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”). OCI comprises the change in the fair value of the effective portion of the derivatives used as hedging items in a cash flow hedge. “Accumulated other comprehensive income” is an equity category comprised of the cumulative amounts of OCI.\nAccumulated hedging gains and losses\nGains and losses from cash flow hedges are accumulated until settled. These outstanding hedging contracts are recognized in earnings on settlement. Further information on these contracts is set out in Note 10.\n8. Revenue and receivables\nThree Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Natural Gas Sales 101,230 155,499 Natural Gas Liquid sales 53,938 41,537 Natural gas and natural gas liquid sales 155,168 197,036\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Accounts receivable from customers 51,010 67,294 Accounts receivable from realized risk management contracts 19,706 10,746 Accounts receivable from joint venture partners and other 10,262 12,202 80,978 90,242 A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable is with petroleum and natural gas marketing entities. Industry standard dictates that commodity sales are settled on the 25th day of the month following the month of production.\n9. Future performance-based compensation\nPeyto awards performance-based compensation to employees annually. The performance-based compensation is comprised of reserve and market value-based components.\nReserve based component\nThe reserves value-based component is 4% of the incremental increase in value, if any, as adjusted to reflect changes in debt, equity, dividends, general and administrative costs and interest, of proved producing reserves calculated using a constant price at December 31 of the current year and a discount rate of 8%.\nMarket based component\nUnder the market-based component, rights with a three-year vesting period are allocated to employees. The number of rights outstanding at any time is not to exceed 6% of the total number of common shares outstanding. At December 31 of each year, all vested rights are automatically cancelled and, if applicable, paid out in cash. Compensation is calculated as the number of vested rights multiplied by the total of the market appreciation (over the price at the date of grant) and associated dividends of a common share for that period.\nThe fair values were calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The principal inputs to the option valuation model were:\nMarch 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Share price $10.80- $33.80 $27.35 - $33.80 Exercise price (net of dividends) $14.40- 22.77 $22.77 - $33.47 Expected volatility 37.09% 27.39% Option life 0.75 year 0.75 year Risk-free interest rate 1.8% 0.8%\n10. Financial instruments and Capital management\nFinancial instrument classification and measurement\nFinancial instruments of the Company carried on the condensed balance sheet are carried at amortized cost with the exception of cash and financial derivative instruments, specifically fixed price contracts, which are carried at fair value. There are no significant differences between the carrying amount of financial instruments and their estimated fair values as at March 31, 2018.\nThe Company’s areas of financial risk management and risks related to financial instruments remained unchanged from December 31, 2017.\nThe fair value of the Company’s cash and financial derivative instruments are Quote: d in active markets. The Company classifies the fair value of these transactions according to the following hierarchy.\nLevel 1 – Quote: d prices in active markets for identical financial instruments. Level 2 – Quote: d prices for similar instruments in active markets; Quote: d prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3 – valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nThe Company’s cash and financial derivative instruments have been assessed on the fair value hierarchy described above and classified as Level 1.\nFair values of financial assets and liabilities\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, financial derivative instruments, due from private placement, current liabilities, provision for future performance-based compensation and long-term debt. At March 31, 2018 cash and financial derivative instruments are carried at fair value. Accounts receivable, current liabilities and provision for future performance-based compensation approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates its fair value due to the floating rate of interest charged under the credit facility.\nCommodity price risk management\nPeyto uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Peyto considers all of these transactions to be effective economic hedges for accounting purposes.\nFollowing is a summary of all risk management contracts in place as at March 31, 2018:\nNatural Gas\nPeriod Hedged – Monthly Index Type Daily Volume Price\n(CAD) April 1, 2016 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 35,000 GJ $2.10/GJ to $2.60/GJ May 1, 2016 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 20,000 GJ $2.20/GJ to $2.35/GJ July 1, 2016 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 20,000 GJ $2.28/GJ to $2.45/GJ August 1, 2016 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 25,000 GJ $2.3175/GJ to $2.5525/GJ April 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 10,000 GJ $2.585/GJ to $2.745/GJ November 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 5,000 GJ $2.92/GJ January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 Fixed Price 20,000 GJ $2.00/GJ to $2.040/GJ April 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 105,000 GJ $1.30/GJ to $2.565/GJ April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 Fixed Price 180,000 GJ $1.54/GJ to $2.625/GJ April 1, 2018 to October 31, 2019 Fixed Price 5,000 GJ $1.90/GJ April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2020 Fixed Price 10,000 GJ $1.43/GJ to $1.44/GJ November 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 Fixed Price 70,000 GJ $1.75/GJ to $1.9525/GJ November 1, 2018 to March 31, 2020 Fixed Price 5,000 GJ $1.5725/GJ April 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 Fixed Price 15,000 GJ $1.30/GJ April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 Fixed Price 75,000 GJ $1.45/GJ to $2.50/GJ November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 Fixed Price 15,000 GJ $2.02/GJ to $2.05/GJ April 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 Fixed Price 15,000 GJ $1.30/GJ April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 Fixed Price 5,000 GJ 1.64/GJ\nNatural Gas\nPeriod Hedged – Daily Index Type Daily Volume Price\n(CAD) April 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018 Fixed Price 15,000 GJ $1.54/GJ to $1.63/GJ April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 Fixed Price 40,000 GJ $1.40/GJ to $1.67/GJ As at March 31, 2018, Peyto had committed to the future sale of 217,525,000, gigajoules (GJ) of natural gas at an average price of $2.03 per GJ or $2.33 per mcf. Had these contracts been closed on March 31, 2018, Peyto would have realized a gain in the amount of $129.4 million. If the AECO gas price on March 31, 2018 were to increase by $0.10/GJ, the unrealized loss would increase by approximately $21.6 million. An opposite change in commodity prices rates would result in an opposite impact on other comprehensive income.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2018 Peyto entered into the following contracts:\nNatural Gas\nPeriod Hedged Type Daily Volume Price\n(CAD) November 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 Fixed Price 20,000 GJ $1.91/GJ to $1.99/GJ April 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 Fixed Price 15,000 GJ $1.285/ to $1.32/GJ April 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021 Fixed Price 5,000 GJ $1.64/GJ\nCrude Oil\nPeriod Hedged Type Daily Volume Price\n(CAD) July 31, 2018 to December 31, 2018 Fixed Price 100 bbl $84.03/bbl July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 Fixed Price 100 bbl $85.34/bbl 11.

Contingencies\nOn October 1, 2013, two shareholders (the \"Plaintiffs\") of Poseidon Concepts Corp. (\"Poseidon\") filed an application to seek leave of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench (the \"Court\") to pursue a class action lawsuit against the Company, as a successor to new Open Range Energy Corp. (\"New Open Range\") (the “Poseidon Shareholder Application”). The proposed action contained various claims relating to alleged misrepresentations in disclosure documents of Poseidon (not New Open Range), which claims were also alleged in class action lawsuits filed in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec earlier in 2013 against Poseidon and certain of its current and former directors and officers, and underwriters involved in the public offering of common shares of Poseidon completed in February 2012. The proposed class action sought various declarations and damages including compensatory damages which the Plaintiffs estimate at $651 million and punitive damages which the Plaintiffs estimate at $10 million, which damage amounts appear to be duplicative of damage amounts claimed in the class actions against Poseidon, certain of its current and former directors and officers, and underwriters. An application seeking leave to commence a class action lawsuit against the Company making the same allegations was also made by two Poseidon shareholders in Ontario (the “Ontario Poseidon Shareholder Action”). No steps were taken to advance these actions against the Company.\nNew Open Range was incorporated on September 14, 2011 solely for purposes of participating in a plan of arrangement with Poseidon (formerly named Open Range Energy Corp. (\"Old Open Range\")), which was completed on November 1, 2011. Pursuant to such arrangement, Poseidon completed a corporate reorganization resulting in two separate publicly-traded companies: Poseidon, which continued to carry on the energy service and supply business; and New Open Range, which carried on Poseidon's former oil and gas exploration and production business. Peyto acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of New Open Range on August 14, 2012. On April 9, 2013, Poseidon obtained creditor protection under the Companies' Creditor Protection Act.\nOn October 31, 2013, Poseidon filed a lawsuit with the Court naming the Company as a co-defendant along with the former directors and officers of Poseidon, the former directors and officers of Old Open Range and the former directors and officers of New Open Range (the “Poseidon Action”). Poseidon claimed, among other things, that the Company is vicariously liable for the alleged wrongful acts and breaches of duty of the directors, officers and employees of New Open Range. No steps were taken to advance these actions against the Company.\nOn September 24, 2014 Poseidon amended its claim in the Poseidon Action to add Poseidon’s auditor, KPMG LLP (“KPMG”), as a defendant.\nOn May 4, 2016, KPMG issued a third party claim in the Poseidon Action against Poseidon’s former officers and directors and the Company for any liability KPMG is determined to have to Poseidon. The Company was not required to defend KPMG’s third party claim.\nOn July 3, 2014, the Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with the Court against KPMG, Poseidon's and Old Open Range's former auditors, making allegations substantially similar to those in the other claims (the “KPMG Poseidon Shareholder KPMG Action”).\nOn July 29, 2014, KPMG filed a statement of defence and a third party claim against Poseidon, the Company and the former directors and officers of Poseidon. The third party claim sought, among other things, an indemnity, or alternatively contribution, from the third party defendants with respect to any judgment awarded against KPMG LLP. The Company was not required to defend KPMG’s third party claim.\nThe allegations against New Open Range contained in the claims described above were based on factual matters that pre-existed the Company’s acquisition of New Open Range.\nOn April 6, 2018, the Company entered a global settlement with all parties involved in the Poseidon related litigation. The settlement was presented to the Alberta Court of Queens Bench on May 4, 2018 for approval as part of a plan of compromise and arrangement under the Companies’ Creditor Arrangement Act. The Alberta Court approved the settlement and Plan and issued Orders dismissing Alberta actions involving Poseidon including the Poseidon Shareholder Application and the Poseidon Action against the Company. The Ontario, Quebec and United States Courts will now be asked to recognize the Alberta Court’s Orders and to dismiss the actions before them (including the Ontario Poseidon Shareholder Action against the Company). Assuming the Alberta Court Orders are recognized, the settlement will be effective and all of the actions involving Poseidon including the Poseidon Shareholder Application, the Ontario Poseidon Shareholder Action and the Poseidon Action against the Company will be dismissed. Although the contributions being made by the different defendants are confidential, Peyto’s contribution is immaterial and reflects its belief there was no merit to the claims.\nOfficers\nDarren Gee\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Tim Louie\nVice President, Land\nScott Robinson\nExecutive Vice President New Ventures & Director David Thomas\nVice President, Exploration Kathy Turgeon\nVice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Jean-Paul Lachance\nVice President, Engineering & COO Lee Curran\nVice President, Drilling and Completions Stephen Chetner\nCorporate Secretary Todd Burdick\nVice President, Production Directors\nDon Gray, Chairman\nStephen Chetner\nBrian Davis\nMichael MacBean, Lead Independent Director\nDarren Gee\nGregory Fletcher\nScott Robinson\nAuditors\nDeloitte LLP\nSolicitors\nBurnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP\nBankers\nBank of Montreal\nMUFG Bank, Ltd., Canada Branch\nRoyal Bank of Canada\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank\nBank of Nova Scotia\nAlberta Treasury Branches\nCanadian Western Bank\nNational Bank\nWells Fargo\nTransfer Agent\nComputershare\nHead Office\n300, 600 – 3 Avenue SW\nCalgary, AB\nT2P 0G5\nPhone: 403.261.6081\nFax: 403.451.4100\nWeb: www.peyto.com\nStock Listing Symbol: PEY.TO\nToronto Stock Exchange\nSource: Peyto Exploration & Development Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.peyto.com/Files/Financials/2018/Q12018MDandA.pdf", "https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/xvh25whg", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e8c9397b-0c9c-4dbc-a426-f5275a74de11"], "published": "2018-05-09T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T00:52:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
