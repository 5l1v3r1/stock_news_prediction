Snyder brings extensive experience with the global wireless community, entrepreneurship and legal expertise, and more than a decade of nonprofit leadership experience to the position.\n“The Wireless History Foundation has a rich history, representing and celebrating the men and women that brought this industry to bear,” Snyder said. “As the wireless industry shifts to become more global and companies drive innovation at a faster pace, we have a tremendous opportunity to act as a bridge between the past and the future, creating introductions and fostering relationships that will yield a stronger industry going forward.”\nSnyder, who has been involved with the WHF since 2010, is co-founder and general counsel at Fluid Market, Inc., a peer-to-peer community sharing app. She is also the founder and executive director of the mGive Foundation, a public charity dedicated to expanding and innovating the mobile channel for social good and a pioneer of charitable donations via text message. She was also founder and General Counsel of Mobile Accord, Inc., a pioneer in mobile products and services, and 9 Squared, Inc. a mobile content company subsequently acquired by the Zed Group.\n“As the Wireless History Foundation approaches its 10 th anniversary, we are excited to grow the Foundation’s impact and relevance across the ever-expanding wireless industry,” said Wireless History Foundation Board Founding Chairman Arlene Harris. “Jenifer’s impressive ability to innovate within both the wireless and nonprofit industries coupled with her knowledge and understanding of the rich history of wireless was an ideal fit for the foundation.”\nAbout the Wireless History Foundation\nThe Wireless History Foundation was established in 2008 by wireless pioneers to preserve the lessons of wireless for the benefit of future entrepreneurs and innovators. Its signature event is the Annual Hall of Fame Dinner, which provides public recognition of outstanding individuals across all segments of the wireless industry.
