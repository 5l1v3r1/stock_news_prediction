(OTCQB:IWSY), a leader in mobile and cloud-based, multi-modal biometric identity management solutions, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 Summary of Results\nRevenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased 23% to $716,000 from $928,000 in the first quarter 2017. Gross profit for the first quarter was $468,000 (65%) as compared with $666,000 (72%) in the first quarter 2017. Net loss was $3.6 million in the first quarter compared with $2.7 million in the first quarter 2017.\nRecently Announced Significant Events\nIn April ImageWare received a $730,000 order from an existing customer for additional licenses of its Biometric Engine® identification software. In January, the company brought on board David Somerville as Sr. Vice President of Sales and Marketing to help the company to navigate the expected increase in worldwide sales activity. Mr. Somerville has over 20 years of high-level experience in the sales and support of security software.\nJim Miller, Chairman and CEO of ImageWare Systems, said, “Revenues in the quarter continued to reflect primarily our legacy business. However, we did see initial orders from several of our sales partners. Thus far in 2018 we have seen our first sales, although modest, under that model from our partners CDW, Fujitsu, Extenua and Avatier. While we have limited direct visibility on when sales projects will actually close, we do know that every project is making progress and our partners have given us good reason to believe that several will close in the second quarter,” Miller concluded.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call\nThe Company will host an investor update call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 1:30pm PT (4:30pm ET).The Participant Dial-In Number for the conference call is Domestic/International 1-631-891-4304.
