Its parent company, Israel-based Delek Group did not reply to a request for comment.\nIn early 2012, Petrofac became the first foreign company for more than 70 years to operate state oil fields in Mexico, when it was awarded two integrated services contracts by Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), Mexico’s National Oil Company.\nPetrofac’s net debt was about $600 million at the end of 2017, below the $850 million it forecast. It reported a net loss of $29 million for the year.\nOilfield service companies had been hurt by weak demand as recent subdued oil prices forced explorers and producers to cut capital expenditure and defer or cancel contracts.\nAlongside oil producers, companies that drill wells, haul water and provide other services to energy exploration firms had been hit by a slump in oil prices, with benchmark Brent tumbling to about $27 a barrel in 2016 from more than $100 in 2014. It is now trading at $77.\nIn recent months, oil firms have returned to profits due to higher oil prices and the benefits of deep cost cuts they made during the downturn. But their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze and trying to cope with low profitability.\nThis has led to a wave of consolidation in the sector, with the merger of France’s Technip and U.S. rival FMC Technologies and the acquisition of Baker Hughes by GE’s oil and gas equipment and services operations.\nReporting by Clara Denina and Ron Bousso; additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:26:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
