Chance Sisco drove in three runs on a single and a bases-loaded walk, and Pedro Alvarez knocked in two more as Baltimore earned a 2-2 series split.\nJose Rondon hit a three-run home run in a losing effort for the White Sox.\nBundy (3-6) dominated Chicago as he eclipsed his previous high of 12 strikeouts. The 25-year-old allowed three runs on two hits and a walk in his second career complete game. He threw 86 of 121 pitches for strikes.\nWhite Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito (3-5) endured another bad outing as his ERA climbed from 6.42 to 7.53. He was tagged for seven runs on six hits in 1 1/3 innings. He walked three and did not record a strikeout.\nBaltimore scored four runs in the first, three in the second and two in the third to seize a 9-0 lead.\nGiolito issued back-to-back walks with the bases loaded to set the tone for what would be a long day for the White Sox. Alvarez and Craig Gentry each notched an RBI as they trotted to first base. Sisco followed with a two-run single to cap the four-run inning.\nMancini and Jones opened the second with homers to left field and right-center field, respectively. Chris Beck replaced Giolito out of the bullpen, only to issue a bases-loaded walk to Sisco that made it 7-0.\nManny Machado and Alvarez added run-scoring singles in the third.\nRondon snapped Bundy’s no-hit bid with two outs in the fourth when he belted a shot over the left field wall. The home run was Rondon’s second in nine games this season.\nBefore the game, Major League Baseball announced White Sox catcher Welington Castillo had been suspended 80 games for testing positive for the performance-enhancing substance Erythropoietin. Omar Narvaez started in Castillo’s place and went 1-for-3.\nMark Trumbo missed his second straight game for the Orioles because of right knee soreness.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:31:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
