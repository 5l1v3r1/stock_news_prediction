This is enough for tough condemnation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n“We will act aggressively and protect the interests of Russian media to the fullest extent.”\nReporting by Natalia Zinets; editing by Matthias Williams and Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:33:51.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
