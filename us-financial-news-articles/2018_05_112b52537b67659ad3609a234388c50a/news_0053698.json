Golf - European Tour - BMW PGA Championship - Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Britain - May 25, 2018 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy reacts during the second round Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nStarting the day a couple of shots behind leader Lucas Bjerregaard, McIlroy gave an iron-play masterclass and matched it with a fine putting display to card seven birdies as he moved to 12 under for the tournament.\nMcIlroy, bidding to win the European Tour’s flagship event for the second time after his 2014 triumph, was playing with Swede Alex Noren and England’s Lee Westwood with the trio not dropping a shot between them on a becalmed West Course.\nNoren is on seven under with Westwood at five under.\nThailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat played his way up the leaderboard but, like on Thursday, found water on the way to bogeying the 18th. He ended with a 69 to leave him tied with Noren and England’s Robert Rock who took the early clubhouse lead with an impressive round of 68.\nDenmark’s Bjerregaard failed to build on his opening-day 65, struggling to a one-over 73 after a double-bogey on the 18th.\nIt took a while for McIlroy to fire up his putter.\nHe failed to make birdie on the opening three holes but did so on the fourth, seventh and ninth.\nThe 29-year-old added four more birdies on his inward nine and his round could have been even better but for two disappointing pars on the par-five 17th and 18th.\nHis 36-hole total of 132 was only one shot off the record for the tournament and he will take some stopping.\n“It’s easy to get yourself in trouble here so to keep it in play for 36 holes is nice,” McIlroy said.\n“I hit it to six to eight feet on the first three holes but none of them dropped and I thought ‘here we go’ but I played great after that and I took my chances.”\nNorthern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell, named as a Ryder Cup vice captain this year, put himself in contention with a five-under 67 to climb up to six under for the tournament going into the weekend when thunderstorms are expected.
