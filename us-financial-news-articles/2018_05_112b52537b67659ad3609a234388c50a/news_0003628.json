Network operations expense includes excise taxes, including Universal Service Fund fees of $2,604, $2,672, $2,691, $2,943 and $3,157 in the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 through March 31, 2018, respectively.\n(3)\nGAAP gross profit is defined as total service revenue less network operations expense, depreciation and amortization and equity based compensation included in network operations expense.

Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by total service revenue. Management believes that Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP gross profit margin are relevant metrics to provide investors, as they are metrics that management uses to measure the margin available to the company after network service costs, in essence a measure of the efficiency of the Company's network.\n(5)\nExcludes equity-based compensation expense of $2,536, $3,084, $3,555, $3,511 and $3,595 in the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 through March 31, 2018, respectively.\n(6)\nSee schedule of non-GAAP metrics below for definitions and reconciliations to GAAP measures below.\nSchedules of Non-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted\nEBITDA represents net cash flows from operating activities plus changes in operating assets and liabilities, cash interest expense and cash income tax expense. Management believes the most directly comparable measure to EBITDA calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, is cash flows provided by operating activities. The Company also believes that EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of issuers. EBITDA, as adjusted, represents EBITDA plus net gains (losses) on asset related transactions.\nThe Company believes that EBITDA, and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful measures of its ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA, and EBITDA, as adjusted are an integral part of the internal reporting and planning system used by management as a supplement to GAAP financial information. EBITDA, and EBITDA, as adjusted are not recognized terms under GAAP and accordingly, should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of results as reported under GAAP, but rather as a supplemental measure to GAAP. For example, these metrics are not intended to reflect the Company's free cash flow, as it does not consider certain current or future cash requirements, such as capital expenditures, contractual commitments, and changes in working capital needs, interest expenses and debt service requirements. The Company's calculations of these metrics may also differ from the calculations performed by its competitors and other companies and as such, its utility as a comparative measure is limited.\nEBITDA, and EBITDA, as adjusted, are reconciled to cash flows provided by operating activities in the table below.\nQ1\n2017\nQ2\n2017\nQ3\n2017\nQ4\n2017\nQ1\n2018\n($ in 000's) â€“ unaudited\nNet cash flows provided by operating\nactivities\n$23,514\n$28,045\n$28,783\n$31,360\n$30,179\nChanges in operating assets and\nliabilities\n3,192\n950\n721\n300\n2,919\nCash interest expense and income tax\nexpense\n11,021\n11,104\n10,700\n11,583\n10,994\nEBITDA\n$37,727\n$40,099\n$40,204\n$43,243\n$44,092\nPLUS: Gains on asset related transactions\n2,124\n1,023\n397\n319\n117\nEBITDA, as adjusted\n$39,851\n$41,122\n$40,601\n$43,562\n$44,209\nEBITDA margin\n32.2%\n33.5%\n32.7%\n34.5%\n34.3%\nEBITDA, as adjusted, margin\n34.0%\n34.3%\n33.0%\n34.8%\n34.3%\nConstant currency revenue is reconciled to service revenue as reported in the tables below.\nConstant currency impact on revenue changes â€“ sequential periods\n($ in 000's) â€“ unaudited\nQ1\n2017\nQ2\n2017\nQ3\n2017\nQ4\n2017\nQ1\n2018\nService revenue, as reported â€“\ncurrent period\n$117,203\n$119,777\n$122,969\n$125,226\n$128,706\nImpact of foreign currencies on\nservice revenue\n195\n(531)\n(1,701)\n16\n(981)\nService revenue - as adjusted\nfor currency impact (1)\n$117,398\n$119,246\n$121,268\n$125,242\n$127,725\nService revenue, as reported â€“\nprior sequential period\n$115,596\n$117,203\n$119,777\n$122,969\n$125,226\nConstant currency increase\n$1,802\n$2,043\n$1,491\n$2,273\n$2,499\nConstant currency percent\nincrease\n1.6%\n1.7%\n1.2%\n1.8%\n2.0%\n(1)\nService revenue, as adjusted for currency impact, is determined by translating the service revenue for the current period at the\naverage foreign currency exchange rates for the prior sequential period.

The statements in this release are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Cogent's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences, including future economic instability in the global economy or a contraction of the capital markets which could affect spending on Internet services and our ability to engage in financing activities; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to USD and Canadian dollar to USD exchange rates) on the translation of our non-USD denominated revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the US Universal Service Fund on the basis of our Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation, including net neutrality rules by the United States Federal Communications Commission and in the area of data protection; increasing competition leading to lower prices for our services; our ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on our network; the ability to maintain our Internet peering arrangements on favorable terms; our reliance on an equipment vendor, Cisco Systems Inc., and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; the dependence of our network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber providers; our ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of our revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; and outcomes in litigation as well as other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
