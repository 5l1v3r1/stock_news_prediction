Euro zone money markets now price roughly a 75 percent chance of a 10 basis point hike from the European Central Bank by mid-2019, scaling back bets on a rate rise given a softening in economic data and inflation.\nAfter falling 0.3 percent to $1.1823 versus the dollar, its lowest in 2018, the euro recovered to trade up 0.2 percent at $1.1883.\nThe euro has lost one percent of its value in May as investors betting on a falling dollar were caught out and rushed to cover their positions, further pushing the greenback higher.\nThe dollar index fell 0.2 percent from a 2018 high to 92.959 .\nAgainst the yen, the dollar rose half a percent to 109.675 .\nTrump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of the deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.\nSentiment towards the euro cooled after Italian President Sergio Mattarella’s call to bickering political parties to rally behind a “neutral government” were met with immediate opposition and raised the prospect of elections being held as early as July.\n“Solid U.S. inflation data tomorrow and the expected dovish comments of ECB President Mario Draghi in Florence on Friday following the recently disappointing data from the euro zone point towards a continuation of the downtrend in euro/dollar,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\nThe Swedish crown, one of the worst performing G10 currencies in 2018, moved sharply higher as investors unwound positions. The crown rose 1 percent against the dollar and 0.9 percent against the euro.\nThe Swiss franc, traditionally a safe-haven currency, fell 0.1 percent versus the dollar but gained 0.1 percent against the euro. It had hit a three-week high against the euro on Tuesday.
