Dahl followed with his first of the year to make it 2-0 after just 10 pitches by the Cubs’ starter.\nRizzo cut the lead in half with his second home run of the season on the first pitch from Gray leading off the bottom of the first. Arenado stretched the lead back to two when he homered in the fourth, his fifth of the season.\nGray (3-4) retired nine in a row after Rizzo’s home run and worked out of a couple of jams. Kris Bryant led off the fourth with a single and Ben Zobrist walked but Gray got the next three batters to end the threat.\nChicago had another good scoring chance in the seventh inning when Kyle Schwarber hit a one-out triple to right. Gray then struck out Victor Caratini on a high fastball and got Jason Heyward to pop out to catcher Tony Wolters behind home plate.\nIt was the second straight strong start for Gray after three rough outings. He struck out 11 and didn’t allow a run in six innings against San Diego on April 25 and followed that by striking out six and allowing one run on three hits Tuesday.\nHendricks (2-2) was almost as effective as Gray but was a hard-luck loser. He allowed three runs on four hits, struck out five and walked two. He left after issuing a two-out walk to Blackmon in the eighth inning after throwing 104 pitches.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:57:42.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
