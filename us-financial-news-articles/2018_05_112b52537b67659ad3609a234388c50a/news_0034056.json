REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\nAnalysts are on average expecting Thomas Cook to post operating profit of 352 million pounds for the 12 month period to Sept. 31, which would represent a 7 percent rise on last yearâ€™s result.\nThomas Cook said that in Britain, the smaller part of its business in revenue terms compared to its bigger divisions in the Nordics and Germany, France and Belgium, margins were under pressure due to adverse currency moves and hotel cost inflation.\nIt was mitigating this pressure by shifting holidays from Spain to destinations like Greece and Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nFor its first-half, which includes its weaker winter season when fewer Europeans take holidays, Thomas Cook on Thursday posted an underlying loss from operations of 169 million pounds, a 5 percent improvement on last year.\nThat was buoyed by strong demand for holidays to Egypt and long-haul destinations, improving its first-half performance.\nThomas Cook also said on Thursday that it would scrap its Club 18-30 holiday brand.
