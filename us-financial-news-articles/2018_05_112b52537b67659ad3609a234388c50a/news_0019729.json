(TSX:MRD), an Alberta-based real estate development and asset management company, today reported results for the 2018. Revenue for the quarter was $44.41 million, up 15% over Q1-2017. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales in the Community Development division which led to a 54% increase in divisional revenue coupled with stable results in our income-producing divisions.\nNet income for the quarter was $14.65 million or $0.44 per share (basic) compared with a net loss of $9.00 million or $0.27 per share (basic) in the same period of 2017. Net income is impacted by non-cash fair value adjustments on investment properties on investment properties and on REIT units. Funds from operations (FFO) was was $4.92 million or $0.15 per share compared with\n$6.08 million or $0.18 per share in the same period of 2017. The decrease compared with last year is primarily due to current taxes payable resulting from the sale of assets to Melcor REIT. FFO eliminates the elements that have no cash impact on our business from net income and management believes FFO better reflects Melcor's true operating performance.\nDarin Rayburn, Melcor’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter: “We are encouraged by our first quarter results in spite of continued economic uncertainty. Multi-family and commercial land activity in the quarter drove revenue growth. In addition, strategic investments made in residential land in the US have begun to bear fruit with the sale of 154 single-family lots in Arizona in the quarter contributing to both revenue growth and gross margin improvements.\nThe performance of our income-producing portfolio remained steady in the quarter and we continued to execute our strategy of monetizing the value created by our property development team with the sale of 5 assets from Melcor Developments to the Melcor REIT for $80.88 million. With a strong balance sheet and high quality assets and raw land inventory, we remain well-positioned for 2018 and beyond.\"\nThe Board today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2018. The dividend is an eligible dividend for Canadian tax purposes.\nFirst Quarter Results\nOur Community Development and Property Development divisions are actively engaged in a number of projects as we enter the 2018 construction season. Our Property Development team transferred 35,365 sf in GLA to our Investment Properties division during the quarter and has a further 93,500 sf of commercial properties currently under construction.\nHighlights of the first quarter include:\nWe completed the sale of five commercial properties (172,629 sf of owned GLA) to the REIT for $80.88 million. This represents our fourth asset sale to the REIT and demonstrates how our value chain enables the monetization of value created through the development of commercial properties. Concurrent with the transaction, the REIT generated $17.30 million from the issuance of trust units. Revenue grew 15% to $44.41 million compared with Q1-2017. This growth was driven by the 54% growth in Community Development division revenue. The Investment Properties and REIT division continue to produce stable results with consistent occupancy and base rents. Net income of $14.65 million in the quarter was positively impacted by non-cash fair value gains on investment properties of $2.07 million and on REIT units of $5.39 million. These gains are primarily driven by market forces outside of Melcor's control. Funds from operations were down 19% to $4.92 million compared with last year primarily due to taxes triggered on the asset sale to the REIT. On January 31, 2018 the REIT disposed of a commercial property in Leduc, Alberta for $6.73 million (net of transaction costs). Melcor also sold 2 residential units in the US for cash proceeds $0.52 million.\nWe paid a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share on March 29, 2018. The REIT paid distributions of $0.05625 per trust unit in January, February and March for a quarterly payout ratio of 96%. On May 8, 2018 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2018. The dividend is an eligible dividend for Canadian tax purposes.\nSelected Highlights\n($000s except as noted) Three months ended\n31-Mar-18 31-Mar-17 Change Revenue 44,414 38,567 15.2 % Gross margin (%) * 51.7 % 48.6 % 3.1 % Net income (loss) 14,647 (9,003 ) 262.7 % Net margin (%) * 33.0 % (23.3 )% 56.3 % Funds from operations * 4,920 6,078 (19.1 )% Per Share Data ($) Basic earnings (loss) 0.44 (0.27 ) 263.0 % Diluted earnings 0.44 (0.27 ) 263.0 % Funds from operations * 0.15 0.18 (16.7 )%\nAs at ($000s except as noted) 31-Mar-18 31-Dec-17 Change Shareholders' equity 1,022,867 1,008,590 1.4 % Total assets 1,955,845 1,990,983 (1.8 )% Per Share Data ($) Book value * 30.63 30.21 1.4 %\nMD&A and Financial Statements\nInformation included in this press release is a summary of results.
