Sales rose 0.8 percent when adjusted for currency effects.\nThe operator of Media Markt and Saturn stores, which split from German retail conglomerate Metro last July, said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 18 million euros, after a loss of 19 million in the same period last year.\nCeconomy kept its forecast for at least medium single-digit percentage growth in annual operating profit and a slight increase on sales of 22.16 billion euros last year.
