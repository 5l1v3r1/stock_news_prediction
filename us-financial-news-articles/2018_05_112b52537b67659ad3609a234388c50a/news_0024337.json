The government is running out of time to find a toll operator from January 2020 when the current contract ends.\n$1 = 21.5620 Czech crowns Reporting by Jan Lopatka\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:18:52.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
