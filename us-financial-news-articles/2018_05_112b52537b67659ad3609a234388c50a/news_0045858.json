It says the crackdown is needed for security reasons.\n“The two players contacted us and the DFB and wanted to clear this issue up,” Germany coach Joachim Loew told reporters.

Now we can start talking about other things.”\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier posted a photo on Facebook showing him with the two soccer players in front of his office at the Bellevue Castle in Berlin. “It was important to both of them to clear up the misunderstandings,” Steinmeier said in the posting.\nHe said the two players’ life stories reflected what he had said in a speech on German unification day, in which he reminded Germans that people could have “more than one homeland.”\nThe German president said Ozil had told him he stood by Germany, where he had grown up, while Gundogan said that although Turkey was important to him as his parents’ homeland, “Germany is clearly my country and my team.”\nLoew has called up the pair in his preliminary squad for their title defense at next month’s World Cup in Russia.\n“Both assured us that they had not wanted to send any political signal with that action,” DFB President Reinhard Grindel said.\n“They also stated that they stand for our values on and off the pitch and that they identify with them.” Reporting by Karolos Grohmann, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T23:28:19.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
