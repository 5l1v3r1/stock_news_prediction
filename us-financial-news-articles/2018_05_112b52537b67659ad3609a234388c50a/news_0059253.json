(TSXV:AHI) (“ Agility Health ” or “ Corporation ”), a leading provider of orthotics, prosthetics and foot care services in Canada, announces that it expects a delay of approximately 30 days in filing its first quarter financial statements, management’s discussion and analysis and related officer certifications for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (collectively, the \" Quarterly Financial Filings \") which are required to be filed on May 30, 2018 (the “ Filing Deadline ”). Due to the current delay in filing its annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “ Annual Financial Filings ”), as announced in a press release dated April 27, 2018, the Corporation is unable to complete the Quarterly Financial Filings by the Filing Deadline while concurrently working with its auditors to complete the Annual Financial Filings. The Corporation continues to work diligently with its auditor to ensure that it has all the necessary information to complete the audit of the Annual Financial Filings.\nThe Corporation is providing this default announcement and status update in accordance with National Policy 12-203 - Management Cease Trade Orders (“ NP 12-203 ”). The Ontario Securities Commission issued a management cease trade order (“ MCTO ”) under NP 12-203 on May 1, 2018 in connection with the late filing of the Corporation’s Annual Financial Filings. The MCTO restricts trading in securities of the Corporation by the Corporation’s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The issuance of the MCTO generally will not affect the ability of persons who have not been directors, officers or insiders of the Corporation to trade in their securities. The MCTO will be in effect until the Corporation has completed its Quarterly Financial Filings.\nThe Corporation intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines set out in sections 9 and 10 of NP 12-203 so long as the Quarterly Financial Filings are outstanding, including the issuance of bi-weekly default status reports in the form of news releases.\nThe Corporation confirms as of the date of this news release that there is no insolvency proceeding against it and there is no other material information concerning the affairs of the Corporation that has not been generally disclosed.\nAbout Agility Health\nThrough its Canadian subsidiary and principal operating entity, Medic Holdings Corp., Agility Health operates eleven (11) foot care clinics in Ontario and Quebec and manufactures orthotics and prosthetics.\nForward-Looking Information\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nThis release includes forward-looking statements regarding Agility Health and its business.
