Prosecutors said he defaced the website by having it display the words “Hacked by AlfabetoVirtual,” his pseudonym.\nAnderson allegedly also hacked the website of New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer in July 2015, causing it to display “Hacked by AlfabetoVirtual,” “#FREEPALESTINE” and “#FREEGAZA.”\nWhile the complaint focused on these two incidents, it said Anderson also committed more than 11,000 other defacements of “various U.S. military, government, and business websites around the world” using the pseudonym AlfabetoVirtual.”\nA defacement involves a hacker infiltrating a website and replaces its public content with his or hers own.\nAnderson is charged with three counts of computer fraud.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:43:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
