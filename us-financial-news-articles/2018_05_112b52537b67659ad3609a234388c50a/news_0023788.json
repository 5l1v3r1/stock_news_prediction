The accident happened at 3 a.m. on Wednesday, the safety bureau said.\nThe cause of the accident is under investigation, said the municipal government of Shaoyang, the city near where the mine is located.\nThe coal mine is owned by Hunan Baodian Group, which is 40 percent owned by the municipal asset manager for the city of Shaoyang with China Guodian Group holding the rest. Guodian has made several attempts to sell its stake in the coal mine to private investors since 2014, according to filings with the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange, a state-owned assets auction house.\nThe explosion is the first major coal mine accident this year and might lead to tighter scrutiny on coal mine safety practices.\nChina’s coal production in March fell to its lowest since October, data from the National Bureau of Statistic showed, as miners in the world’s top consumer of the fuel scaled back operations amid falling prices.\nReporting by Meng Meng and Tom Daly; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T07:46:46.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
