Citrix assumes any forward-looking information contained in this press release or with respect to the announcements described herein.\nFree cash flow is operating cash flow determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.\nNon-GAAP operating margin differs from GAAP operating margin in that it excludes certain GAAP measurements in accordance with the Company’s past practices, including amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, non-cash charges associated with the expensing of equity-based compensation, non-cash charges related to amortization of debt discount, accruals related to patent litigation, charges related to the company’s restructuring programs, charges related to separation activities, and the tax effects related to these items. The company is unable to provide 2022 GAAP operating margin or a reconciliation of 2022 GAAP to non-GAAP operating margin without unreasonable effort due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from non-GAAP operating margin in future periods.\nCitrix® is a trademark or registered trademark of Citrix Systems, Inc. and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, and may be registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in other countries.
