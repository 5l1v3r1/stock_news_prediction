Iran and Hezbollah deny any involvement in Bahrain’s unrest.\nReporting By Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-13T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T18:44:53.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
