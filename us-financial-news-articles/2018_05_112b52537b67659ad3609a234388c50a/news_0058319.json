The canvas was pierced in three places in the central part of the work which depicts the figure of the tsarevich (the tsar’s son).”\nThe frame was also badly damaged, the gallery said, but it said that “by a happy coincidence” the most precious elements of the painting — the depiction of the faces and hands of the tsar and his son — were not damaged.\nVODKA Police sources told Russian news agencies that the attacker, who was detained and now faces being charged with damaging a cultural artefact, was a 37-year-old man from the city of Voronezh about 460 kilometers (286 miles) from Moscow.\nIn a video released by the interior ministry, the man confessed to attacking the painting and said he recognized the seriousness of his crime.\n“I came to look at the painting,” the man, who was not named, told the police.\n“I wanted to leave, but then dropped into the (gallery’s) buffet and drank 100 grams of vodka. I don’t drink vodka and became overwhelmed by something.”\nSome Russian media cited him as saying he had attacked the painting because he thought its depiction of Russian history was inaccurate.\nRussian nationalists who object to the painting and dispute its veracity have previously demanded the gallery remove it from display, something the Tretyakov has refused to do.\nThe canvas was also attacked in 1913 by a mentally disturbed man who slashed it with a knife three times. Repin, the painting’s creator, was still alive at the time and personally restored it.\nEditing by Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T21:34:13.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
