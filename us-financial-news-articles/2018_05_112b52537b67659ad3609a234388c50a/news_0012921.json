(NYSE:WAIR), one of the world's leading distributors and providers of comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace industry, today announced results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Highlights\nNet sales of $390.2 million, up 7.0 percent Net income of $15.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share Adjusted net income (1) of $22.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (1) (EBITDA) of $45.0 million, or 11.5 percent of net sales\nTodd Renehan, chief executive officer, said, “Progress on Wesco’s improvement initiatives has driven better operating and financial performance for the second quarter in a row, a testament to the hard work of our people and ongoing support of our customers. We reported solid sales growth in the quarter, with increases in both ad-hoc sales and long-term contracts. We also continued to win new business and renew long-term contracts, reflecting our robust value proposition. We maintained our focus on selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter; apart from consulting costs incurred to support Wesco 2020, expenses were consistent with the previous quarter.\n“While I’m pleased with the progress made in our performance so far this year, we still have gaps in our execution. We launched Wesco 2020 in the fiscal 2018 second quarter to address these gaps and deliver stronger results. In addition, the significant financial benefits expected through Wesco 2020 will allow us to invest in the capabilities we need to continue supporting our customers and deliver long-term value to shareholders. Ultimately, we believe Wesco 2020 will enable the company to maintain high levels of service excellence, manage inventory more effectively and leverage our infrastructure to support profitable growth.”\nWesco 2020 Launch\nIn a separate press release issued today, the company announced the launch of Wesco 2020, Building the Future, focused on service excellence, inventory management and profitable growth. Wesco 2020 is expected to deliver significant operational and financial benefits through footprint alignment, organizational refinement, productivity gains and investment in critical capabilities to serve customers better.\nWesco 2020 is expected to deliver annualized pre-tax benefits of at least $30 million; benefits realization is expected to start in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with the run-rate improving steadily as the year progresses. The company expects to incur non-recurring costs associated with Wesco 2020 approximately equal to the run-rate benefit over the implementation period.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Results\nNet sales of $390.2 million in the fiscal 2018 second quarter were 7.0 percent higher than the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in long-term contracts and growth in ad-hoc sales. The increase in contract sales primarily reflects new business revenue and higher hardware and chemical volume with existing customers. Ad-hoc sales growth was primarily due to increases at key customers.\nGross profit was $105.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $94.8 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. The increase in gross profit compared to the same period last year was primarily due to higher sales volume and the impact from lower provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and inventory adjustments.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses totaled $72.5 million in the fiscal 2018 second quarter compared with $62.6 million in the same period last year. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to staff additions in the second half of fiscal 2017 to stabilize the business and support growth, as well as consulting costs of $4 million in the fiscal 2018 second quarter associated with the launch of Wesco 2020.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 18.6 percent in the fiscal 2018 second quarter, compared with 17.2 percent in the same period last year.\nIncome from operations totaled $33.2 million, or 8.5 percent of net sales, in the fiscal 2018 second quarter, compared with $32.2 million, or 8.8 percent of net sales, in the same period last year. The increase in income from operations reflects higher gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.\nNet income was $15.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2018 second quarter. This compares with net income of $17.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Adjusted net income (1) was $22.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared with $21.1 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) in the fiscal 2018 second quarter was $45.0 million, compared with $39.0 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) was 11.5 percent, compared with 10.7 percent in the same period last year.\nFiscal 2018 Year-to-Date Results\nNet sales were $753.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, an increase of 7.0 percent compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher long-term contracts and ad-hoc sales.\nIncome from operations totaled $57.8 million, or 7.7 percent of net sales, in the first six months of fiscal 2018. This compares with $58.5 million, or 8.3 percent of net sales, in the same period last year. The decline in income from operations primarily reflects an increase in SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit.\nNet income was $14.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with $30.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net income in the fiscal 2018 year-to-date period includes income tax expense of $9.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, associated with the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Adjusted net income (1) was $36.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in the fiscal 2018 year-to-date period, compared with $39.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) in the fiscal 2018 year-to-date period was $80.0 million, or 10.6 percent of net sales, compared with $73.3 million, or 10.4 percent of net sales, in the fiscal 2017 year-to-date period.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $35.9 million in the fiscal 2018 year-to-date period, compared with $33.8 million in fiscal 2017 year-to-date. Free cash flow (1) was negative $38.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with negative free cash flow (1) of $38.0 million in the same period last year.\nConference Call Information\nWesco Aircraft will hold a conference call to discuss its fiscal 2018 second quarter results at 2:00 p.m. PDT (5:00 p.m. EDT) today, May 3, 2018.

Wesco Aircraft believes these metrics are used in the financial community, and the company presents these metrics to enhance understanding of its operating performance. Readers should not consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income as alternatives to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See the tables following this press release for reconciliations of adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements (including within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.
