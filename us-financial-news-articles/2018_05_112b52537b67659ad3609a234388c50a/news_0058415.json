That helped reduce its LNG consumption by 16.3 percent to 7.56 million tonnes.\nThe utility will adjust LNG volumes by first cutting spot and short-term LNG purchases, which now account for about 20 percent of total, Shingo Shimada, general manager of fuel planning group, told Reuters in an interview.\n“We see LNG requirements to be declining slightly,” Shimada said when asked whether the company’s still keen on signing new long-term LNG contracts.\n“That is because it’s difficult to project demand due to the power liberalization and the restart of nuclear plants. We have to be cautious on that.”\nKansai Electric expects to boost the ratio of nuclear, hydro and renewables in its power generation mix to more than 50 percent of total in the future, from about a quarter in the year ended March 31, with the most increase coming from nuclear energy.\nIn existing long-term LNG supply deals, Shimada said the company will work to remove destination clauses that restrict where the cargoes can be sold, but added that negotiations with sellers would take time.\nThe world’s top LNG buyer, Japan’s JERA Co, and Tokyo Gas have won flexible destination clauses from Malaysia’s Petronas in new long-term contracts that are in line with the Japanese anti-trust body’s ruling last year that declared the destination restrictions to be anti-competitive.\nKansai Electric expects to raise the ratio of free-on-board contracts from about 20-30 percent now to boost its trading flexibility, Shimada said.\nReporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:26:31.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
