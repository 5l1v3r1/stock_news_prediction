But really we’re headed in the right direction and I think that’s really pleasing for the players.”\nTheir victory over the Queensland Reds last week was a 63-28 thrashing but overcoming the Stormers 26-23 in the sweltering Hong Kong heat — their first win away from the Japanese capital — required a drop goal after the hooter from Hayden Parker.\nThe flyhalf applied the finishing touch but that he was in the position to do so was the result of the never-say-die attitude of the Sunwolves team, who had to turn over the ball and march 70 metres down the pitch to get into range.\n“They worked their way up the field and it was exceptional brilliance that won the game — well played,” Stormers coach Robbie Fleck admitted.\nThe Jaguares could yet challenge for the playoffs and if the Sunwolves can stay in more games until the last 10 minutes, the Reds might not be the only one of their Australian conference rivals to taste defeat at the hands of the Japanese this season.
