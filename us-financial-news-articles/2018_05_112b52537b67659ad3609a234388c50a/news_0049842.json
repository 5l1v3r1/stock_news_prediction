Digital revenue accounted for 16 percent of the company’s total in fiscal 2017.\nAristocrat’s revenue from ordinary activities for the six months rose about 29 percent on the prior year.\nThe company had snatched up two mobile game developers last year, in an effort to diversify its business through a larger online presence. Seattle-based Big Fish Games, the more recent of the two acquisitions, had cost the company about $990 million.\nAristocrat shares have outperformed major peers like Ainsworth Game Technology and Crown Resorts in 2018 on great expectations from its foray into the mobile gaming space.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of 19 cents per share, compared to 14 cents per share a year ago.
