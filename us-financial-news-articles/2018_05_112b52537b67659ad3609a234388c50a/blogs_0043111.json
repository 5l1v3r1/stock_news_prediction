In 2016, it bought business software firm Deltek for $2.8 billion.\nThoma Bravo bought PowerPlan, which provides tax, regulatory and budgeting solutions to businesses, in 2015 from investors JMI Equity and TPG Growth for an undisclosed price.\nRoper’s current deal, which will immediately add to the company’s free cash flow, is likely to be funded by both existing credit and cash on hand.\nDuring the first 12 months of ownership, Roper expects PowerPlan to generate about $150 million of revenue and $60 million of after-tax free cash flow.\nThe Lakewood Ranch, Florida-based Roper said the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval.\nReporting by Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:57:37.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
