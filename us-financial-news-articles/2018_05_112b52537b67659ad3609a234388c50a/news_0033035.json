Revenues amounted to $225.3 million, representing a 13.7% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017.

The increase is mainly attributable to the improved performance in Kaxu during the summer season in South Africa, with a capacity factor of 37.0%. Production also increased in our U.S. solar assets, mainly due to a temporary delay of the annual maintenance work in Mojave to the second quarter of 2018. The solar fleet in Spain demonstrated stable operational results. Finally, our wind assets increased production due to solid performance and good wind levels.\nOur availability-based assets continue to deliver solid performance with high availability levels in ACT, transmission lines and in water assets.\nLiquidity and Debt\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash available at the Atlantica Yield corporate level was $151.4 million, which together with an available revolver capacity of $71.0 million, represents total corporate liquidity of $222.4 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, net project debt amounted to $4,929.2 million ($4,954.3 million as of December 31, 2017) and net corporate debt amounted to $505.9 million ($494.6 as of December 31, 2017). The net corporate debt / CAFD pre-corporate debt service ratio [8] remains at 2.3x.\nNet project debt is calculated as long-term project debt plus short-term project debt minus cash and cash equivalents at the project level. Net corporate debt is calculated as long-term corporate debt plus short-term corporate debt minus cash and cash equivalents at Atlantica Yield corporate level.\nRevolving Credit Facility Refinancing\nOn May 10, 2018, we signed a $215 million new Revolving Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks. The agreement, once effective, will replace the current $125 million Revolving Credit Facility ahead of its maturity in December 2018.\nThe new Revolving Credit Agreement matures on December 31, 2021 and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.60% to 2.25%, depending on corporate leverage. Considering our corporate debt target, we expect the margin to be in the range of 1.60% to 1.75%, which is around 100 basis points lower than the rate of the current revolving arrangement.\nDividend\nOn May 11, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.32 per share which represents a 28% increase compared to the same quarter of 2017. This dividend is expected to be paid on or about June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 31, 2018.\nStrong Commitment from Algonquin\nOn March 9, 2018, Algonquin became our largest shareholder after closing the acquisition of a 25% equity participation in Atlantica Yield. Furthermore, on April 17, 2018, Algonquin announced they had entered into an agreement with Abengoa to purchase an additional 16.5% of our shares. The transaction is subject to approval by the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\") and certain other closing conditions and is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2018, according to the information publicly disclosed by Algonquin.\nAlgonquin is demonstrating a strong commitment to Atlantica and our future accretive growth. With solid know-how in the sector, an investment grade credit rating and proven access to capital markets, their equity participation in Atlantica assures a compelling alignment between the two companies. Following the closing of the 25% stake acquisition, Mr. Ian Robertson, CEO of Algonquin and Mr. Christopher Jarratt, Vice-Chair, have joined our board of directors, bringing valuable expertise to the company.\nIn addition, the ROFO Agreement signed with AAGES became effective on March 9, 2018, formalizing our main channel for accretive growth opportunities through dropdowns. AAGES, the joint venture created to invest in the development and construction of clean energy and water infrastructure contracted assets, has already started its operations.\nTaking into account our new strategic shareholder and sponsor, our ROFO agreements and our internal and external opportunities, our target is to grow our dividend per share by 8% to 10% through 2022.\nDetails of the Results Presentation Conference\nAtlantica Yield's CEO, Santiago Seage, and its CFO, Francisco Martinez-Davis, will hold a conference call today, May 14, at 4:30 pm EST.\nIn order to access the conference call participants should dial: +1 646-828-8143 (US) or +44 (0) 330 336 9105 (UK), followed by the confirmation code 7101605 .

These factors should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect Atlantica Yield's future results included in Atlantica Yield's filings with the U.S. Commission at www.sec.gov .\nAtlantica Yield undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise.\nNon - GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS as issued by the IASB. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS as issued by the IASB and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the year or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities.\nWe define Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates as profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the Company, after adding back loss/(profit) attributable to non-controlling interest from continued operations, income tax, share of profit/(loss) of associates carried under the equity method, finance expense net, depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, and dividends received from the preferred equity investment in ACBH.\nOur management believes Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. This measure is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates is also used by management as a measure of liquidity.\nOur management uses Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with our Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.\nWe define Cash Available For Distribution as cash distributions received by the Company from its subsidiaries minus all cash expenses of the Company, including debt service and general and administrative expenses. Management believes cash available for distribution is a relevant supplemental measure of the Company's ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors.\nWe believe cash available for distribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions. In addition, cash available for distribution is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFor the three-month period ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Revenue $ 225,265 $ 198,146 Other operating income 28,414 14,992 Raw materials and consumables used (4,420) (1,076) Employee benefit expenses (5,097) (4,080) Depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges (74,624) (76,876) Other operating expenses (66,194) (54,415) Operating profit $ 103,344 $ 76,691 Financial income 296 320 Financial expense (100,067) (101,039) Net exchange differences (180) 141 Other financial income/(expense), net (1,660) 4,278 Financial expense, net $ (101,611) $ (96,300) Share of profit/(loss) of associates carried under the equity method 1,407 702 Profit/(loss) before income tax $ 3,140 $ (18,907) Income tax (4,650) 4,500 Profit/(loss) for the period $ (1,510) $ (14,407) Loss/(profit) attributable to non-controlling interests (3,254) 2,638 Profit((loss) for the period attributable to the Company $ (4,764) $ (11,769) Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (thousands) 100,217 100,217 Basic earnings per share attributable to Atlantica Yield plc (U.S. dollar per share) $ (0.05) $ (0.12) Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nAssets As of March 31,\n2018 As of December 31, 2017 Non-current assets Contracted concessional assets $ 9,100,548 $ 9,084,270 Investments carried under the equity method 57,648 55,784 Financial investments 47,198 45,242 Deferred tax assets 173,371 165,136 Total non-current assets $ 9,378,765 $ 9,350,432 Current assets Inventories 17,912 17,933 Clients and other receivables 248,410 244,449 Financial investments 209,209 210,138 Cash and cash equivalents 755,902 669,387 Total current assets $ 1,231,433 $ 1,141,907 Total assets $ 10,610,198 $ 10,492,339\nEquity and liabilities Share capital $ 10,022 10,022 Parent company reserves 2,132,161 2,163,229 Other reserves 96,141 80,968 Accumulated currency translation differences 9,521 (18,147) Retained Earnings (493,790) (477,214) Non-controlling interest 141,081 136,595 Total equity $ 1,895,136 1,895,453 Non-current liabilities Long-term corporate debt $ 583,559 574,176 Long-term project debt 5,230,432 5,228,917 Grants and other liabilities 1,676,199 1,636,060 Related parties 144,994 141,031 Derivative liabilities 320,366 329,731 Deferred tax liabilities 201,274 186,583 Total non-current liabilities $ 8,156,824 8,096,498 Current liabilities Short-term corporate debt 73,762 68,907 Short-term project debt 303,328 246,291 Trade payables and other current liabilities 154,181 155,144 Income and other tax payables 26,967 30,046 Total current liabilities $ 558,238 500,388 Total equity and liabilities $ 10,610,198 10,492,339 Consolidated Cash Flow Statements\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThree-month period ended March 31, 2018 2017 Profit/(loss) for the period (1,510) (14,407) Financial expense and non-monetary adjustments 170,459 156,090 Profit for the period adjusted by financial expense and non-monetary adjustments $ 168,949 $ 141,683 Variations in working capital (11,654) (28,701) Net interest and income tax paid (26,760) (26,610) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 130,535 $ 86,372 Investment in contracted concessional assets [9] 60,512 (1,819) Other non-current assets/liabilities (5,118) (13,363) Acquisitions of subsidiaries (9,327) -
