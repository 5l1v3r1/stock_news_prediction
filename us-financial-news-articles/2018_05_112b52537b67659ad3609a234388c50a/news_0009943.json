They argue it is crucial to forestalling a destabilizing Middle East arms race and that Iran has been abiding by its terms, a position also taken by U.S. intelligence assessments and the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency.\nZarif said: \"Let me make it absolutely clear and once and for all: we will neither outsource our security nor will we renegotiate or add onto a deal we have already implemented in good faith.\"\nReferring to Trump's past as a property magnate, Zarif added, \"To put it in real estate terms, when you buy a house and move your family in, or demolish it to build a skyscraper, you cannot come back two years later and renegotiate the price.\"\nDefying Western demands, Iran has repeatedly said it has no intention of reducing its imprint in Middle East affairs and its missile capabilities, which it has said are defensive in nature and have nothing to with nuclear activity covered by the deal.\n\"It now appears that ... some Europeans have been offering more concessions from our pocket,\" Zarif said. \"This appeasement (of Trump) entails a new deal that would include matters we all decided to exclude at the outset of our negotiations.\"\nZarif, speaking in English in the YouTube video, said the United States had \"consistently violated the nuclear deal, particularly by bullying others to prevent businesses from returning to Iran.\"\nMajor European banks and businesses continue to shun the Islamic Republic for fear of falling foul of remaining U.S. sanctions, hampering Iran's efforts to rebuild foreign trade and lure much-needed foreign investment to its economy.\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T22:26:13.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
