Dr. Sant Chawla, Principal Investigator and Director of the Sarcoma Oncology Center in Santa Monica, California, will be the presenter. CytRx out-licensed global development, manufacturing, and commercialization rights for aldoxorubicin to NantCell, Inc. in July 2017.\nPresented Statistically Significant Breakthrough LADR™ Candidate Data at the AACR 2018 Annual Meeting. In April 2018, CytRx presented three posters highlighting breakthrough data relating to its LADR™ drug candidates at the AACR 2018 Annual Meeting in Chicago. The posters describe the positive scientific findings that led to the Company's decision to select auristatin E (AE) derivatives LADR-7 and LADR-8, and maytansine derivatives LADR-9 and LADR-10, as the LADR™ candidates eligible to advance toward IND-enabling studies. The compounds demonstrated excellent, long-term antitumor activity across a wide range of human solid tumor cancer types, including lung, breast, ovarian, head and neck, renal cell, and melanoma. PDF copies of the presented posters (abstracts #1657, #2661, and #3703) can be accessed here .\nSelected Four LADR™ Candidates Eligible for IND-Enabling Clinical Studies. In March 2018, CytRx announced that four LADR™ candidates are eligible for advancement into IND-enabling studies. These candidates, named LADR-7, LADR-8, LADR-9 and LADR-10 were chosen from two distinct classes of highly cytotoxic drugs, auristatins and maytansinoids.\nPatterson Derivative Action is Dismissed. In March 2018, the Vice-Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that CytRx's motion to dismiss was granted, with prejudice. Patterson v. Kriegsman et al., C.A.

In January 2018, CytRx announced that aldoxorubicin licensee NantCell, Inc. (a private subsidiary of NantWorks, LLC) dosed the first patient in the Phase 1b portion of a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial will investigate high-affinity natural killer (haNK) cell therapy in combination with several anti-cancer agents, including aldoxorubicin, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer whose cancer has progressed on or following standard-of-care chemotherapy. This trial is a single-center, open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the various combination therapies with enrollment expected to be approximately 173 patients. The primary endpoint for the Phase 1b portion of the trial is safety and the primary endpoint for the Phase 2 portion of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST.\nPartner NantCell Dosed First Patient in Clinical Trial Evaluating Aldoxorubicin in Combination with Immuno-Oncology Agents and Cell-Based Therapies in Patients with Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma. In February 2018, CytRx announced that NantCell dosed the first patient in the Phase 1b portion of a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of either the head and neck or non-small cell lung cancer, the second trial conducted by NantCell to investigate haNK cell therapy in combination with several anti-cancer agents, including aldoxorubicin, in certain high unmet need cancer indications. This single-center, open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the various combination therapies, including combinations with aldoxorubicin, in subjects with SCC who have progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. Approximately 65 patients are expected to be enrolled. The primary endpoint for the Phase 1b portion of the trial is safety and the primary endpoint for the Phase 2 portion of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCytRx reported cash and cash equivalents of $35.1 million as of March 31, 2018.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $4.1 million, or $(0.15) per share, compared with a net loss of $11.0 million, or $(0.60) per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a reduction of $6.9 million.
