Crushers process it into vegetable oil for foods such as salad dressings and margarine, and into meal to feed cattle.\nCP railroad workers, whose collective agreement expired late last year, were asking for more predictable schedules to combat crew fatigue, among other demands. The company, which employs 12,500 workers, is a leading shipper of grain, crude oil and frac sand in North America.\nEarlier on Wednesday, industry bodies representing the mining, aluminum and fertilizer industries had urged the government to intervene in the issue.\n“Large railroads are necessary building blocks of a country’s economy and it is worse right now because the other railroad operator, Canadian National, has had very tight capacity,” Loop Capital analyst Rick Paterson said.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that his government supports the right to strike and would not intervene, as his predecessor had, “early and often” in labor disputes.\n“We believe in working things out at the bargaining table... and we’ll use all sorts of levers to enforce that,” Trudeau told Bloomberg.\nLabor Minister Patty Hajdu’s office also said that the Liberal government believes in “the collective bargaining process.”\nCP reached an agreement with unions in April to postpone a strike, which would have been the third in six years at the railroad.
