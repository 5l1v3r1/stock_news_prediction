First Quarter 2018 Operational Performance\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Ascendant produced record contained zinc equivalent metal production of 21.4 million lbs, compared to 19.6 million zinc equivalent lbs in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 13.7 million zinc equivalent lbs in the first quarter of 2017. Zinc equivalent lbs for the quarter comprised of 15.3 million lbs of zinc, 5.1 million lbs of lead and 215,599 ounces of silver.\nZinc equivalent grade for the first quarter increased to 6.1% using average spot metal pricing for the period. Zinc grades showed a significant improvement through the quarter increasing by 14% from 3.7% zinc in the fourth quarter 2017 to 4.2% zinc in the first quarter 2018. Lead and silver grades similarly showed an increase of 14% and 30% respectively to 1.6% lead and 46 g/t silver from the fourth quarter of 2017. This was the result of increased control of dilution and a firm focus on mining less sub-grade material, as well as the accelerated mining from the higher-grade Esperanza orebody that occurred as the development of the first long hole stope was completed. The success at Esperanza was partially offset by higher than expected internal dilution experienced in the Nueva Este 23L long hole stope, which has now been addressed. Recoveries for the quarter averaged 89.3% for zinc, 76.7% for lead and 78.3% for silver.\nMilled production for the quarter was 186,955 tonnes, representing a slight decrease of 6% over the fourth quarter 2017 and a 43% increase over the first quarter 2017. While the mill did encounter a number of small stoppages due to wet ore and large rocks impacting the vibrating screen and cone crusher, overall, throughput rates continue to trend higher as additional new equipment continues to be introduced and new lower cost, long hole stopes contribute a greater percentage of production. The remainder of the new mobile equipment is expected to arrive by mid-2018, completing the full underground fleet replacement program that commenced in the second quarter 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Performance\nThe Company reports financial results with 21.5 million zinc equivalent lbs sold in the first quarter 2018 with income from mining operations of $8.41 million. Average realized metal prices, on a provisional basis, for the quarter were $1.53 per pound of zinc, $1.07 per pound of lead and $16.41 per ounce of silver.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nNet concentrate sales revenue of $28.04 million Net income of $5.29 million and earnings per share of $0.07 Adjusted EBITDA 2 of $7.95 million Direct operating cost of $72.33/t and Cash Operating Costs of $0.82/ZnEq lb Operating cash flow before changes in working capital of $6.77 million Contained metal production of 21.4 ZnEq lbs, and quarterly milled tonnes of 186,955 Quarterly payable zinc equivalent production increased 9% to 18.2 million lbs from Q4 2017 with payable zinc, lead and silver production of 13.0 million lbs, 4.9 million lbs and 150,919 ozs produced respectively\nThe Company reported net income of $5.29 million or $0.07 earnings per share in the first quarter 2018. This quarter marks the first with material net income which was a result of the company achieving its targeted sales schedule of one zinc concentrate shipment per month and one lead concentrate shipment per quarter. The Company expects to maintain this schedule throughout the remainder of 2018.\nThe Company reported $5.30 million in free cash flow for the first quarter 2018 and also reported adjusted EBITDA totalling $7.95 million, representing three consecutive quarters of positive adjusted EBITDA. This is a significant increase over fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $2.28 million and first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of negative $1.69 million.\nDirect operating costs per tonne milled for the first quarter 2018 were $72.33, a 10% decrease versus fourth quarter 2017 direct operating costs per tonne milled of $80.13 and a 27% decrease versus first quarter 2017 direct operating costs per tonne milled of $98.91. These reductions are a result of cost optimization, operational efficiencies, and increased production. Cost reduction is an ongoing focus for the Company and there are currently a number of initiatives being evaluated, aimed at further improving the Company’s long-term cost structure.\nCash operating cost per zinc equivalent payable pound sold was $0.82 and All-In Sustaining Cost (“AISC”) was $1.34 per zinc equivalent payable pound sold for the first quarter. Capital expenditures were higher than anticipated in the quarter as El Mochito continued to receive additional new mining equipment and greater expenditure was required for the ongoing construction of the tailing dam lift during the dry season and the higher progress of underground development work that was achieved. With the Company now in a steady state of production, entering its first full year of normalized operations, it has adopted the AISC reporting metric as the Company believes it more fully defines the total costs associated with producing zinc and provides greater transparency for stakeholders when assessing operating performance and ability to generate free cash flow from operations.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-IFRS measure and is calculated by considering the Company's earnings before interest payments, tax, depreciation and amortization, share-based payments, adjusted for net foreign exchange expenses.\nResource Update\nOn April 10, 2018, the Company announced the results of an updated Mineral Resource & Reserve Estimate for its El Mochito mine in Honduras prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) Standards.\nThe updated Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimate marks the first compiled since Ascendant acquired the El Mochito mine in December 2016 and replaces the previous estimate with the effective date of December 31, 2015, prepared by Micon as part of the acquisition transaction.\nThe new estimate shows a material increase in both Mineral Resources and Reserves against the previous Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates dated December 31, 2015, underscoring the mine’s long history of expanding and upgrading Mineral Resources.\nHighlights include the following:\nProven & Probable Mineral Reserves increase life of mine beyond seven years (at a rate of 820kt/yr):\nContained zinc increased 193% from 204Mlbs to 597Mlbs\nContained lead increased 109% from 100Mlbs to 209Mlbs\nContained silver increased 106% from 3.5Moz to 7.2Moz\nMeasured & Indicated Mineral Resources increase\n50% to 869Mlbs contained zinc from 578Mlbs, and\n28% to 1,216Mlbs contained zinc equivalent metal, up from 953Mlbs\nInferred Mineral Resources also increase by 14% to 739Mlbs contained zinc equivalent metal, up from 648Mlbs.\nA summary of the Mineral Reserve Estimate is set out in Table 1 and the Mineral Resource Estimate can be found in Table 2 below:\nTable 1: El Mochito Mineral Reserve Statement - Effective 01 January 2018 Category Tonnes Grade Contained Metal Zn Pb Ag ZnEq.

Processing recoveries used were 88.9% Zn, 74.3% Pb, and 77.7% Ag (3) A cut-off of 4.76% ZnEq was used to estimate Mineral Reserves which includes factors for metal recovery, operating & sustaining costs, royalties, concentrate treatment charges, payables, penalties and transportation/selling costs. Average modifying factors for Mineral Reserves included internal dilution 1.2%, external dilution 14.3% and mining recovery 90.8%.

(2) Price assumptions used were US$1.21/lb Zn, US$1.06/lb Pb and US$18/troy oz Ag. Zinc equivalent metal grade (ZnEq. %) was calculated as follows: Zn% +(Pb % x 0.82) +(Ag g/t x 0.0149) = ZnEq% and is based on 88.9% Zn recovery, 74.3% Pb recovery and 77.7% Ag recovery. (3) A cut-off of 3.1% ZnEq. was used to estimate Mineral Resources and is based on fourth quarter 2017 marginal direct operating costs. (4) Results of an interpolated bulk density deposit model have been applied, and contributing 5ft downhole assay composites were capped at 38% Zn, 36% Pb and 2000g/t Ag. (5) Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. (6) The Inferred Mineral Resource in this estimate has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration. The new Technical Report is being prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) and the CIM Standards by Mercator Geological Services Limited, with contributions made by P&E Mining Consultants Inc. with reference to the Mineral Reserve Estimate, mining and metallurgical engineering sections. This Technical Report will be filed on www.sedar.com on or before the 25th May 2018.\nMineral Reserve Estimate\nThe P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Mineral Reserve Estimate (Table 1) review strategy was based on a review and check for reasonableness of the percent zinc equivalent (“ZnEq%”) cut-off value. Subsequently, the internal dilution, external dilution, and mine extraction (mining recovery) was scrutinized for each of the four mining methods employed to ensure they fell within acceptable limits for Mineral Reserve Estimate reporting. In addition, the remaining Mineral Resource Estimate not converted to a Mineral Reserve Estimate was reviewed to ensure it balanced with the mine extraction data. The Mineral Reserve Estimate reviews were summarized into overall dilution and mine extraction percentile for a reasonable value comparison analysis. The average values are as follows: Internal Dilution = 1.2%, External Dilution = 14.3% and Mine Extraction = 90.8%.\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe Mineral Resource Estimate, as set out in Table 2, was prepared by Mercator Geological Services Limited. The effective date of this Mineral Resource Estimate is January 1, 2018, and it is based on 26 contiguous areas of “manto” and/or “chimney” style skarn mineralization defined by 2,176 diamond drill holes up to December 31st, 2017. 3D solid models of skarn mineralization reflecting a minimum grade of 3% ZnEq. were depleted for previously mined areas to constrain resource volumes. GEOVIA Surpac® 6.8.1 software was used to assign block grades for zinc (%), lead (%), silver (g/t) and density (g/cm3) for Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources using inverse distance squared (ID2) interpolation methodology and capped 5 foot down hole assay composites. Up to four interpolation passes were applied using progressively increasing ellipsoid ranges to cover the range of 3D solid model sizes present. Block size is 10 feet (x) by 10 feet (y) by 10 feet (z) with two levels of sub-blocking allowed to a minimum block size of 2.5 feet (x) by 2.5 feet (y) by 2.5 feet (z). Resource categorization was applied using discrete solid models developed from contributing drill hole and assay composite parameters.\nExploration Activities\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company commenced its planned 40,000-meter 2018 drill program. This program is focused equally on definition drilling for the purpose of resource conversion to further enhance the new resource base supporting a long operating life and exploration drilling to define additional material near mine and regional exploration targets.\n2018 exploration initiatives will include a soil geochem survey of the entire El Mochito concession, the review and prioritization of near-mine targets (Manzanal, Big Fuzzy, Porvenir, Caliche) as well as other concessions within Honduras. Specifically, at El Mochito, follow up work on known “chimney” type ore bodies with historic grades in excess of 17% zinc equivalent is underway. With an abundance of historical data available, the Company will also seek to review historical, previously mined areas in the upper levels of the mine which still contain a number of high-grade targets.\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held tomorrow, May 10, 2018, at 10:00am EDT to discuss first quarter 2018 operational and financial results.\nConference Call Details:\nDate of Call: Thursday, May 10, 2018\nTime of Call: 10:00am EDT\nConference ID: 9029578\nDial-In Numbers:\nNorth American Toll-Free: 1-833-696-8362\nInternational: 1-612-979-9908\nA recorded playback of the conference call will be available until June 10, 2018 and can be accessed on the Company’s website at www.ascendantresources.com within the Investors section.\nThe information provided within this release should be read in conjunction with Ascendant’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis , which are available on Ascendant’s website and on SEDAR.

In accordance with NI-43-101, the terms “mineral reserves”, “proven mineral reserve”, “probable mineral reserve”, “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014. While the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are recognized and required by NI 43-101, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) does not recognize them. The reader is cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be economically or legally mined. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of any inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally mined, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a measured or indicated mineral resource will ever be upgraded into mineral reserves.\nReaders should be aware that the Company’s financial statements (and information derived therefrom) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and are subject to Canadian auditing and auditor independence standards.

Ascendant does not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information after the date of this news release or to explain any material difference between subsequent actual events and any forward-looking information, except as required by applicable law.\nNon-IFRS Performance Measures\nThe non-IFRS performance measures presented do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nNon-IFRS reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that represents an indication of the Company’s continuing capacity to generate earnings from operations before taking into account management’s financing decisions and costs of consuming capital assets, and management’s estimate of their useful life. EBITDA comprises revenue less operating expenses before interest expense (income), property, plant and equipment amortization and depletion, and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA has been included in this document. Under IFRS, entities must reflect in compensation expense the cost of share-based payments. In the Company’s circumstances, share-based payments involve a significant accrual of amounts that will not be settled in cash but are settled by the issuance of shares in exchange for cash. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently. As such, the Company has made an entity specific adjustment to EBITDA for these expenses. The Company has also made an entity-specific adjustment to the foreign currency exchange (gain)/loss.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nQ1 Q4 Q1 Adjusted EBITDA March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net income (loss) $000's 5,294 (1,429 ) (2,894 ) $000's Adjusted for: $000's Depletion and depreciation $000's 884 1,298 654 Interest income/expense $000's 37 53 50 Accretion expense on rehabilitation liabilities $000's 207 (250 ) 178 Financing charge on termination obligations $000's 421 803 65 Share-based payments $000's 352 368 - Foreign currency exchange gain/loss $000's (96 ) 279 257 Income taxes $000's 846 1,158 - Adjusted EBITDA $000's 7,945 2,280 (1,690 ) Direct operating cost per tonne milled\nThe Company uses the non-IFRS measure of direct operating cost per tonne milled to manage and evaluate operating performance. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flows. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Company considers cost of sales per tonne milled to be the most comparable IFRS measure to direct operating cost per tonne milled and has included calculations of this metric in the reconciliations within the applicable tables to follow.\nDirect operating cost per tonne milled includes mine direct operating production costs such as mining, processing, administration, indirect charges such as surface maintenance and camp expenses, and inventory sales adjustments but does not include, smelting, refining and freight costs, royalties, depreciation, depletion, amortization, reclamation, and capital costs.\nCash operating costs\nCash operating costs is a financial performance measure with no standard meaning under IFRS. Ascendant reports total production cash costs on a sales basis. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, such as sales, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate operating earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. Management uses this metric as an important tool to monitor operating cost performance.\nTotal production cash costs include production costs, such as mining, processing charges divided by ZnEq payable pounds sold to arrive at total cash operating costs per ZnEq payable pound sold. The measure also includes other mine related costs incurred such as variation in inventory. Production costs are exclusive of depreciation. Other companies may calculate this measure differently.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of direct operating costs and all-in sustaining costs to cost of sales, as reported in the Company’s consolidated statement of income (loss) and 2017:\nQ1 Q4 Q1 Direct operating cost per tonne milled March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Production expenses (from consolidated income statement) $000's 19,624 20,336 9,707 Add: Termination Liability Payments $000's 228 14 563 Deduct (Add): Variation in Finished Inventory $000's (4,178 ) (2,158 ) 3,733 Deduct: Depreciation in production $000's (878 ) (1,290 ) (653 ) Total cash costs (including royalties) $000's 14,796 16,902 13,350 Deduct: Government taxes and royalties $000's (1,274 ) (1,009 ) (381 ) Direct operating costs $000's 13,522 15,893 12,969 Tonnes Milled tonnes 186,955 198,354 131,116 Direct operating cost per tonne milled $/tonne $ 72.33 $ 80.13 $ 98.91 Q1 Q4 Q1 AISC per ZnEq payable pound sold March 31, 2018 2017 2017 ZnEq payable pounds sold 000's lbs 21,543 17,599 7,748 Cash Operating Costs Reconciliation Direct operating costs $000's 13,522 15,893 12,969 Add (deduct): Variation in Finished Inventory $000's 4,178 2,158 (3,733 ) Cash operating costs 17,700 18,051 9,236 Cash operating cost per ZnEq payable pound sold $/ZnEq lb $ 0.82 $ 1.03 $ 1.19 All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) Reconciliation Total cash operating costs $000's 17,700 18,051 9,236 Add: Government taxes and royalties $000's 1,274 1,009 381 Add: TC & RCs $000's 3,720 3,629 1,484 Add: G&A, excluding depreciation and amortization $000's 1,718 2,727 567 Add: Accretion expense on rehabilitation liabilities $000's 207 (250 ) 178 Add: Sustaining capital expenditure $000's 4,185 1,994 1,027 Total All-in sustaining costs $000's 28,804 27,160 12,873 AISC per ZnEq payable pound sold $/ZnEq lb $ 1.34 $ 1.54 $ 1.66 Additional non-IFRS measures\nThe Company uses other financial measures, the presentation of which is not meant to be a substitute for other subtotals or totals presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measures. The following other financial measures are used:\nOperating cash flows before movements in working capital - excludes the movement from period-to-period in working capital items including trade and other receivables, prepaid expenses, deposits, inventories, trade and other payables and the effects of foreign exchange rates on these items.\nThe terms described above do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and therefore the Company’s definitions are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company’s management believes that their presentation provides useful information to investors because cash flows generated from operations before changes in working capital excludes the movement in working capital items. This, in management’s view, provides useful information of the Company’s cash flows from operations and are considered to be meaningful in evaluating the Company’s past financial performance or its future prospects. The most comparable IFRS measure is cash flows from operating activities.\nSource:Ascendant Resources Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1CSzTY8ievniNoIJvN-yk2H8fnKaxzlif-FmMt8_-rY05OkwV1dZanrI7dn2JGfo75Ew_u_LSTxMYKKaLwmo9sOT_XqjcNAcOE8EZYXEt3ia12g6Qmw4X2AjJnz85_Lp", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/903b04a1-98bf-4127-95c4-4ed11094687d", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=siyBzkxmYvM2d4Q2wPXWk9uLsg5WKsla6Gda3X2VCf_u5AkKmIwPIHs2S7Qop9cjek_HWBuT122CvZCIgzRcrQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=siyBzkxmYvM2d4Q2wPXWk0PZGkepXadDGSJxrd7emJWrmOowrUo2hN428fGhnxFUgG3QHINGwkgSLHAg7DZyng==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PVc2HdFUJOrT1CoTpw5vy3lggyxnU5dOYiyGeXVJeFTtoQrF5UQoKUVDnPI-EC5u5iiyPZN3eorGj-P4mIV6Uh-bkHd1UgUoNmTJB-5wBiRHuSI_2Puc0tMBQLkVQPky", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1CSzTY8ievniNoIJvN-yk2H8fnKaxzlif-FmMt8_-rbuBcelU1JcIexIYCnNNA2A_Vy0U8oRK2Op7x69_I6LGXh47RA-568xSxrWMqGjXrDTGG1oTuMEIA7TdDfjSGYPWsLBPAoPahDC8ghHDMMK_ZndeZXtb8Nd0V0KRAsp-qPg0PSrmSFMfQtrGGSSBhB3bVsBqRQCEKBPUfZnR2yX8ZSnQ2Zp7D8jpgVZloBpUheBtCH8VujVL_tOR5F2Qi2xCnfYs-cawkZmM41CyjFuT2vCTM_rJM5d4M_39GaI17E="], "published": "2018-05-10T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T04:12:50.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
