Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, on Friday urged the FCC to investigate, saying on Twitter a “hacker could have used this site to know when you were in your house so they would know when to rob it. A predator could have tracked your child’s cell phone to know when they were alone.” (Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:20:36.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
