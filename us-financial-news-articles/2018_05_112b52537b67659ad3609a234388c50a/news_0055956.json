Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up 0.6% at $75.76 a barrel after falling Monday.\nBoth U.S. and Brent crude prices tumbled on Friday as Saudi Arabia and Russia neared a deal to increase oil production after more than a year of holding back output. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries—of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto-head—and 10 producers outside the oil cartel, including Russia, have been curbing crude production since the start of last year.\nThe coordinated cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2018, helped to mop up a supply glut that had weighed on prices since late 2014. They had pushed oil prices to their highest level since November 2014 last week before recent declines.\n“I think you’re going to get all this lead up to the OPEC meeting….The market is pricing in that they are going to remove this production cap,” said Bill Baruch, president of futures and commodities brokerage firm Blue Line Futures.\nStill, Mr. Baruch said any developments now suggesting less production than expected could boost prices. He noted that U.S. crude had already risen from its Tuesday low of $65.80 during the session.\nOPEC and its allies are set to meet in Vienna on June 22.\nOil prices have also gotten a boost recently from a strengthening geopolitical risk premium out of Iran and Venezuela. U.S. economic sanctions on both of those OPEC members are expected to hinder their oil industries and reduce global supply.\nRelated Reading\nU.S. Sanctions Start to Pinch Shipping in Iran China and Russia Push Into Iran, Exploiting Europe’s Caution Russia, Saudi Arabia Near Deal to Lift Output, Giving Moscow New Sway Trump’s Iran Sanctions to Shake Up Global Oil Supply Lines A crude oil tanker in the Persian Gulf.

Photo: Ali Mohammadi/Bloomberg News Risks to Venezuelan and Iranian supply come amid an increasingly tight oil market, with commercial petroleum inventories at their lowest levels since 2014. The combination of these factors, coupled with concerns about oil prices rising too high, prompted OPEC and Russia to reconsider raising output, analysts say.\n“We expect more oil from OPEC+ but still expect inventories to move lower both this year and next year,” according to Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets.\nOil market participants were looking ahead to weekly data on U.S. stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, scheduled to be released Wednesday.\nAmong refined products Tuesday, gasoline futures fell 1% to $2.1603 a gallon. Diesel futures declined 0.7% to $2.1920 a gallon.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-12279?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12279?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12279?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12279?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12279?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-12279?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-05-29T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:35:18.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
