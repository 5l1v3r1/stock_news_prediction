REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo The suspension comes amid a broad crackdown on pollution in China and stricter regulation around waste imports. It poses a serious headache for China’s scrap buyers: the United States is a major source of scrap metal for China and top supplier of scrap copper.\nIn a notice to customers dated May 3, reviewed by Reuters, China Certification and Inspection Group (CCIC) North America said it would stop processing applications and issuing certificates for scrap material shipments from May 4 to June 4.\nThe company could not immediately be reached for comment outside normal working hours in the United States.\nThe inspection firm said in the notice it would empty every container of U.S.-origin scrap from May 4 to check for plastic and other hazardous waste products, which it would send for further testing.\nDuring the month-long period, CCIC North America “will temporarily stop processing applications and issuing the certificate for pre-shipment inspection on scrap materials to China,” it said.\nLast year, China imported a total of 5.74 million tonnes of scrap metal, mainly scrap copper and aluminium, according to official data. But imports have fallen sharply year on year so far in 2018 as quotas have been progressively tightened.\nChina imported 50,000 tonnes of copper scrap from the U.S. in March and more than 500,000 tonnes last year, equivalent to 15 percent of the country’s secondary supply.\nReporting by Tom Daly in BEIJING and Melanie Burton in MELBOURNE Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T10:36:19.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
