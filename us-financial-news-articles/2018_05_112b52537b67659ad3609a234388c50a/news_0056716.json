The group received informal interest from infrastructure funds keen to own a stake in its core fixed-line network, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nRoyal Mail shares sustained the heaviest losses, down 2.8 percent as broker Berenberg downgraded the stock to “sell” on increasing growth and profit risks.\nIt also noted that complying with new EU regulations to protect privacy may weigh on marketing activities.\nAstraZeneca rose 0.9 percent after its immunotherapy drug Imfinzi hit a second important goal by improving overall survival in lung cancer patients, boosting prospects for a medicine that has already got off to a promising commercial launch.\nAmong smaller companies, Gold miner Centamin dropped about 18 percent after it made a drastic cut to its full-year production guidance while Capita jumped 7.7 percent after it raised 681.4 million pounds through a rights issue.\nEnvironmental infrastructure company Pennon Group added 7.6 percent after reporting its full-year profits. Gambling company GVC Holdings was up 4.3 percent after it raised its forecast of cost savings from its 4 billion pound acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral.
