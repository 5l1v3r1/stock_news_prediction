The company is preparing for a $2 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong. A company spokesman did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nGEM, which is based in Shenzhen, also makes battery materials and has a cobalt brand deliverable against the London Metal Exchange’s cobalt contract. The company did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nReporting by Tom Daly, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T11:28:18.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
