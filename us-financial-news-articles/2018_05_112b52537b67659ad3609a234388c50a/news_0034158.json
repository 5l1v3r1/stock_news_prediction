Maestros of their craft, the Cerruti's reputation grew throughout the century, with the 20 year old Nino Cerruti taking up the baton in the 1950s. In 1967, he founded Cerruti 1881, creating a legendary impact on men's ready to wear. Today, the brand has almost 100 directly-operated stores globally and is stocked at leading retailers worldwide.\nCerruti has a long-standing expertise in the global Fragrance industry. The first Cerruti fragrance was launched in 1978 and since then the brand has had many successful fragrances for both men and women, particularly the 1881 range.\nSince April 2011, Cerruti 1881 is part of the Hong Kong based Trinity Limited group, specialized in high-end men's prêt à porter. Jason Basmajian was appointed Chief Creative Officer in October 2015. His vision of the Cerruti Man is sophisticated, a man of the times who appreciates style over trends. In 2017, Cerruti celebrated the 50 years of the brand.\nAbout Designer Parfums\nDesigner Parfums has a strong assortment of premium fragrances and beauty products which are either wholly owned or operated under license.
