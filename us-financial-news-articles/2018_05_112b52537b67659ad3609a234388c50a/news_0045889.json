Vaccinations could begin by next Monday.\nThere are no direct flights between DRC and the United States.\nSkinner said the CDC was monitoring the situation and planned to post notices to travelers in airports on the way to DRC and traveling back to the United States on any flights that originated in the DRC.\nInbound travelers would be reminded to avoid contact with other people’s blood or body fluids and to seek treatment immediately if they develop symptoms of Ebola, which include fever, headache, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, rash or red eyes during or after travel.\nThe CDC’s actions so far are part of the standard response during such outbreaks, Skinner said.\nReporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T00:32:14.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
