(\"STARTEK\") (NYSE:SRT), a provider of business process outsourcing services, has reported its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nManagement Commentary\n“The first quarter was arguably the most strategically significant quarter in the Company’s history,” said Chad Carlson, CEO of STARTEK. “In January, we entered into a multi-year strategic alignment with one of the most innovative and customer-focused companies in the world.\n“And in March, we announced a strategic transaction with an affiliate of Capital Square Partners (CSP) involving their portfolio company, ESM Holdings Limited (Aegis), a leading global business service provider of customer experience management. STARTEK will issue CSP shares of its common stock representing approximately 55% of outstanding common stock of the combined company in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Aegis. Both exciting developments provide us with the opportunity to take the differentiation of the STARTEK Advantage System to new markets and clients while significantly diversifying our revenue base across a global, scaled footprint.”\n“Over the past several years, we have made great progress toward diversifying the business into new verticals and adding many new clients,” stated Mr. Carlson. “I cannot overstate the level to which these two accomplishments de-risk the company going forward and position STARTEK to deliver predictable profitable growth into the future. In fact, the market power of combining these two very entrepreneurially oriented companies has already been very evident in multiple client meetings since our announcement.\n“Following this release, we are filing our preliminary proxy statement which contains a more detailed description of the transaction and related information. We expect to be in a position to close the transaction in the third quarter. At that time, we anticipate bringing in some new members of senior management to lead the combined organization, headlined by the addition of industry veteran Lance Rosenzweig as CEO. Lance brings more than 25 years of executive experience across a range of service industries, having previously served as CEO of Aegis USA and CEO of PeopleSupport. I very much look forward to working with Lance as I assume the role of chief innovation officer. In this role, I will be focused on building upon the differentiation and solutions which Aegis and STARTEK have developed to enable customer engagement for clients. It’s an exciting time for STARTEK, and we will continue to update our shareholders as we work together with Aegis to become a formidable global provider of valuable services for our clients.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the first quarter was $69.1 million compared to $77.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in production billings related to the company’s margin improvement initiative and lower call volumes as a result of softer wireless volumes and lost programs, partially offset by new business and net growth from existing clients in the cable, retail and healthcare verticals.\nGross margin in the first quarter was 8.2% compared to 12.9% in the year-ago quarter, with the decline primarily due to the warrants issued in January, and the associated contra revenue accounting adjustment, upon the multi-year strategic alignment with one of the most innovative and customer-focused companies in the world, partially offset by higher-margin from new and existing business.\nDuring the first quarter, lower volumes and lost programs from wireless clients led to lower revenue and profitability. However, despite lower volumes from these customers, the high-grading initiatives from 2017 began to show, especially in domestic sites. Though domestic segment revenue was down $2.8 million, domestic gross margin increased 270 basis points.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $8.6 million compared to $7.9 million in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 12.4% compared to 10.2%. The increase in SG&A was predominantly due to an increase in selling expenses.\nNet loss for the first quarter was $10.0 million or $(0.62) per share, compared to net income of $1.8 million or $0.11 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted net loss* in the first quarter was $1.2 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the lower revenue and gross margin.\nAdjusted EBITDA* in the first quarter was $2.3 million compared to $5.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to the aforementioned factors impacting revenue and gross margin.\nFree cash flow* in the first quarter was $(5.6) million compared to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the company’s cash position was $1.2 million compared to $1.5 million at December 31, 2017. STARTEK closed the quarter with a $24.7 million balance on its $50 million credit facility compared to $19.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2017.\n*A non-GAAP measure defined below\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nSTARTEK will hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its first quarter 2018 results and strategic transaction.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included below. This non-GAAP information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. It is provided solely to assist in an investor’s understanding of these items on the comparability of the Company’s operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nThe Company defines non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus Income tax expense (benefit), Impairment losses and restructuring charges, net, Interest expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, Share-based compensation expense, Fees and expenses related to the transactions, and Warrant contra revenue. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business. Management believes that excluding these non-cash and other non-recurring items permits a more meaningful comparison and understanding of our strength and performance of our ongoing operations for our investors and analysts.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (10,026 ) $ 1,793 Income tax expense (benefit) 148 (28 ) Impairment losses and restructuring charges, net 4,453 — Interest expense 391 418 Depreciation and amortization expense 2,643 2,962 Share-based compensation expense 262 229 Transaction related fees 1,887 — Warrant contra revenue 2,500 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,258 $ 5,374 Free cash flow:\nThe Company defines non-GAAP free cash flow as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reduced by capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (3,618 ) $ 7,183 Less: capital expenditures (1,944 ) (1,113 ) Free cash flow $ (5,562 ) $ 6,070 Adjusted gross profit:\nThe Company defines non-GAAP Adjusted gross profit as Gross profit plus Warrant contra revenue.
