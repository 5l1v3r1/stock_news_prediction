And also for an Irishman,” a drenched Yates said. “It was a very difficult final. I think a few guys underestimated it, myself included.”\nAt one point late on, the stage seemed destined to end in a battle between Bahrain-Merida’s Matej Mohoric and Movistar rider Carlos Betancur.\nBoth carved out brief leads before being reeled in by the pack, with Bennett in the midst of the Bora-Hansgrohe team at the front of the main group, but neither of them had an answer to the Irishman’s power.\n“It was a tough final for a bunch sprint,” said Bennett, who claimed victory with a gutsy sprint from 400m.\n“There were two guys up front. I didn’t know how much energy they had left so I went early because I didn’t want to let the stage get away from me.\n“I didn’t know if I would hold the lead. It worked to my advantage ... I just had to do my sprint. I think it’s a nicer win than the first one.”\nReporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:34:54.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
