Instead, according to the wire service, they’re “another apparent effort to pressure the special counsel to hasten the end of his work.”\nGiuliani has said he doesn’t want a repeat of 2016, when then-FBI director James Comey’s announced his agency was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, during this year’s midterm elections. Similarly, many Democrats have publicly expressed they felt that announcement cost Clinton the presidency.\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Giuliani said the entire probe— not just the aspects tied to potential obstruction of justice—would wrap up in September.\nOfficials speaking with Reuters, though, say there’s no timeline and Mueller’s team will look until it’s satisfied all aspects have been examined.\n“He’ll wrap it up when he thinks he’s turned over every rock, and when that is will depend on how cooperative witnesses, persons of interest and maybe even some targets are, if any of those emerge, and on what new evidence he finds, not on some arbitrary, first-of-the-month deadline one of the president’s attorneys cooks up,” the Reuters source said.\nGiuliani’s comments come shortly after the Mueller investigation hit the one-year mark on May 17. On the eve of that anniversary, he called for an end to the inquiry, saying “They should [end] it today. As soon as possible.” Laura Ingraham: \"What is your optimal timeline for [the Mueller probe] to wrap up?\"Rudy Giuliani: \"They should do it today.\"\nTUNE IN: Watch Rudy Giuliani's exclusive interview on @IngrahamAngle on Fox News Channel tonight at 10p ET. pic.twitter.com/60xo6v8rux\n— Fox News (@FoxNews) May 16, 2018\nThat same day, he claimed the Mueller team can’t indict a sitting president , as there was no precedent.
