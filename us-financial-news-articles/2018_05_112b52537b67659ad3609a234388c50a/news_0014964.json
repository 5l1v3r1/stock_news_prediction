Many organizations continue to struggle to fully understand their supply chains, with 53% saying they don’t have enough information about their fourth- and fifth-party partners, a survey found.\nA Deloitte survey on extended enterprise risk management, or EERM, found one in five respondents among 975 senior leaders in 15 countries said their organizations don’t identify, review or monitor fourth or fifth parties. Deloitte sponsors the WSJ Risk & Compliance Journal. Just 2% said they regularly monitor subcontractors at the fourth or fifth levels of their chain, while 10% do so for subcontractors they classify as critical. The rest rely on their third-party partners to provide oversight.\n“Third parties are closer to the core of businesses than ever before,” said Chuck Saia, chief executive of Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory, in a statement. “Organizations that step up to the challenge of developing programs to better manage third-party risk can elevate their position in the market by unleashing with confidence the reach, expertise and relationships that third parties can bring.”\nMore organizations looking to improve risk awareness and make their EERM programs more efficient are turning to centralized management structures. The survey found 52% described their EERM management as highly centralized, or more centralized than decentralized.\nNearly half the respondents (48%) cited the desire to reduce costs as a main reason for investing in EERM. Twenty-six percent cited greater flexibility to navigate market uncertainty and 21% looked at EERM spending as a way to boost revenue. Forty-nine percent said they were somewhat confident they would gain tangible results from EERM investments.\n“The business case for investment in EERM is increasingly being focused on exploiting the upside of risk—a significant shift from the almost-exclusive focus earlier on managing the downside, with increasing confidence to demonstrate tangible benefits from such investment,” Deloitte said.\nCOMPLIANCE\nEU is set to settle Gazprom antitrust case.
