The U.S. has threatened to slap tariffs on steel, aluminum and a slew of other products if it doesn't get what it wants from China and other global partners.\nChina, though, remains the key.\n\"Before landing in China we sent them an extremely detailed list of our needs, and they responded with a similarly detailed but as you can imagine quite different list of their proposals,\" Ross said. \"The gap remains wide.\"\nHowever, he also expressed confidence that the U.S. holds the upper hand.\nEven if China were to put a retaliatory 25 percent tariff on the $50 billion or so of U.S. goods it imports, it would barely make a dent on the U.S. economy, Ross said. In fact, there would even be some benefit as some of the goods the U.S. gets from China would be produced domestically.\nIn a related issue, Ross discussed the recent controversy over Chinese technology company ZTE . Trump has pledged to help the company get off what Ross described as the \"bad list, so they could not receive exports of high-tech material.\"\nRoss said the question remains now over whether there are \"alternative remedies\" to deal with ZTE.\n\"That's the area we will be exploring very, very promptly,\" he said.
