(the “ Company ”) (TSXV:CLN.H), a capital pool company pursuant to Policy 2.4 of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “ TSXV ”), announces the following persons as the new officers and directors of the Company, subject to TSXV approval:\nMichael Frank (Director/CEO/CFO)\nMr. Frank is currently the Chief Strategy Officer of DataMetrex AI Limited (TSXV:DM), Chief Executive Officer of Ronin Blockchain Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of DataMetrex, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Internet of Things Inc.

Prior to Jiffy, Jaimie was the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of UpTrend Media, an online advertising representation firm, from 2003 to 2010, which was acquired by Yellow Pages in 2010.\nRobbie Grossman (Corporate Secretary)\nRobbie Grossman is a securities, M&A and corporate finance lawyer at DLA Piper (Canada) LLP. His cross border practice is underscored by deep experience in acting for emerging issuers and public companies. Prior to DLA Piper (Canada) LLP he was with McMillan LLP from September 2013 to March 2018 and at Garfinkle Biderman LLP from February 2004 to September 2013. Mr. Grossman has been, and currently is, an officer and director of several publicly traded companies.\nIn connection with the complete management change, the Company announces a proposed non-brokered private placement for gross proceeds of up to $300,000 through the issuance of up to 6,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.05 per share. All securities issued pursuant to the financing will be subject to a four-month hold period. The financing is subject to approval by the TSXV. The net proceeds will be used by the Company for working capital and the identification and evaluation of a Qualifying Transaction (as such term is defined by the TSXV). The Company anticipates that each new officer and director of the Company will subscribe for at least $5,000 of common shares, which will be subject to a TSXV Form 2F Escrow Agreement . The subscriptions by the new officers and directors will result in a \"related party transaction\" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (“MI 61-101”). The transaction is expected to be exempt from the formal valuation requirements of MI 61-101 as none of the securities of the Company are listed on a prescribed stock exchange. The proposed transaction is expected to be exempt from the minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 based on the financial hardship exemption.\nThe Company also proposes to complete two securities for debt transactions with two arm’s length service providers. Pursuant to the proposed transactions the Company would issue an aggregate of $56,500 of unsecured convertible debentures in satisfaction of $56,500 of indebtedness. The convertible debentures would be convertible into an aggregate of 941,666 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $0.06 per share concurrent with the closing of a Qualifying Transaction. The Company determined to satisfy the indebtedness with common shares in order to preserve its cash for use on working capital and the identification and evaluation of a Qualifying Transaction. The transactions are subject to the approval of the TSXV and the directors of the Company. The common shares issued in satisfaction of the indebtedness will be subject to a four month hold period from the date of issuance.\nThe Company also announces the grant of 323,370 stock options to the new officers and directors of the Company at an exercise price of $0.06 per common share expiring on May 23, 2028. Upon resignation all of the stock options held by the departing officers and directors were forfeited.\nThe Company anticipates that its stock will remain halted on the TSXV until such times as the new management team has been approved by the TSXV and the financing, specifically the subscriptions by the new management team, has closed.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this news release constitute \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation.
