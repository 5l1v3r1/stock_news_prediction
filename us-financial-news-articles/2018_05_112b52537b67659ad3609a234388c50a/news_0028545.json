Baseload power prices are broadly higher this month than a year ago too.\nBut the wholesale price constitutes less then half of retail prices. Other charges, some policy-driven to encourage a switch to renewable fuels, make up the rest.\nBritain’s dominant energy companies, which also include E.ON and SSE Plc, face price caps on the standard variable tariffs which the government plans to implement in time for winter, as well as fierce competition from smaller rivals.\nThe government has said British energy prices are a “rip-off” after it emerged household bills have doubled over the last decade, despite a series of market liberalisation reforms.
