(WFCF) (OTCQB:WFCF), the most trusted resource for independent, third-party verification of food production practices in North America, today announced it has acquired privately held software maker Sow Organic, Inc., in a transaction valued at $900,000, including $450,000 in cash and $450,000 in WFCF common stock.\nSow Organic’s software as a service (SaaS) model allows organic certification bodies to automate and accelerate new customer onboarding by converting traditional paper-based processes to digital format, resulting in lower costs, improved workflow management and increased productivity. Sow Organic’s unique design allows certification bodies to digitize any certification scheme. Likewise, the software affords producers and handlers a more efficient way to become certified and to digitally manage their records on an ongoing basis, including completing annual certification requirements fully online.\nUnder USDA regulations, any food producer that grosses more than $5,000 in organic sales annually must be certified under the National Organic Program (NOP). There are 48 organic certification bodies in the U.S. alone with more in Canada and Mexico. In addition, there are an estimated 25,000 organic producers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. At present, only a small fraction of the total number of certification bodies and producers use the product so there is substantial upside opportunity.\nWFCF’s SureHarvest subsidiary, which offers its own patented SaaS solution in the sustainability space, will oversee the integration of Sow Organic. The two companies will work together to further develop the organic business opportunity and collaborate on a broader rollout of the solution to other certification markets where the tool is equally suited to improve efficiencies and reduce costs in the certification process.\nJeff Dlott, CEO of SureHarvest, said, “We welcome Sow Organic to the team. Our companies share tremendous synergies and a common vision for using technology to improve efficiencies for our customers. We look forward to a smooth integration process and to collaborating on strategies to accelerate development of the organic market and introduce Sow’s SaaS solution to the broader verification and certification market.”\nSeth Broadfoot, CEO of Sow Organic, added, “We are excited to be joining Where Food Comes From and working with the SureHarvest team, which pioneered the SaaS concept in the sustainable crop production space. To date, we have been focused strictly on the organic market – helping certification bodies and organic growers and handlers simplify and lower the cost of their NOP certifications. By joining with WFCF and SureHarvest and becoming part of a much larger organization, we’ll now have the resources to help accelerate our penetration of the organic market and unlock the greater potential of our solutions in other certification areas.”\nAbout Where Food Comes From, Inc.\nWhere Food Comes From, Inc. is America’s trusted resource for third party verification of food production practices.
