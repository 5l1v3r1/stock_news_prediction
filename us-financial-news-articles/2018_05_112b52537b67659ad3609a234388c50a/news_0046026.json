Gold, meanwhile, sank to a low for the year so far. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.22 percent versus the greenback to 111.00 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3432, down 0.29 percent.\nThe yen was pressured by recent weaker Japanese data, expectations of falling safe-haven demand with the easing of the U.S.-China trade war, and elevated U.S. Treasury yields, analysts said.\nThe euro turned slightly positive after suffering from concerns about political uncertainty in Italy.\nItaly’s far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and to implement spending plans seen by some investors as threatening the sustainability of the country’s debt pile.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield IT10YT=RR rose to its highest level since April 2017 before easing back.\nU.S. Treasuries, which were steady ahead of $99 billion in new supply scheduled for this week, were supported by safety buying prompted by the surging Italian borrowing costs.\nMeanwhile, oil prices soared to their highest level since 2014 after Venezuela’s presidential election spurred worries that the country’s oil output could fall further. The market is also weighing the possibility of additional U.S. sanctions on Venezuela following its presidential election.\nU.S. crude CLc1 rose 1.8 percent to $72.56 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $79.52, up 1.29 percent on the day.\nCrude prices climbed further on U.S. President Donald Trump’s discussions with Russia and China about issuing new debt to Venezuela.\nExpectations that U.S. sanctions on Iran could curb the country’s crude exports have also led crude prices higher in recent weeks.
