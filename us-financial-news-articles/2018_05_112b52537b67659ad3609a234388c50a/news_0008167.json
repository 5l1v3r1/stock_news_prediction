Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDSY), a leading provider of enterprise asset management technology, reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\n“The first quarter marked a strong start to the fiscal year, highlighted by 20% sequential and 67% year-over-year growth,” said I.D. Systems CEO Chris Wolfe. “Our impressive growth was driven by solid contributions across all three of our businesses. Of particular note, our Connected Vehicle Solutions business shipped 13,000 Universal Telematics Platform (UTP) devices to Avis, demonstrating our ability to rapidly certify new vehicles and scale production. We also realized strong sales in our Industrial Truck Management business in the U.S., as well as continued large-scale roll outs of PowerFleet at several of the world’s largest automotive manufacturers.\n“Our improving financial and operational performance is the result of our innovative and expanding product portfolio. Along that line, during the first quarter we introduced a new class of industrial truck telematics platforms called ‘106’ for small to mid-sized fleets used in manufacturing, distribution, logistics and retail centers. We plan to launch this next-generation platform in the U.S. and Europe this summer, helping us to better address the vast majority of the more than 10 million industrial trucks globally. In addition, we plan to commercially release three new Logistics Visibility Solutions products, which will significantly expand our market opportunity.\n“2018 is a year of product innovation, market excitement and large-scale roll outs. To that end, we expect to ship the majority of the remaining 37,000 units ordered by Avis predominately in the second quarter with the balance in the third quarter, depending on Avis’ certification requests and vehicle deliver schedules. Overall, our operational momentum, strong balance sheet and leading technology have established a solid foundation for us to leverage in 2018 and the years ahead.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue increased 67% to $13.4 million from $8.0 million in same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to higher Connected Vehicle Solutions revenue and Industrial Truck revenue.\nGross margin decreased to 48.3% from 51.9% in the same period a year ago. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the initial deliveries of Connected Vehicle Solutions hardware, which have lower upfront margins, but which grow over time making for high lifecycle profitability over the contract term.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $5.7 million, compared to $4.7 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from Keytroller, which were absent in the same period a year ago, as well as higher marketing expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $1.7 million, compared to $1.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in research and development expense was due to investments in new product development as well as the inclusion of expenses from Keytroller, which were absent in the same period a year ago.\nExcluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency translation losses, and acquisition-related expenses, non-GAAP net loss totaled $105,000 or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share (based on 17.0 million weighted average shares outstanding), an improvement from non-GAAP net loss of $1.1 million or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share (based on 13.3 million weighted average shares outstanding) in the same year-ago quarter.\nNet loss totaled $990,000 or $(0.06) per basic and diluted share (based on 17.0 million weighted average shares outstanding), an improvement from a net loss of $1.9 million or $(0.14) per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago quarter (based on 13.3 million weighted average shares outstanding).\nAt quarter-end, the company had $14.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nInvestor Conference Call\nI.D. Systems management will discuss the results of the company’s operations and business outlook on a conference call today (Wednesday, May 2, 2018) at 4:45 p.m. Eastern time (1:45 p.m. Pacific time).\nCompany CEO Chris Wolfe and CFO Ned Mavrommatis will host the call, followed by a question and answer session where financial analysts and major institutional shareholders can ask questions.\nU.S. dial-in: (877) 307-1379\nInternational dial-in: (443) 877-4066\nConference ID: 2468678\nThe conference call will be broadcast simultaneously and available for replay in the investor section of the company’s website at www.id-systems.com .\nIf you have any difficulty connecting with the conference call, please contact I.D.

Systems provides certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income/loss and non-GAAP net income/loss per basic and diluted share. Reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of I.D. Systems’ current financial performance. Specifically, I.D. Systems believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook.

Systems’ method for calculating the non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies’ methods, the non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release to the nearest GAAP measures can be found in the financial tables included in this press release.\nAbout I.D.
