He declined to confirm media reports that the United States suspended the sale of arms to Paraguay because of concerns about controls at the borders with Brazil.\nReporting by Daniela Desantis; writing by Hugh Bronstein; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:12:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
