Adjusted pretax profit rose to 92.4 million pounds from 75.5 million pounds a year earlier.\nThe companyâ€™s total export revenue, of which a large share comes from its pork exports to China, surged 30.2 percent in the year, while its revenue from Far Eastern markets declined 6.1 percent.\nCranswick said it would increase the final dividend to 38.6 pence per share from 31.0 pence.
