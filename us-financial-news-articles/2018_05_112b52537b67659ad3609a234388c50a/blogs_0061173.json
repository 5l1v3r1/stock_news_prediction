Hospitals said they were running out of supplies.\nSchools canceled classes, businesses told employees to work from home and virtually every part of the powerhouse agribusiness sector said the damage was massive, if not yet quantifiable.\nIn a Sunday night televised address, President Michel Temer said he signed three decrees with immediate effect to address the main demands of truck drivers, adding that \"we gave everything they asked for.\"\nOne of the decrees cuts the price of diesel at the pump by 12 percent for 60 days, another ordered toll operators across the country not to charge for rear axles that are not in use, and another mandates the minimum fare for freight to be paid to truckers.\nIn a sign of the uncertainty of how or when the protest may wind down, one of the leaders of independent truckers in Rio de Janeiro, Vicente Reis, said that drivers were not happy with what Temer offered.\n\"We are not satisfied with what was offered, nor even with who was negotiating,\" Reis said. \"Our goal is no longer just a cut in diesel prices. We won the support of society and now we want a reduction in the costs of other fuels.\"\nBrazilian finance minister Eduardo Guardia said on Monday that the measures Temer announced will cost 9.5 billion reais ($2.6 billion), of which 3.8 billion will come from cutting government expenses.\n($1 = 3.6509 reais) (Reporting by Raquel Stenzel, Alberto Alerigi, Camila Moreira and Tatiana Bautzer in Sao Paulo; Marcela Ayres, Lisandra Paraguassu and Bruno Federowski in Brasilia; and Rodrigo Viga Gaier in Rio de Janeiro Writing by Brad Brooks Editing by James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:36:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
