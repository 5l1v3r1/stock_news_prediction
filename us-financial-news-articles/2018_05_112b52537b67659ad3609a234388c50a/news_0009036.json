While the Senate bill passed with the support of 17 moderate Democrats, key members of the party including Senator Mark Warner have said they would withdraw support if any further changes are made.\nThat has raised fears among bank lobbyists that the House could sink the bill if it refused to approve the Senate version.\nBut McCarthy, a Republican, said there was a willingness on both sides to pass the bill, which would reform, rather than repeal, Dodd Frank.\n“I think you are within a month of getting it ... done,” the California lawmaker told the Milken economic conference audience in Beverly Hills.\n“At the end of the day there will be a bill at the President’s desk,” he added, pledging to deliver legislation to President Donald Trump before the 2019 midterm elections in November.\nTrump said in March that he would sign the bill once it had been approved by both the House and Senate\nLast week, Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was “certainly open to other pathways” to pass legislation aimed at helping small businesses.\nMcCarthy echoed these comments on Monday, suggesting some of the House’s wishlist could be included in separate legislation.
