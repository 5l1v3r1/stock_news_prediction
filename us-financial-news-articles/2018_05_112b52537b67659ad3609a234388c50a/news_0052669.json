In the following table, we have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or which affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. Also, we present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our businesses that are not related to currency movements.\nThe non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results:\nFirst Quarter\n2018\n2017\nSales\n$\n2,025\n$\n2,001\nPre-tax income:\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n229\n$\n269\nPre-tax adjustments excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation charge (1)\n12\n—\nAdjusted income before income taxes (non-GAAP)\n$\n241\n$\n269\nAfter-tax income:\nNet income\n$\n165\n$\n180\nAfter-tax adjustments excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation charge, net of income tax benefit of $3 and $- million, respectively (1)\n9\n—\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)\n$\n174\n$\n180\nEarnings per share:\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.38\n$\n1.36\nDiluted EPS amounts excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation charge (1)\n0.07\n—\nAdjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP)\n$\n1.45\n$\n1.36\nNotes on Non-GAAP Adjustments:\n(1)\nThe Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $12 million in connection with its U.S. retirement plan litigation during the first quarter of 2018. As disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company must reform the pension plan and the amount accrued will continue to increase with interest until paid, as required by the provisions of the required plan reformation. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $4 million representing this increase. Additionally, the amount accrued was increased by $7 million reflecting updated estimates of the cost of reformation. Finally, we incurred $1 million in administrative costs associated with the reformation.\nThe Company applied a marginal tax rate on the non-GAAP adjustment.\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(unaudited)\n(In millions)\nMay 5,\nApril 29,\n2018\n2017\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,029\n$\n1,049\nMerchandise inventories\n1,210\n1,279\nOther current assets\n301\n294\n2,540\n2,622\nProperty and equipment, net\n843\n792\nDeferred taxes\n104\n162\nOther assets\n476\n301\n$\n3,963\n$\n3,877\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n344\n$\n208\nAccrued and other liabilities\n309\n327\n653\n535\nLong-term debt\n125\n127\nOther liabilities\n642\n393\nTotal liabilities\n1,420\n1,055\nTotal shareholders' equity\n2,543\n2,822\n$\n3,963\n$\n3,877\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nStore and Square Footage\n(unaudited)\nStore activity is as follows:\nFebruary 3,\nMay 5,\nRelocations/\n2018\nOpened\nClosed\n2018\nRemodels\nFoot Locker US\n910\n—\n7\n903\n14\nFoot Locker Europe\n636\n5\n2\n639\n14\nFoot Locker Canada\n111\n—\n3\n108\n2\nFoot Locker Asia Pacific\n98\n2\n1\n99\n4\nKids Foot Locker\n436\n1\n4\n433\n1\nLady Foot Locker\n85\n—\n5\n80\n—\nChamps Sports\n541\n1\n5\n537\n5\nFootaction\n260\n—\n5\n255\n3\nRunners Point\n118\n2\n3\n117\n—\nSidestep\n83\n—\n1\n82\n—\nSIX:02\n32\n—\n1\n31\n—\nTotal\n3,310\n11\n37\n3,284\n43\nSelling and gross square footage are as follows:\nFebruary 3, 2018\nMay 5, 2018\n(in thousands)\nSelling\nGross\nSelling\nGross\nFoot Locker US\n2,430\n4,225\n2,425\n4,216\nFoot Locker Europe\n957\n2,071\n963\n2,084\nFoot Locker Canada\n264\n431\n262\n426\nFoot Locker Asia Pacific\n140\n230\n144\n236\nKids Foot Locker\n747\n1,285\n745\n1,281\nLady Foot Locker\n115\n195\n108\n185\nChamps Sports\n1,934\n2,994\n1,926\n2,982\nFootaction\n829\n1,374\n818\n1,359\nRunners Point\n150\n258\n148\n256\nSidestep\n76\n131\n76\n129\nSIX:02\n65\n109\n63\n106\nTotal\n7,707\n13,303\n7,678\n13,260\nContact:\nJames R.
