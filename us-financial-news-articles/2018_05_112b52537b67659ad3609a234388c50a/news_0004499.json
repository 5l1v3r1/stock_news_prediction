It is our big target.\n“Johann beating the factory guys on satellite machinery and consistently qualifying on the front row means he is a strong fighter with a strong sprit. I’m convinced we can reach the next level with a rider like Johann with us.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T13:39:42.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
