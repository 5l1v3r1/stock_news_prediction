Albies, now tied for the National League lead in home runs, also had a double, a walk, scored three times and drove in three runs.\nThe win was the second straight for Atlanta and gave the Braves the series win. Atlanta improved to 6-1-2 in series this season. The Braves (16-11) have not been five games over .500 since they were 6-1 on April 13, 2015.\nAtlanta put the game away with five runs in the third inning. Nick Markakis had a two-run single and Johan Camargo delivered a three-run homer, his first, during the rally.\nThe winning pitcher was Brandon McCarthy (4-0), who pitched 5 1/3 innings and allowed one run on five hits with three walks and six strikeouts. It was a nice bounce-back game for McCarthy, who was roughed up for five runs (three earned) in his last start against Cincinnati.\nAtlanta used three relievers to shut down Philadelphia over the last 3 2/3 innings. Peter Moylan (1 1/3 IP) and Sam Freeman (1/3 inning) set up Jesse Biddle, who struck out five of the six batters he faced in closing the final two frames. Biddle, a former Phillies prospect who grew up in the area, also doubled in a run in the ninth.\nVelasquez allowed six runs on seven hits in four innings, the second straight start in which he hasn’t made it past the fifth inning. He walked two and struck out four, matching his season low. It was the third straight loss for Velasquez, who has lost twice to the Braves this season.\nThe Phillies pushed across their lone run in the fourth inning on Camargo’s throwing error, which allowed Aaron Altherr to score.\nThe Braves tacked on three more runs in the eighth. Albies doubled in a pair and then scored on a double by Ronald Acuna Jr.\nThe Braves begin a three-game series in New York on Tuesday, while Philadelphia starts a three-game set at Miami on Monday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T10:02:23.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
