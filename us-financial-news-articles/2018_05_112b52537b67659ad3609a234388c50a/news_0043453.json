His exploits earned him a move to Krasnodar, where he developed into a clinical and prolific striker.\nSmolov became the Russian Premier League’s top scorer in 2015-16 with 20 goals and took the accolade again the following year with 18. He managed 14 goals this season, one fewer than Spartak Moscow’s Quincy Promes.\nThe powerful forward has scored six goals in his last 11 games for the national team including two in a heartening 3-3 comeback draw against Spain in November and one in a 3-1 defeat by France in March.\nAs well as his goals, fans admire the 28-year-old Smolov’s passion for the national team, which was on display as he cried on the pitch following the hosts’ exit from the Confederations Cup after they lost to Mexico.\nRussia have not made it out of a World Cup group stage since the collapse of the Soviet Union but they have a chance if Smolov can replicate his club form this June, when he will be hoping to turning last year’s despair into joy.\nReporting by Richard Martin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:23:59.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
