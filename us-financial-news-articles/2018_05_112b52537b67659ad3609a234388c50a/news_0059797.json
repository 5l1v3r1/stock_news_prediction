Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 30, 2018 Romania's Simona Halep celebrates winning her first round match against Alison Riske of the U.S. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\nThe Romanian world number one stayed under wraps until the fourth day of the tournament after her opening match was canceled on Tuesday evening because of a schedule backlog.\nIt appeared some of Tuesday’s rain had got into the works as she lost the opening five games, sprinkling unforced errors across Court Philippe Chatrier, but there was no sign of panic and her game eventually clicked into gear.\nThe 83rd-ranked Riske won three games in her previous claycourt meeting with the twice Roland Garros runner-up but broke serve three times in taking the opening set. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 30, 2018 Romania's Simona Halep celebrates winning her first round match against Alison Riske of the U.S. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\nHalep quickly reasserted her authority though with the depth and power of her groundstrokes stopping Riske in her tracks — conceding just 14 points in sets two and three.\n“It was good that I came back so strong,” Halep, beaten in last year’s final by Jelena Ostapenko, told reporters.
