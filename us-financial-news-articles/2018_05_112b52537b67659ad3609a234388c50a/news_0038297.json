He chatted to workmen in overalls and drove a heavy, orange truck across the bridge’s 19 km (12 miles) length.\nOn Wednesday, the road was open to the public. Some local residents on the Crimean side of the bridge waved from the roadside as a convoy of bikers, among them the leader of a pro-Kremlin biker group, tooted their horns on their way onto the peninsula.\nSome Russians have dubbed the road-and-rail bridge designed to link Crimea into Russia’s transport network “Putin’s bridge”.\nRussia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, drew sanctions and prompted a deterioration in ties with the West. Many in Russia saw the move as restoring Moscow’s rule over a historically Russian region.\nA woman takes pictures prior to the ceremony.

It’s yet more proof of this might and greatness.”\nSome Crimean residents said they had driven through the night from the peninsula’s biggest city, Sevastopol, to attend what they described as a historic moment.\n“We came to participate in the opening (of the bridge), to drive on it for the first time,” said Aleksandr Karavayev, a resident of Sevastopol.\nSlideshow (5 Images) In Kiev, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Tuesday the bridge was illegal. The European Union and the United States also used the opening of the bridge to condemn the annexation of Crimea.\nEditing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:07:04.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
