And when you say you have no government, you have no law, you have no constitution, and you don't have all those institutions which are created to give form to the government of this country.\"\n\"We need to have this government today, without delay,\" he added.\nThe 92-year-old led an opposition coalition to an unexpected victory over Najib, whose popularity had declined over rising living costs and in the wake of a multi-billion-dollar graft scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\nMahathir led the Southeast Asian nation for 22 years and his unexpected return to the prime ministership ends the previously unbroken rule of Barisan Nasional (BN), the coalition that had governed Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957.\nThe stunning election outcome was expected to ruffle financial markets that were expecting a comfortable win for Najib and the BN.\nThe national stock market was set to be closed on Thursday and Friday after Mahathir declared a public holiday, but the ringgit currency weakened in offshore trading.\n—Reuters contributed to this report.
