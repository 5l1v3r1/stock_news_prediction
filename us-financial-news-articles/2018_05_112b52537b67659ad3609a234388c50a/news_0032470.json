Furthermore, in the past 12 months, the ETF has rallied nearly 13 percent, just narrowly underperforming the S&P 500's gains of 14 percent. Despite the move higher, Carter Worth, head of technical analysis at Cornerstone Macro notes how the sector has been struggling to break above a key downtrend resistance level.\n\"The presumption would be that we're going to hit our head and get a little down arrow here,\" Worth said Friday on CNBC's \" Options Action .\" \"So I'm going to make the bet that this consecutive rally right to a downtrend line is a rally to a difficult level where overhead supply comes into play.\"\nIndustrial stocks make up more than 10 percent of the broader S&P 500 index and tend to trade best in times of economic strength. However, growing concerns over a potential trade war with China have increased volatility in the space.\nIn the interview, Worth said that shares of the ETF were at a \"critical juncture\" where the downtrend resistance and 150-day moving average meet near the $75 level.\n\"I'm going to make a bet that it's going to fail here,\" Worth cautioned.\nThe XLI ETF, which top holdings include Dow giants like Boeing , Caterpillar and General Electric , hit an all all-time high of $80.96 in January but has fallen more than 7 percent since.\nWorth also referred to a five-year chart of the industrials relative to the S&P 500, noting that despite hitting a postelection peak in November the sector has mainly been an underperformer.\n\"I'm going to make the bet that this rally, impressive as it is, is probably at a level where the next sequence is likely down not up,\" said Worth.\nShares of the XLI are down more than a 1 percent year-to-date and were trading higher Monday afternoon, around $74.50.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T21:14:57.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
