That is unnecessary in a situation where inflation is stable.”\nTraders still expect at least two more interest rate hikes this year, according to the CME’s FedWatch.\nOn Monday, the yield gap between U.S. 5-year notes and 30-year bonds narrowed to 25.90 basis points, the tightest spread in more than six years.\nThe other benchmark measure, the yield spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year notes, steepened to 44.30 basis points on Monday. But last Friday, the spread contracted to 41 basis points, the narrowest gap since at least March 2010.\nBullard pointed out that the Fed has effectively flattened the yield curve because it has raised short term rates.\nBut he agreed with the general view that the curve has flattened because traders on the long end perceive that there is low inflation.\nBullard earlier spoke at a crypto-currency and blockchain conference in New York. He said the growth in bitcoin and other digital currencies is creating a “non-uniform” currency in the United States, which in the past has existed but was ultimately rejected and replaced.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.
