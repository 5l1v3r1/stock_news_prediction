Landy, President and CEO, commented on the results of the first quarter of 2018.\n\"We are pleased to announce another solid quarter of operating results and an excellent start to 2018. Our Normalized FFO for the quarter of $0.18 per diluted share fully covered our dividend. During the quarter, we:\nIncreased Rental and Related Income by 11.2%; Increased Community Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") by 11.2%; Increased Same Property NOI by 5.4% Increased Same Property Occupancy by 140 basis points from 81.8% to 83.2%; Increased home sales by 31.7%; Increased our rental home portfolio by 165 homes to approximately 5,800 total rental homes, representing an increase of 17.7%; Increased rental home occupancy by 100 basis points from 93.7% to 94.7%; Reduced the weighted average interest rate on our mortgage debt from 4.4% to 4.2%; Maintained the weighted average interest rate on our total debt at 4.1%; Issued 2,000,000 shares of a new 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, for net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses, of approximately $48 million; Raised $10.1 million through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan; Reduced our Net Debt to Total Market Capitalization from 36.4% to 29.0% and our Net Debt Less Securities to Total Market Capitalization from 26.1% to 19.0%; and, Increased our total market capitalization to $1.1 billion, representing an increase of 8.5%.\"\nMr. Landy stated, \"Our positive results were driven by strong operating metrics. Our rental program remains the most efficient way to drive occupancy and earnings growth. During the quarter we added 165 rental homes to our communities. Our rental home portfolio now contains 5,772 homes with an occupancy rate of 94.7%.\"\n\"Home sales have been improving and increased 32% this year. The positive demographic trends and robust labor market, combined with rising conventional home prices, should favor our industry and drive further demand for our homes.\"\n\"Same Property NOI increased by 5.4% this year, driven by a 140 basis point increase in the occupancy rate and a 3.3% increase in our weighted average monthly site rent.\"\n\"During the quarter, we also enhanced our liquidity by issuing 2,000,000 shares of a new 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, for net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses, of approximately $48 million. We anticipate continued per share earnings accretion once this capital is fully deployed.\"\n\"Starting in 2018, unrealized gains or losses in value on securities holding are included in our operating numbers. The REIT market has been under pressure thus far in 2018 losing approximately 10% in value. We view this as temporary and expect the value of the companies to better reflect their earnings and underlying property values.\"\n\"We continue to execute on our business plan. We have a robust acquisition pipeline of approximately $75 million. We anticipate completing the acquisition of two of these communities, with a total of approximately 670 sites at a purchase price of $20 million, within the next few weeks. We look forward to building on the substantial progress we have made thus far.\"\nUMH Properties, Inc. will host its First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Webcast and Conference Call.

Any such are based on the Company's current expectations and involve various risks and uncertainties. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can provide no assurance those expectations will be achieved. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from expectations are contained in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and described from time to time in the Company's other filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nNote:\n(1)\nNon-GAAP Information: We assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations (\"FFO\"), which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), represents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), excluding extraordinary items, as defined under U.S. GAAP, gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. NAREIT created FFO as a non-U.S. GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Core Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\") as FFO plus costs of early extinguishment of debt, change in the fair value of marketable securities and costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock. We define Normalized Funds From Operations (\"Normalized FFO\") as Core FFO excluding gains and losses realized on marketable securities investments and certain non-recurring charges. We define Community NOI as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO, as well as Community NOI, should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, Core FFO, Normalized FFO and Community NOI and, accordingly, our FFO, Core FFO, Normalized FFO and Community NOI may not be comparable to all other REITs. The items excluded from FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO are significant components in understanding the Company's financial performance.\nFFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\nThe reconciliation of the Company's U.S. GAAP net loss to the Company's FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are calculated as follows:\nThree Months Ended\n3/31/18\n3/31/17\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$(27,155,000)\n$(1,504,000)\nDepreciation Expense\n7,595,000\n6,540,000\nLoss on Sales of Depreciable Assets\n16,000\n25,000\nFFO Attributable to Common Shareholders\n(19,544,000)\n5,061,000\nDecrease in Fair Value of Marketable Securities\n25,899,000\n-0-\nCore FFO Attributable to Common Shareholders\n6,355,000\n5,061,000\nGain on Sales of Marketable Securities, net\n(20,000)\n(32,000)\nNormalized FFO Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$6,335,000\n$5,029,000\nThe diluted weighted shares outstanding used in the calculation of Core FFO per Diluted Common Share and Normalized FFO per Diluted Common Share were 36,195,000 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and 30,427,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. Common stock equivalents resulting from stock options in the amount of 288,000 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and 472,000 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2017, are included in the diluted weighted shares outstanding. Common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the Diluted Net Loss per Share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nThe following are the cash flows provided (used) by operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n2018\n2017\nOperating Activities\n$10,290,000\n$11,626,000\nInvesting Activities\n(17,472,000)\n(49,618,000)\nFinancing Activities\n11,205,000\n43,368,000\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/umh-properties-inc-reports-results-for-the-first-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-300645765.html\nSOURCE UMH Properties, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/umh-properties-inc-reports-results-for-the-first-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-300645765.html", "http://www.umh.reit/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T00:52:33.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
