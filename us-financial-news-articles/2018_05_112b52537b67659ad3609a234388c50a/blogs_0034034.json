The venture will be led by Savage Chief Executive Kirk Aubry and include Bartlett's grain and milling businesses.\nExcluded from the deal are Bartlett's U.S. cattle feedlots, which the company says have a capacity for 100,000 animals in Kansas and Texas. Bartlett is exploring a sale for the operations, according to Savage, joining grain trader Cargill Inc and others in exiting the business.\nThroughout the agriculture supply chain, grain companies and farmers alike remain under pressure from low crop prices, following years of massive harvests of staples such as corn, wheat and soybeans. Businesses big and small in recent years have rushed to merge, establish joint ventures or acquire rivals in a bid to cut costs and stay competitive.\nBartlett has long been known as a mid-sized, family-owned grain buyer in the United States, although it is much smaller than competitors Archer Daniels Midland Co and Cargill.\nBartlett controlled the 20th largest U.S. grain storage network last year, with a capacity of 67.76 million bushels, according to Milling & Baking News, an industry publication. In comparison, ADM's storage capacity was 468.6 million bushels.\n\"Partnering with Savage makes sense logistically and strategically,\" said Bartlett CEO Bill Fellows.\nSavage Companies was established in 1946 and has more than 4,000 employees in North America and Saudi Arabia. It provides transportation and logistics services for oil refineries and other businesses.\nSavage is expanding in Mexico and expects to benefit from Bartlett's business networks there, spokesman Jeff Hymas said.\nThe combined company will also look into adapting some of Savage's facilities to handle products for Bartlett's agricultural customers and some of Bartlett's grain facilities to receive products such as oil and gas, he said.\nBartlett is more than 100 years old and has about 760 employees working in 11 U.S. states and Mexico, according to its website.\nSuch family-owned grain companies have been targeted for takeovers, said Chris Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University.\n\"There aren't many independents that are left,\" he said.
