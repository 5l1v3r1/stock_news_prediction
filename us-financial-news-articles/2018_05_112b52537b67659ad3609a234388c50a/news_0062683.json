Abiove said operations would gradually return to normal as truckers were expected to resume deliveries of raw materials in the next few hours.\n“A week, maybe 10 days will be needed for grain shipments to resume at the ports,” Lucas Trindade, a spokesperson for exporting group Anec, said. Anec said soybean exporters may declare “force majeure” on shipments, a contractual clause that releases them from obligations because of events beyond their control.\nCoffee exports from Brazil, the world’s largest producer, in May are likely to be 900,000 60-kg bags below expectations due to the protests, according to exporters association Cecafé.\nA manager for a leading coffee exporter at Santos, who asked not to be named, said there were hardly any coffee deliveries at exporting terminals during the last 10 days. Coffee is exported on containers, which are carried by trucks from warehouses to the port.\nReporting by Ana Mano and Marcelo Teixeira; Writing by Ana Mano; Editing by Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
