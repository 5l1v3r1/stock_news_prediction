In addition, the Company provided an update on its R&D programs.\n“We are moving several programs in our clinical and discovery pipeline forward and have recently initiated a Phase 1 study of PRX004 in patients with ATTR amyloidosis,” said Gene Kinney, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Prothena. “Through our recently announced neuroscience R&D collaboration with Celgene, we are advancing three discovery programs that target a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases. While we recently discontinued development of NEOD001, we remain focused on pursuing new and better treatment options for patients through a scientifically rigorous approach in our research and development efforts.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights:\nEntered into a global neuroscience research & development collaboration with Celgene Corporation to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases. The collaboration is focused on three targets implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, inducing tau, TDP-43 and a third that is undisclosed. Prothena received a $100 million upfront payment and a $50 million equity investment by Celgene and is eligible to receive future potential exercise payments and regulatory and commercial milestones for each licensed program. Prothena is also eligible to receive additional royalties on net sales of any resulting marketed products.\nPresented a broad range of scientific and health outcomes data in oral and poster presentations at the 16 th International Symposium on Amyloidosis (ISA). New research was presented at ISA relating to PRX004 for the potential treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, including a proprietary mis-TTR assay developed to measure the misfolded forms of transthyretin (TTR) protein present in plasma of patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, as well as preclinical research demonstrating that conformation-specific antibodies target misfolded TTR and induce immune mediated clearance through phagocytosis.\nAnnounced the discontinuation of development of NEOD001, an investigational antibody that was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. The decision was based on results from the Phase 2b PRONTO study and a futility analysis of the Phase 3 VITAL study.\nAchieved first-in-human dosing in a Phase 1 clinical study of PRX004 in patients with ATTR amyloidosis. PRX004 is an investigational antibody designed to target and clear the pathogenic, misfolded forms of the TTR protein found in ATTR amyloidosis without affecting the native, or normal tetrameric form of the protein. The Phase 1 study will evaluate PRX004 in patients with ATTR amyloidosis to inform possible future studies and will include the use of Prothena’s propriety mis-TTR assay as a pharmacodynamic measure of the levels of misfolded TTR species in plasma across multiple hereditary TTR mutations.\nUpcoming Research and Development Milestones\nPRX002/RG7935\nThe Phase 2 PASADENA study , initiated in the second quarter of 2017, continues to enroll patients with early Parkinson's disease\nPRX004\nThe Phase 1 study of PRX004, initiated in the second quarter of 2018, continues to enroll patients with ATTR amyloidosis, and preliminary data from this study is expected in 2019\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Updated 2018 Financial Guidance\nProthena reported a net loss of $48.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a net loss of $35.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.26, as compared to a net loss per share of $0.99 for the first quarter of 2017.\nProthena reported total revenue of $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to total revenue of $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 from our collaboration with Roche.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses totaled $34.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $25.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to higher consulting expenses, higher personnel costs, higher expense associated with PRX002/RG7935 and to a lesser extent higher clinical trial costs partially offset by lower product manufacturing expenses. R&D expenses included non-cash share-based compensation expense of $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses totaled $14.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $10.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in G&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to higher personnel costs and to a lesser extent higher legal expense. G&A expenses included non-cash share-based compensation expense of $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal non-cash share-based compensation expense was $6.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Prothena had $433.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and no debt.\nAs of April 20, 2018, Prothena had approximately 39.8 million ordinary shares outstanding.\nWith the recent discontinuation of the NEOD001 program, the Company is assessing its resources relative to its current pipeline and is developing a reorganization plan. It expects to provide an update during the second quarter on reorganization plans and financial guidance for 2018.\nAbout Prothena\nProthena Corporation plc is a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel therapies in the neuroscience and orphan categories.
