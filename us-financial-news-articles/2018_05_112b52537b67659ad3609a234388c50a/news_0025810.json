Salvini said weeks ago he would not insist on leading any government his group was a part of. “RATIONAL AND REASONABLE”\nThe parties said meetings to agree a program to cut taxes, hike welfare payments and bolster efforts to stop irregular immigration had made progress.

Some have said it’s a threat to the people,” Di Maio told reporters after meeting Salvini. “Some say it’s a threat to Europe ... but it’s not Europe that’s under threat.”\nThe Italian-German bond spread narrowed on Friday, returning to where it was before 5-Star and the League began negotiations.\nThough both parties have said they want to renegotiate the EU’s fiscal rules to allow Italy to spend more, a 5-Star source said that any plans to increase the budget deficit would be discussed with Brussels first.\n“The government will be rational and reasonable (with the public accounts),” the source said.\n5-Star’s flagship policy is universal income support for the poor, while the League’s main campaign promise was a “flat tax” of 15 percent for individuals and companies. Both policies would be costly for Italy’s strained public finances.\nThe parties have also said they want to head off a value-added tax increase worth 12.5 billion euros ($14.9 billion) due to kick in next year unless alternative deficit cuts are found.\nPresident Mattarella can veto the make-up of any new administration and would need to endorse the parties’ choice for prime minister before a government can be formed.
