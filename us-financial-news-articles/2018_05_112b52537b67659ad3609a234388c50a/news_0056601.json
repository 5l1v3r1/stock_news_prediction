An aggregate of $147.7 million principal amount of Notes are expected to be outstanding after giving effect to the Offering.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to repay drawn amounts under its existing credit facilities (the “ Existing ABL Facility ”), which in turn may be redrawn for general corporate purposes, to fund working capital and capital expenditures.\nIn addition, on May 18, 2018, Source’s Existing ABL Facility was amended to, among other things, increase availability for borrowings thereunder (subject to certain conditions) from $70 million to $88 million, reflecting an increase in the amount permitted to be borrowed under the Existing ABL Facility in compliance with the existing Note indenture.\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nThe Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The Offering is being made exclusively to qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act and pursuant to certain prospectus exemptions in Canada.\nAbout Source Energy Services Ltd.\nSource is a fully integrated producer, supplier and distributer of high quality Northern White frac sand primarily to the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.
