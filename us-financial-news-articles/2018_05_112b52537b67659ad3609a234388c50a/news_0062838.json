Southern suspended its $1.2 billion Tia Maria project in 2015. Newmont Mining Corp’s $4.8 billion gold and copper Conga project, which Buenaventura owns a 43.7 percent stake in, has been shelved since 2011.\nGobitz said Buenaventura owed it to shareholders to create a business model that paves a path to the eventual construction of Conga. “It’s part of my mandate,” Gobitz said.\nSouthern has said it hopes the government of the country’s new president, Martin Vizcarra, will issue a construction permit for Tia Maria this year.\nBut reviving Tia Maria or Conga this year, when opposing the projects could become a platform for anti-mining candidates in regional elections, might be difficult.\nGobitz added that Buenaventura has been implementing an “ambitious” plan to cut costs to trim debt as fuel prices rise.\n“This year we want to be more rigorous and critical before venturing into an investment...with disciplined control of capital expenditure,” Gobitz said.\nNew projects should deliver a return on investments of at least 15 percent, Gobitz said.\nThe company expects its production of gold and silver to rise 8 percent this year, thanks in part to its mine Tambomayo, Gobitz said.\nReporting by Teresa Cespedes; Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
