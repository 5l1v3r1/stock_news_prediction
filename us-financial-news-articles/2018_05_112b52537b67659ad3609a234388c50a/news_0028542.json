A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\nMorgan Stanley was part of a group of banks which helped Geely’s chairman buy a stake in German carmaker Daimler in a way which skirted disclosure rules.\nViolating disclosure rules can carry a penalty of up to two million euros for individuals, and up to ten percent of annual revenues for corporations.\nGeely said it had informed markets in a timely fashion. “The capital market was at all times informed about the correct number of voting rights,” Geely said in a statement.\n“However, BaFin has asked Geely to make an additional disclosure for 22 February 2018 based on a new interpretation of the legal provisions by BaFin which was published for the first time on 9 May 2018,” Geely said.
