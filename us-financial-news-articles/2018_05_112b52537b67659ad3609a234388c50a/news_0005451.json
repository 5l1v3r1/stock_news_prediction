It said the company paid Jay-Z, or Shawn Carter, more than $200 million to acquire assets associated with his Rocawear apparel brand.\n\"After the acquisition, Carter and Iconix maintained publicly-disclosed partnerships related to the Rocawear brand,\" the SEC said, but Jay-Z has failed to appear to testify about his venture with Iconix.\n\"We are aware that the SEC is seeking information on Iconix's financial reporting,\" a representative of Jay-Z said in an email to CNBC. \"Mr. Carter had no role in that reporting or Iconix's other actions as a public company. Mr. Carter is a private citizen who should not be involved in this matter.\"\nA representative from Iconix didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nThe SEC initially issued a subpoena for Jay-Z's testimony last November. The agency sent a second request in February, when Jay-Z had a new counsel. But the rapper still hasn't offered the SEC any dates for a court appearance, the filing said Thursday.\nShares of Iconix Brand Group were falling more than 9 percent Thursday afternoon following the news.\nIn addition to Rocawear, Iconix's other apparel and accessories brands include Mudd, Mossimo, Joe Boxer, Bongo and Ed Hardy.", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2018/lr24131.htm"], "published": "2018-05-03T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T19:12:48.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
