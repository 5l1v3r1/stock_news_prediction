Three other directors had resigned ahead of the vote.\nFortis has been in the middle of a five-way bidding war with local and international suitors wanting to invest in the firm or buy it. Manipal sweetened its offer for a fifth time after the Hero-Burman offer was selected, and IHH extended the acceptance period for its offer.\n($1 = 67.4500 Indian rupees) Reporting by Tanvi Mehta in BENGALURU and Zeba Siddiqui in MUMBAI; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Christopher Cushing", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T11:07:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
