Twilio also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the Notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $65 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes.\nThe Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Twilio, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Twilio’s Class A common stock or a combination thereof, at Twilio’s election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the Notes are to be determined upon pricing of the Offering.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, Twilio expects to enter into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the Offering and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “Option Counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution to Twilio’s Class A common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or to offset any cash payments Twilio is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers of the Offering exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, Twilio expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the Option Counterparties.\nTwilio expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates will enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Twilio’s Class A common stock and/or purchase shares of Twilio’s Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Class A common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, Twilio expects that the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Class A common stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of Twilio’s Class A common stock or other securities of Twilio in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the common stock or the Notes, which could affect the ability of holders of Notes to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, it could affect the number of shares of Class A common stock and value of the consideration that holders of Notes will receive upon conversion of the Notes.\nThe Notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the Notes and the shares of Twilio’s Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, the Notes and such shares, if any, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any offer or sale of, the Notes (or any shares of Twilio’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes) in any state or jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Twilio\nMore than 2 million developers around the world have used Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience.
