IDC expects “strong, double-digit growth” in the energy space between 2016 and 2021.\nKevin Treco, an associate director at the Carbon Trust, an environmental consultancy, said blockchain-based technologies could significantly change energy use in countries striving to decentralise power and boost renewable sources.\nIn Moldova, for example, cryptocurrency-funded renewable energy could reduce the country’s dependence on energy imports such as oil and gas from Russia, Vasilescu said.\nDarius Nassiry, a senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute, a British think tank, predicted that most of the growth in cryptocurrency-funded energy would occur in the developing world.\n“They have faster-growing energy needs… and a more accommodating legal and regulatory environment towards such innovations,” he said by email.\nBut a lack of understanding on how blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies work could slow their take-up in the energy sector, he added.\nFor Abraham Cambridge, the founder and CEO of Sun Exchange, the solar currency exchange system “has all the right incentives in place”.\n“It reduces the costs of going solar dramatically for the end user and makes it easy for anyone in the world to own a solar cell anywhere in the world and, from it, make a steady source of sunlight-powered income,” he\nBlockchain is also being used in the energy sector to facilitate carbon trading, with U.S. computing giant IBM announcing this week that it will partner with Veridium Labs, an environmental tech start-up, to turn carbon credits into digital tokens.\nIf the Moldovan solar currency pilot is successful, UNDP plans to replicate it in neighbouring countries, said Vasilescu, adding that it could \"revolutionise the renewable energy market for Eastern Europe and Central Asia\".
