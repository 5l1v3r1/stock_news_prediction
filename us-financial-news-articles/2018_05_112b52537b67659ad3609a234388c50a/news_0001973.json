He denies the allegations.\nNECESSARY DECISION The Academy provided financial support for a cultural club run by Arnault and Frostenson.\nThree members of the Academy’s board resigned because of dissatisfaction over the way a probe into the allegations was conducted. The Academy’s head and Frostenson also subsequently stepped down followed by a sixth member last week.\nAnders Olsson, the acting permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, announces that the Swedish Academy postpones the award of 2018 Nobel literature prize, during an interview to the Swedish newsagency TT News Agency, in Stockholm, Sweden, May 4, 2018. TT News Agency/Janerik Henriksson/via REUTERS “It think this was a necessary decision, mainly in regard to the legitimacy of the prize,” Peter Englund, one of the six members to have left the Academy in recent weeks, told Reuters in an email regarding the decision to postpone the prize.\nThe Academy also disclosed that an investigation had shown that the names of some prize winners - the subject of lively betting - had been leaked.\nArnault denies all allegations, regarding both sexual misconduct and leaking the names of laureates, his lawyer told Reuters on Thursday.\nState prosecutors opened an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations, but said in March the probe into assaults alleged to have been committed between March 2013 and April 2015 had been dropped due to a lack of evidence and the statute of limitations having passed for some of the incidents.\nProsecutor Christina Voigt told Reuters on Friday a preliminary investigation concerning Arnault was still underway, but declined to say how many alleged incidents this involved.\nTRANSPARENCY The Nobel prizes and the international attention they bring are a source of pride for Sweden and the Academy has promised to improve transparency and bring its ancient rules up to date.\nPrevious breaks in the annual tradition go back to World War Two. There were no awards between 1940 and 1943, while American novelist William Faulkner received his prize a year late in 1950 when two prizes were handed out.\nThe Nobel Foundation, which administers the estate of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, said the crisis at the Academy had “adversely affected” the Nobel Prize.\n“Their decision underscores the seriousness of the situation and will help safeguard the long-term reputation of the Nobel Prize,” the Foundation said in statement.\nArcane rules that make appointments for life have so far meant that the 18 Academy members have not been able to technically resign and the body had already been decimated even before the recent string of defections.\nSlideshow (6 Images) Two members had ceased participating in the Academy’s work over its initial refusal to explicitly condemn a fatwa issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini calling on Muslims to kill British-Indian author Salman Rushdie because of perceived blasphemy in his novel “The Satanic Verses”.\nThe Swedish King this week changed the rules, making it possible to appoint new members.\nReporting by Simon Johnson, Niklas Pollard, Johan Sennero and Esha Vaish; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T10:46:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
