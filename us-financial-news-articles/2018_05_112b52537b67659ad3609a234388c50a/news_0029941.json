He allowed four hits, struck out seven and walked five.\nRelievers Reyes Moronta, Will Smith and Hunter Strickland preserved the shutout.\nPittsburgh had its five-game winning streak halted and missed a chance to sweep the series.\nPirates starter Ivan Nova (2-3) allowed four runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts and no walks. He does not have a win since April 15.\nGiants outfielder Andrew McCutchen, who made an emotional return to PNC Park after starring for the Pirates for most of a decade, was 4-for-14 in the series with three doubles, a single and a walk, including 1-for-4 Sunday to extend his hitting streak to 12 games.\nThe Pirates had homered nine times in three games and 12 times in five contests, and the Giants had given up 20 homers in 11 games and 15 homers during their six-game losing streak. The tables turned Sunday, with none of Pittsburgh’s seven hits leaving the park and San Francisco hitting two out.\nSan Francisco batted around in the fifth. Hernandez led off with his second homer, to left, for a 1-0 Giants lead. Brandon Belt singled an out later and, after Evan Longoria struck out, Pablo Sandoval reached on an infield single and was replaced by pinch runner Gregory Blanco.\nBrandon Crawford doubled in Belt to make it 2-0 and chase Nova. Hundley sent reliever Richard Rodriguez’s first pitch over the wall in left for a three-run homer and a 5-0 lead. It was Hundley’s second homer after he did not hit any last year.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
