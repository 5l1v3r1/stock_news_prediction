Resistance is the only way to confront these enemies, not diplomacy,\" Fars quoted him as saying.\nTrump also said on Tuesday he would revive U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, penalising foreign firms doing business with Tehran and further undermining what he called \"a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made\".\nEuropeans fear a collapse of the deal could raise the risk of deepening conflicts in the Middle East.\nEarly on Thursday, Iranian forces launched their first attack on Israel from inside Syria, firing rockets at army bases in the Golan Heights, Israel said.\nThat prompted one of the heaviest Israeli barrages against Syria since the conflict there began in 2011.\nThe pact, the signature foreign policy achievement of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear bomb in exchange for lifting most sanctions that had crippled its economy. Sanctions were removed in 2016.\nTrump complained that the agreement failed to address Irans ballistic missile programme, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in conflicts in the Middle East, where Tehran has been involved in a proxy war from Lebanon to Yemen for decades.\nIn defiance of Western pressure to curb the missile programme, Tehran says it is essential precautionary defence against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel.\n\"Exiting the deal and their concerns over Iran's missile work are excuses to bring our nation to its knees,\" Salami said.\nThe IRGC's overseas arm, the Quds force, operates in Iraq, Syria and Yemen among other places.\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi Editing by Gareth Jones and John Stonestreet)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:04:21.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
