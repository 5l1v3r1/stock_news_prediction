(NASDAQ: AMOT) (“Company”), a designer and manufacturer that sells precision motion control products and solutions to the global market, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Reported results include the acquisition of the original equipment steering business of Maval Industries, LLC (“Maval”) in January 2018.\nFirst quarter revenue increased 25% to a record $76.6 million driven primarily by organic growth Operating income grew $2.0 million, or 47%, to $6.4 million; Operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 8.4% Net Income rose 58% to $4.2 million; Earnings per share increased $0.16 to $0.45 Orders increased 33% over the prior year; Backlog grew 7% sequentially to a new record level of $107.3 million Acquired the original equipment (“OE”) steering business of Maval Industries, LLC enabling Allied to provide a fully integrated steering system solution to its customers\n“Building market momentum, the traction gained in our targeted markets, and our recent acquisition contributed to record sales in the first quarter,” commented Dick Warzala, Chairman and CEO of Allied Motion. “We are laser-focused on executing our strategy for growth while streamlining the organization and emphasizing continuous improvement in quality, delivery, cost and innovation as we drive the One Allied approach and expand our value proposition for our customers.”\nMr. Warzala concluded, “We continue to be excited about our future and are well positioned to take share in our served markets, many of which are also experiencing a lift from the improved economic environment. We are also encouraged with the prospects of our latest acquisition, and although the gross margin contribution is lower than our typical technology based solutions, it enhances our value proposition, deepens customer relationships and is expected to be neutral to slightly accretive to earnings in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results (Narrative compares with prior-year period unless otherwise noted)\nRecord revenue of $76.6 million was up $15.2 million, or 25%. The increase was due to growth across all of the Company’s served markets, and reflects significantly higher sales to the Industrial/Electronics and Vehicle markets. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX), first quarter revenue was $72.5 million, up 18%. Sales to U.S. customers were 53% of total sales for the quarter compared with 54% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.\nGross profit rose $4.9 million, or 27%, to $22.6 million, while gross margin improved 60 basis points to 29.5%. The expansion in gross margin was due to more favorable mix and higher volume, somewhat offset by a lower margin contribution from the recent acquisition and a lack of leverage from FX revenue expansion.\nOperating costs and expenses were up $2.8 million to $16.1 million. General and administrative expense as a percent of sales increased 30 basis points to 9.7% primarily due to higher incentive compensation and additional personnel to support the Company’s growth. Engineering and development (“E&D”) was $5.0 million, up 18%, though as a percent of revenue, E&D decreased 30 basis points to 6.5%. The $151 thousand in business development costs in the 2018 first quarter was primarily from the Maval acquisition.\nOperating income was up 47%, or $2.0 million, to $6.4 million, and operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 8.4%.\nInterest expense increased $91 thousand to $0.6 million as the Company took on additional debt to fund part of the Maval acquisition.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.2% compared with 31.0% in the prior-year period. The Company anticipates its effective tax rate for 2018 to range from 22% to 26%. Net income increased 58% to $4.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, from $2.7 million, or 0.29 per diluted share.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense and business development costs (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was $9.7 million, up $2.5 million or 34%. As a percent of sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 12.7% compared with 11.9% in the prior-year period. The Company believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, helps in the understanding of its operating performance. See the attached table for a description of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation table for Adjusted EBITDA.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Review\nAllied Motion purchased substantially all of the operating assets associated with the original equipment steering business of Maval Industries, LLC on January 19, 2018. The acquisition was funded with debt, cash generated from operations and cash on hand. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter were $13.0 million compared with $15.6 million at the end of 2017. Total debt was $63.4 million at the end of the first quarter, up $10.3 million from year-end 2017. Debt, net of cash, was $50.4 million, or 34.6% of net debt to capitalization, up from 30.1% at the end of 2017.\nCapital expenditures of $2.2 million included productivity and growth initiatives. The Company continues to expect to invest $13 million to $16 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2018. The higher level of capital expenditures when compared with 2017 reflects success based expenditures in support of the significant recent project wins announced over the last year.\nOrders and Backlog Summary ($ in thousands)\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ2 2017\nQ1 2017\nOrders $ 80,699 $ 72,764 $ 72,964 $ 65,754 $ 60,459 Backlog $ 107,321 $ 100,708 $ 93,547 $ 85,250 $ 77,954 The year-over-year increase in orders and backlog reflect strength across all of the Company’s served markets as well as the Maval acquisition. The impact on orders from FX fluctuations was favorable $4.1 million year-over-year.\nBacklog was up 38% over the prior year period and increased nearly 7% since fourth quarter 2017. The time to convert the majority of backlog to sales is approximately three to six months. Not included in the backlog are previously announced new business awards of $225.0 million that were received over the last year and will start shipping in 2019.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 11:00 am ET.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Company’s operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Company’s management to evaluate and compare the core operating performance of its business from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, stock-based compensation expense, business development costs related to acquisitions, and other items that are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 4,198 $ 2,657 Interest expense 614 523 Provision for income tax 1,493 1,195 Depreciation and amortization 2,791 2,450 EBITDA $ 9,096 $ 6,825 Stock compensation expense 496 466 Business development costs 151 - Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,743 $ 7,291\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006719/en/\nAllied Motion Technologies Inc.\nSue Chiarmonte, 716-242-8634 x602\nsue.chiarmonte@alliedmotion.com\nor\nInvestors:\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
