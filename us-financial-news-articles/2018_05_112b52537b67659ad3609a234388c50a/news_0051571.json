Employees also will view a film called \"You're Welcome\" by Stanley Nelson and participate in discussion and problem-solving sessions on identifying and avoiding bias in every day situations.\nStarbucks said the long-term program is being designed and developed with input from researchers, social scientists, employees and other advisers.\nThose partners include consultancy SY Partners - which worked with Starbucks to reinvent itself after a business crisis spawned by the \"Great Recession\"; the Perception Institute; Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; Bryan Stevenson, executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative; and Heather McGhee, president of public policy group Demos.\nSince the Philadelphia incident, Starbucks has said it will allow people to sit in its cafes and use its restrooms without making a purchase. It also said it has outlined procedures for dealing with customers who are disruptive, using tobacco, drugs or alcohol or sleeping in its cafes.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Tom Brown)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:23:50.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
