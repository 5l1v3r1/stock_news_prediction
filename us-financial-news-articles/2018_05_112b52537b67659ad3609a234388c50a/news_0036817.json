They floated at a price of $14 almost six years ago.\nExecutive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward said talk of the creation of a 24-team Club World Cup tournament illustrated the importance of the game to broadcasters.\n“We believe live sports content will become increasingly more valuable in the future,” Woodward told analysts.\nUnited have won the English league title a record 20 times but their performance has slipped in the recent seasons. However, finishing second in the English Premier League is enough to guarantee a place in next season’s Champions League.\nUnited actually took a slightly larger share of Premier League income than City based on having more of their matches shown live.\nThe club’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation for the three months to March 31 rose to 36.1 million pounds ($48.71 million) from 30 million pounds a year ago.\nRevenue for the period rose 8.1 percent to 137.5 million pounds.
