We are effectively executing on all fronts. As our revenues grow, gross profits are increasing at a higher rate, resulting in narrowing operating and net losses.\n\"Having completed a $6.6 million raise during the first quarter, we are investing in our commercialization capabilities, including boosting our business-to-business Dario Engage platform, especially in the U.S. with an extended commercialization team, and also further building upon the success we are achieving in the direct-to-consumer market. A substantial global market opportunity is present and we believe DarioHealth has the technology, products, market access and team to best serve the stakeholders in this market.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Summary\nRevenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1,756,000, a 74% increase from $1,007,000 in first quarter ended March 31, 2017, and an 11.3% increase sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 included direct-to-consumer sales in the United States and Australia, as well as initial sales in Germany, and product sales to distributors in the United Kingdom.\nGross profit increased by $446,000, a 420% increase to a profit of $552,000 in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a gross profit of $106,000 in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased by $1.3 million to $2.88 million, as compared to a $4.2 million operating loss in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This decrease is mainly due to the improvement in our gross profit and a decrease in our operating expenses due a reduction in share-based compensation.\nNet loss attributable to holders of common stock decreased by $2.5 million to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, and decreased by $346,000 as compared to $3.26 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $7 million following the raise of $6.6 million during the quarter in a private placement.\nConference Call Details:\nDate: Tuesday, May 15, 2018\nTime: 9:00am EDT\nDial-in Number: 1-877-407-8035\nInternational Dial-in Number: 1-201-689-8035\nWebcast: http://www.investorcalendar.com/event/27776\nAbout DarioHealth Corp.\nDarioHealth Corp.
