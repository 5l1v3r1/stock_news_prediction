Mr Walt who retired earlier this year as the President of Siemens Healthineers, Laboratory Diagnostics, is a member of Quotient's Board of Directors, and had been appointed as the interim Chief Executive Officer recently in March.\nHeino von Prondzynski the Chairman of Quotient’s board of directors commented, “I have had the pleasure of working with and observing Franz’s career as he took on a variety of ever increasing responsibilities during the last 20 years. I speak for the whole board in saying we are confident that Franz brings a skill set and experiences that match very well with the needs of Quotient in this next stage of its development.”\nFranz Walt added, “When I joined the board of Quotient earlier this year, I was inspired by the Company’s vision of microarray technology taking a leading position in the field of diagnostic screening. Having engaged with the team and learned more about the capabilities of MosaiQ I am more enthusiastic than ever about the potential of MosaiQ as a transformational platform. While taking this responsibility was not my original plan when I joined the board I am very excited about the potential to make a positive contribution to the introduction of such a ground breaking diagnostic technology.”\nMr Walt has 30 years' experience in leadership roles at two of the largest and most influential global healthcare companies, Siemens Healthineers and Roche. As President, Laboratory Diagnostics at Siemens Healthineers, Franz was responsible for the recent global launch of Siemens’ next generation laboratory diagnostics platform, the Atellica Solution. Franz Walt said, “Quotient has a high quality team that I have enjoyed getting to know over the last two months. I am looking forward to working with them to provide support and direction as MosaiQ advances.”\nMosaiQ Platform\nMosaiQ, Quotient's next-generation platform is designed to deliver fast, comprehensive antigen typing, antibody detection and disease screening results, using a single low volume sample in a high throughput automated format. MosaiQ represents a transformative and highly disruptive unified testing platform for transfusion diagnostics. Feasibility has also been demonstrated with respect to the detection of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) using the MosaiQ platform. Through MosaiQ, Quotient expects to deliver substantial value to donor testing laboratories worldwide by providing affordable, routine comprehensive characterization and screening of blood products, on a single automated instrument platform designed to radically reduce labor costs and complexity associated with existing practice.\nAbout Quotient Limited\nQuotient is a commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the provision of innovative tests within established markets.
