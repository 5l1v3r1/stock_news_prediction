They did not want to be identified as the talks are private.\nLeong Hup could not be reached for comment while Maybank and Credit Suisse declined to comment. JP Morgan did not respond to an email query.\nLast year, Leong Hup told local media it was planning a listing on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange to raise funds for regional expansion, acquisitions as well as research and development.\nThe company, whose businesses include poultry farming and animal feed production, is majority owned by the founding Lau family. Private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners has owned a 23 percent stake in the business since 2014, showed Leong Hup’s website.\nIt has operations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines. Its consumer brands include Ayam A1 and SunnyGold in Malaysia.\nIf Leong Hup succeeds in raising $600 million, it would be Malaysia’s biggest IPO since Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd raised about $875 million in July last year.\nOther Malaysian firms in the IPO pipeline include Malaysia’s largest fast-food operator QSR Brands, which is looking to raise about $500 million.\nReporting by A.
