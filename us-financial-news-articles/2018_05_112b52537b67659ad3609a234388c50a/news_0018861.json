Every year, celebrities who attend show off outrageous fashion on the event's red carpet.\nThough Jonas' trip was cheap, the star was wearing a suit by Dolce & Gabbana. Men's suits by the designer can cost thousands of dollars, but stars are often gifted or allowed to borrow fashion for such big events. He was also sporting a golden cross to match the event's \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination\" theme. (In 2016, Jonas wore a more affordable $100 suit by Topman to the Met Ball.)\nVia an Instagram Story, Jonas documented his ride on the 6 train to 77th Street and Lexington Avenue, People reports. On Twitter, fans spotted Jonas hopping off the train. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T19:35:17.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
