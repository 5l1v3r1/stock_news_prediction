(UCI), the leading media company serving Hispanic America, and the rising, diverse American mainstream, today announced that Randy Falco will retire from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer. He will remain an advisor to the Company through the end of 2018 to ensure a smooth transition.

Sadusky will also become a member of the Univision Board of Directors.\nHaim Saban, Chairman of the Board of Directors of UCI, said, “Over the last eight years, Randy has led the transformation of UCI into a modern media organization with a diverse portfolio of assets, sterling brands and content that audiences and marketers want, backed by strong earnings growth, a significantly improved balance sheet and a team of motivated and purpose-driven employees. Randy has always recognized and embraced Univision as an incredibly unique company with a mission and vision that goes well beyond traditional media. On behalf of the entire Board, I want to thank Randy for his leadership, commitment and partnership, and congratulate him on his retirement.”\nFalco commented, “Leading UCI has been one of the most personally and professionally rewarding experiences of my life. So much has changed – and will continue to change – in the media landscape but through it all one thing remains true: no other media company serves and supports Hispanic America like UCI, something that is more important than ever in our world today. I believe wholeheartedly in UCI’s mission and vision and am confident that the Company will remain on a path for continued success with Vince leading the way.”\nSadusky, 53, brings to Univision a wealth of knowledge and experience in the media industry and a track record as an effective and innovative leader.

This is a unique moment for UCI, and we believe that we have the right strategy and team in place to execute on the opportunities in front of us. On behalf of the entire Board, we look forward to working with Vince to achieve great success for UCI.”\nSadusky commented, “It’s an honor and privilege to have the opportunity to serve as CEO of UCI, a company I have long admired for its important mission to serve as a lifeline and advocate for its community, and the strong bonds it has built with its audience. I am eager to work with UCI’s talented team to enhance the Company’s leadership position and underscore its crucial role as a source of news and information. Over the last few months, UCI has taken a number of steps to evolve and thrive in today’s rapidly changing media environment and I am committed to ensuring the Company is in the best position possible to serve its audiences for decades to come.”\nUnivision continues to hold its strong leadership position as it finished as the No. 1 Spanish-language network in primetime for the 26th consecutive year during May 2018 Sweep and the 2017-2018 broadcast season, outperforming Telemundo by double-digit audience advantages among Total Viewers 2+, Adults 18-49 and Adults 18-34.
