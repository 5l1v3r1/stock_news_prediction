Operating centers in Maine; Georgia; near-shore; as well as Work@Home, Argo supports a wide variety of clients in numerous industry groups. Argo was acquired by ITC Capital Partners, a privately held equity firm with a 100-year history, based in West Point, Georgia. Among the key differentiators that would support this position is the belief that core values coupled with a business systems approach to the contact center industry, would yield a better level of service, and a greater opportunity to enhance the market position of the customers it serves. This significant shift in management, together with several other attributes, contributes to the Argo difference.\nAbout ITC Capital Partners, LLC\nITC Capital Partners, LLC was formed based upon the successful investment history of the ITC Holding Company, LLC which was founded in 1896. ITC Capital Partners, LLC invests in entrepreneurs whose ideas and values are consistent with those of our founders.
