In a statement, April said it “regularly monitors developments in the global pulp industry”, but declined to comment on the deal. Lwarcel declined to comment.\nLwarcel has one pulp-producing unit in the state of Sao Paulo with 250,000 annual tonnes in capacity, and the expected value of the deal is around 2 billion reais ($586 million), the sources said.\nLwarcel was put up for sale a year ago by its controlling family Trecenti. Brazil’s Suzano Papel e Celulose SA had been discussing Lwarcel’s acquisition before talks accelerated to acquire rival Fibria Celulose SA.\nSuzano won the battle for Fibria in March, creating the world’s largest wood pulp producer. Indonesia’s Paper Excellence’s bid was higher but lacked funding.\nAfter the Fibria deal, Lwarcel had to go back to other bidders to discuss the sale.\nNewspaper Valor Econômico reported earlier on Tuesday that April was the leading contender in Lwarcel’s sale process.\nReporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Leslie Adler and Stephen Coates\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
