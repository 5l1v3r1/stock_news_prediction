People who live there are divided over which side to back. Last week, dozens of people were killed in clashes between troops from the two sides.\n“Due to the dispute over the regions of Sool and Sanaag and lack of access to some affected areas after the destruction of roads, the situation of affected populations and impediments caused by blocked roads and failed communications, the extent of the damage is yet to be fully confirmed,” the UN said.
