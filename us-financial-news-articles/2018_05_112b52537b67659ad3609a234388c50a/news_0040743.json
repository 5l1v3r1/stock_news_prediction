We also remember our long-term strategic commitment that the dividend per share is to rise year on year in the long term,” PZU CEO Pawel Surowka said in a statement.\nOn Tuesday PZU said it plans to earmark 2.16 billion zloty for its 2017 dividend, or 2.5 zloty per share.\nAnalysts will look to a PZU news conference scheduled for 1000 local time (0800 GMT) for more on PZU’s stance regarding the merger of its two banks - Bank Pekao SA and Alior Bank, an idea promoted by Pekao.\nPekao has delayed until this quarter the release of its assessment of whether a merger would be beneficial. Many analysts expect it to back the idea.\nState-run PZU’s shares are down almost seven percent this year, broadly in line with the Warsaw bourse’s main index , which has lost 7.5 percent.\n$1 = 3.6325 zlotys Reporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:31:36.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
