He had refused to appear before the committee last month, citing the ongoing investigation into the firm.\nSeparately, it was announced that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with leaders of the European Parliament in a closed-door meeting next Tuesday about the data protection scandal that has engulfed his company.\nEven though his visit had been announced, it was left unclear exactly when Zuckerberg would visit the European Union's legislature.\nThe EU and British parliaments have been calling for Zuckerberg to appear before them for weeks ever since it emerged that Cambridge Analytica had been allowed to misuse the data of millions of Facebook users.\nThe EU meeting however is set to be private with the leaders of the political groups and a justice and civil rights expert.
