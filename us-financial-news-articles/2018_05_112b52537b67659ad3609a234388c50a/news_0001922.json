It’s still up in the air whether or not there will be a push for fresh elections come the summer,” he said.\nItalian politics have been in limbo since an inconclusive March 4 vote, which saw a centre-right alliance led by the anti-immigrant League win the most seats and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerge as the biggest single party.\nThe 5-Star leader has called for new elections next month.\nOn Wednesday, a presidential palace source told Reuters President Sergio Mattarella wants a new government in place to pass the 2019 budget.\nElsewhere, most better-rated euro zone bond yields rose 2-3 bps on the day. An overnight rise in U.S. Treasury yields weighed on sentiment as did euro zone economic growth data that was stronger than some economists expected.\nGermany’s 10-year Bund yield, the benchmark for the bloc, rose to 0.58 percent, but held below six-week highs set last week above 0.65 percent.\nGross domestic product across the euro zone expanded by 0.4 percent in the first quarter compared to the last quarter of 2017 and by 2.5 percent year on year, EU statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.\nA softening in the euro zone’s strong growth momentum and still-subdued inflation have prompted investors to push back their European Central Bank rate-hike expectations.\nIn contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve is in the middle of a rate-hiking cycle although no changes to monetary policy are expected when the bank concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n“Euro zone markets are in wait-and-see mode until the Fed meeting,” ING rates strategist Martin van Vliet said.\nU.S. Treasury yields also faced upward pressure ahead of Wednesday’s quarterly refunding announcement that is expected to show more supply as the government seeks to fund its massive tax cut programme and increased fiscal spending.
