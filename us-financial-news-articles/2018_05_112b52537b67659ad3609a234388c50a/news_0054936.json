REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo “They committed to remaining closely coordinated in all of their efforts to create conditions for dialogue with North Korea and agreed that must continue until North Korea embraces denuclearization,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.\nShe said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula “and to the ironclad alliance” between the United States and South Korea.\nTrump on Friday dangled the possibility of putting his June 12 meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un back on the schedule, telling reporters that the administration was talking to North Korea about the potential for a meeting.\nTrump scrapped the summit in a letter to Kim on Thursday after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out over what it saw as confrontational remarks by U.S. officials demanding unilateral disarmament. Trump cited North Korean hostility in canceling the summit.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T22:59:52.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
