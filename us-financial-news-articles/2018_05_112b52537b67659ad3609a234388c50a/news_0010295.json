One lender traded the currency at 314.50 naira on Thursday.\nTANZANIA The Tanzanian shilling is seen holding steady or strengthening marginally against the U.S. dollar in the days ahead, helped by expected inflows of hard currency from the agriculture sector.\nCommercial banks Quote: d the shilling at 2,283/2,288 to the dollar on Thursday, weaker than 2,278/2,288 two weeks ago. There was no foreign exchange trading on Thursday last week due to a public holiday.\n“There is some resistance on the 2,290 level, so we expect the shilling to remain range-bound or appreciate slightly next week due to the onset on the cotton export season,” said a trader at CRDB Bank.
