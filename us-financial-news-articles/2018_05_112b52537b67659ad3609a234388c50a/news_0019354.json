REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl/File Photo “You heard last night that the president of America made some silly and superficial comments,” said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “He had maybe more than 10 lies in his comments. He threatened the regime and the people, saying I’ll do this and that. Mr. Trump I tell you on behalf of the Iranian people: You’ve made a mistake.”\nKhamenei, the highest authority in Iran, reluctantly gave his backing for the Iran nuclear deal and has publicly criticized the U.S. multiple times for not following through on its promises under the agreement.\n(This version of the story corrects Quote: in second paragraph to read “... saying I’ll do this and that...” not “... you’re doing this and that...”)\nReporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T13:21:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
