By facilitating the transfer of European customers to our existing Luxembourg range we will ensure they can continue to access our best investment strategies in a UCITS-compliant fund, regardless of the final agreement between the UK and the EU,” Michelle Scrimgeour, CEO, EMEA at Columbia Threadneedle said in a statement on Wednesday.\n“For EU investors, the transfers will remove uncertainty regarding the future status of their investment in their home country,” she added.
