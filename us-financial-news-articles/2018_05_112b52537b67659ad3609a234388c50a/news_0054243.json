And the continued pullback in yields have spelled weakness in the financials,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\nThe S&P 500 banks index fell 0.5 percent after U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest level in three weeks.\nStock markets this week have been roiled by trade tensions with China, a U.S. threat of imposing tariffs on imported cars and uncertainty over a U.S.-North Korea summit.\nPresident Donald Trump said on Friday the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could still take place on June 12 as originally planned, a day after canceling it.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.25 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,748.51, the S&P 500 lost 7.4 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,720.36 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.38 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,432.81.\nTrading volumes were thin ahead of the long weekend, with markets shut on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.\nThe Nasdaq was boosted by chipmakers, led by a 2.6 percent jump in Broadcom.\nA 19.6 percent surge in shares of Foot Locker boosted the consumer discretionary index after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and lifted shares in Nike, which has a partnership with the footwear retailer.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 100 new highs and 36 new lows.
