He has not yet entered a plea to any of the charges against him.\nInvestigators finally cracked the Sacramento case, which has long haunted victims’ families and law enforcement, by comparing crime scene DNA to genetic information on commercial genealogy websites that consumers use to explore their ancestry.\nDetectives followed the family trees of close matches, seeking people who might be the killer. The process produced a promising lead a week ago, when the DNA of a relative pointed to DeAngelo based on his age and the fact that he lived near where the attacks occurred.\nDeAngelo was identified as a suspect about two months after the case gained renewed attention in the book, “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark,” by journalist Michelle McNamara, who died in 2016 and was married to the actor Patton Oswalt.
