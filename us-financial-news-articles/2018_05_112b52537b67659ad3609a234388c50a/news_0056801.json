Security Council resolutions.\nA Japanese P-3 maritime patrol plane detected the vessels, which lay alongside each other connected by hoses, on May 19, with one of the ships flying what seemed like a Chinese flag, it said.\nChina has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing U.N. sanctions against North Korea and it would punish any Chinese company breaking them.\nJapan’s decision to voice its suspicion comes as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump prepared for what may be a breakthrough summit as early as next month.\nJapan is urging the United States and other countries to stick to a strict imposition of U.N. sanctions on North Korea until it abandons the development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\nIn April, the U.N. Security Council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies over oil and coal smuggling by North Korea, including five based in China. The vessels are subject to a global port ban and must be deregistered.\nReporting by Tim Kelly; Additional reporting by Ben blanchard in BEIJING; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T12:50:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
