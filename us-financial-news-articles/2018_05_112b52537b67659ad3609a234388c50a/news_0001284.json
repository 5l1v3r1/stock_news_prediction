The report said crash rates fell by 40 percent after installation of Autopilot's Autosteer function, and noted that this number was derived from Tesla airbag deployment data.\nThe agency said on Wednesday its crash rate comparison \"did not evaluate whether Autosteer was engaged\" and \"did not assess the effectiveness of this technology.\"\nThe agency described the Autopilot analysis in the 2017 report as a \"cursory comparison\" of airbag deployment rates before and after installation of the feature to determine whether models with Autosteer had higher crash rates. Such a finding \"could have indicated that further investigation was necessary,\" the agency said.\nTesla declined to comment.\nIn March, Tesla said that over a year ago, the U.S. government found that its first iteration of Autopilot reduced crash rates by as much as 40 percent. \"Internal data confirms that recent updates to Autopilot have improved system reliability,\" it added.\nOn Jan. 19, 2017, Musk tweeted: \"The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.\" Autosteer, a system that automatically keeps the vehicle in the center of a lane, is part of the Autopilot technology package.\nThe 2017 NHTSA probe found no evidence of a defect. Investigations into the death of Walter Huang, the driver in the March 23 Tesla car crash, are ongoing.\nThe NTSB confirmed last month it had two other pending investigations of incidents involving Tesla vehicles, including an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, after an owner lost control and ran the vehicle into his garage.\nThe NTSB previously faulted Tesla in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida in which Autopilot was engaged. NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said in 2017 that \"system safeguards were lacking.\"\nHe also noted that \"Tesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.\"\nTesla said it had improved the system since the crash.\nTesla on Wednesday told investors in its quarterly financial report that on March 15 it released a \"significant Autopilot update\" that has been well received by its customers.
