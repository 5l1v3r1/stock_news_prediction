The research produced one of the industry’s most successful weight loss programs and the underlying philosophy became the foundation of the company’s CalorieSmart® ethos for pet wellness and health. Today, the Fruitables brand has evolved into a full line of natural CalorieSmart® treats, broths and toppers.\nThe acquisition follows several other pet company acquisitions by Manna Pro that have expanded their product lines into the wellness, grooming, oral care and flea and tick categories.\n“Fruitables treats and supplements will be a strong addition to our portfolio of premium pet products,” said Manna Pro President and CEO John Howe. “Consumers are feeding their pets similarly to how they are eating, and Fruitables has been an early leader in offering healthy options. Working closely with independent pet retailers, Fruitables have helped pet owners address health conditions and provide preventive care. We remain committed to those retailers and Fruitables loyal followers.”\n“Our company’s goal has always been to be an innovative leader in pet health,” said Fruitables Founder and CEO Kevin Swenke. “We are pleased that Manna Pro, a company that is also known for its innovation, high and consistent quality, and excellent customer service, will carry on our mission.”\nAbout Manna Pro\nManna Pro Products produces high-quality animal nutrition and care products for a broad range of animals. Its largest group of products is associated with horses, but the company also produces feed for backyard poultry and goats, rabbits, cattle, pigs and companion animals. Manna Pro’s product lines primarily serve the “lifestyle farmer” market – people who own acreage with farm animals, and operate their farms as a hobby rather than a business. The company’s flagship product – Calf-Manna® – has been a staple of animal owners for more than 80 years. Manna Pro’s recently expanded Pet Care/Companion Animal business offers canine and feline health and wellness supplements.
