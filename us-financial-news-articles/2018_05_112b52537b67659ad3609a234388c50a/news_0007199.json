The number of active customers also rose to 218,187 from 71,827 a year ago.\nCore earnings rose to $237.3 million from $45.8 million, while revenue surged nearly four times to $297.3 million.\nPlus500 said the high levels of new customer sign ups it saw in the first quarter had returned to more typical levels in the last two months, adding that it did not expect the first quarter growth to be repeated in the remainder of the year.\nThe company, which provides an online trading platform for retail customers to trade contracts for differences (CFDs), had said in February it expected 2018 revenue to be significantly ahead of market expectations.\nThe board on Tuesday reiterated the same expectation for forecast-beating financial performance for the year, without providing details on new targets, citing the company’s low cost base and flexible business model.\nThe European Union’s securities watchdog said last month it would ban ‘binary’ options sales to retail clients and restrict the sales of CFDs to protect investors from significant losses, knocking shares in Britain’s spreadbetters.\nPlus 500 said on Tuesday it had also started a process to look at whether its experienced customers could be reclassified as professional investors, and retain the right to trade using higher leverage.
