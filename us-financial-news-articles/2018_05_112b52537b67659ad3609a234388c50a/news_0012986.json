(\"Imex\" or the \"Company\") (TSX VENTURE:IMEX), a software solution provider to Governments, Municipalities and Public Authorities, wishes to announce a cease trade order (\"CTO\") has been issued by the Ontario Securities Commission on May 4, 2018 for not filing its annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the \"2017 Financial Disclosure\") as required to be filed by April 30, 2018.\nThe delay in filing the 2017 Annual Audited Financial Statements is principally related to the Company requiring additional time to complete a restatement of the audited financials statements for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 due to the Company taking a write-down on the amounts owed to the Company under its contract with the Government of Botswana.\nEffective April 2, 2018, the Company filed a Change of Auditor Notice on SEDAR detailing the resignation of its former auditor effective April 2, 2018. The Company is working with its current auditor, SRCO Professional Corporation, on the audit procedures required to complete the 2017 Annual Financial Filings and expects to be able to file the Annual Financial Filings within the next few weeks. The Company will provide updates as further information relating to the Annual Financial Filings becomes available.\nIf the Company files the 2017 Financial Disclosure within 90 days of the date of the CTO, the filing of the 2017 Financial Disclosure constitutes the application to revoke the CTO and no application fee is required under Appendix C of OSC Rule 13-502 — Fees to resume trading. Once the CTO is revoked, the Company will be subject to a reinstatement to trade review by the TSX Venture Exchange.\nThe Company expects to file the 2017 Financial Disclosure within 90 days of the date of the CTO.\nAbout Imex Systems\nImex Systems Inc. is a Canadian software products and solution provider to Governments, Municipalities and Public Authorities in Canada and internationally.
