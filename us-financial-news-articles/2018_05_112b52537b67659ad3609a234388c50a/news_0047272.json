Alberto Estevez/Pool via REUTERS The central government has been at loggerheads with Catalonia since the previous regional government set up an illegal popular vote on secession in October before a unilateral declaration of independence prompted Madrid to take control.\nPro-independence leaders in the wealthy region, which accounts for around a fifth of Spain’s total economic output, claim it unfairly pays too much into government coffers and have campaigned for the creation of a new republic.\nFILE PHOTO: Dismissed former Catalan Minister of Culture Lluis Puig Gordi, and regional Minister of Health Antoni Comin talk to the media after appearing in court in Brussels, Belgium, May 16, 2018.
