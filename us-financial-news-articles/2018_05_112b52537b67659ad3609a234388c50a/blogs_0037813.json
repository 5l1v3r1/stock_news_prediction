Photo: Bloomberg News\nThomas Toepfer is a finance chief in search of an acquisition target.\nThe chief financial officer of Covestro AG says the German chemicals maker’s low debt and rising cash positions make it an ideal time to scout for potential deals.\nThe company, spun off from Bayer AG in the fall of 2015, hasn’t struck an acquisition since its inception. “We need to become capable of doing mergers and acquisitions,” Mr. Toepfer said.\nMr. Toepfer says Covestro’s net debt — at 0.4 times earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization — is too low given the low financing costs available in the market. The global average of this leverage metric for the specialty chemicals industry is a higher multiple of 1.9 as of March, according to FactSet. Without an acquisition, the company expects its free cash flow will rise to €5 billion ($5.9 billion) within three years.\n“Over the long haul, this isn’t an efficient way of managing a balance sheet,” Mr. Toepfer said in an interview with CFO Journal. “If you are doing equity finance only, that’s very expensive,” he said.\nMr. Toepfer said the company needs to find a suitable acquisition target to justify increasing its leverage. Management “could imagine” raising Covestro’s net-debt to ebitda ratio to 1.5 times, taking advantage of relatively low financing costs in Europe, he said.\nThe CFO is searching for potential takeover targets, preferably in its coatings, adhesives and specialties segment, he added.\nCovestro already is a market leader in the polyurethanes and the polycarbonates business and expects to encounter antitrust issues, should it attempt a large transaction in either of the two segments.\nThis limits the company’s scope to bolt-on acquisitions, the CFO said. He declined to say how much the company will spend on an acquisition.\nThe company had €283 million in net debt on its books at the end of 2017, down more than 80% from €1.49 billion a year earlier. Its free cash flow–defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures–totalled €364 million in the first quarter, up 72.5% from the same period of 2017. Covestro expects it to grow significantly faster this year than its three-year average expansion pace.\nMr. Toepfer took over a well-managed finance and treasury function, said Michael Schaefer, an analyst at Commerzbank AG. “He does not have huge refinancing or other tasks awaiting him,” Mr. Schaefer said. “He will focus on steering Covestro’s capital allocation,” he added.\nCovestro is spending some of its excess cash on a €1.5 billion share buyback and higher dividends. The company’s current dividend yield is 2.8%, according to S&P Capital IQ.\nCovestro also pledged to invest €650 million in 2018 to ramp up capacity at its existing production sites. The management will decide on a new production site over the next 12 to 18 months, and that is expected to cost €1 billion to €2 billion, Mr. Toepfer said.\nShare this: DEBT MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS Previous CFO Moves: Houzz, MetLife, SEC Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Digital Transformation: Bringing the Risk and Compliance Function to the Table As digital technologies take on a larger role in the way organizations conduct their business, the compliance and internal audit functions should be proactive in joining the transformation.
