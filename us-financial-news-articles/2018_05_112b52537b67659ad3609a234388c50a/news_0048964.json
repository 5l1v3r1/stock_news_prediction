He wants to have his 10-team league up and running for 2019.\nCommisso’s half-billion dollar pledge comes with conditions, including a “10 year runway” which would allow for ownership of multiple franchises by a single investor and a promise by the federation not to impose regulatory roadblocks.\n“I have $250 million I am willing to put at risk as long as you don’t go out and destroy that investment by making arbitrary decisions after that investment has been made,” Commisso told Reuters. “I want to play in 2019.\n“I am willing to put a lot of money at risk to frankly give something back to soccer that doesn’t exist today, promotion and relegation, the way soccer should be played, in my opinion.\n“Let’s see what they do now. Here is a crazy guy that wants to put all kinds of money and see what they do now to keep me from playing.”\nWhile Commisso would accept a division two designation, his ultimate goal is to develop a league that can challenge Major League Soccer’s status as North America’s premier circuit.\nSecond division status, however, connotes a product that is second rate for many North American sports consumers, while promotion and relegation is as foreign a concept in the U.S. as socialized health care.\nSecuring sponsorship and a TV deal will be a challenge.\n“It is not a question of how we are going to be sanctioned,” said Commisso. “Over time our aspiration is to be competitive with the MLS.\n“What will ultimately make the league successful are the television and the sponsors’ money.\n“Ideally, I want to have promotion-relegation and set it up similar to the way it is in Europe because I feel that that is the way we are going to get a jolt to our system.” Editing by Ian Ransom", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:22:43.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
