Polls indicate a second round is likely to happen and would be held on July 8 if necessary.\nErdogan has won nearly a dozen elections and dominated Turkish politics since the Islamist-rooted AK party swept to power in 2002.\nFormer president Abdullah Gul, one of the founding members of the AKP, at the weekend said he would not be a candidate, ending weeks of speculation that he would run for the Saadet Party.\nThe election will mark Turkey’s transition into a presidency with new sweeping executive powers - opposed by the Saadet Party - in a narrowly approved referendum last year.\nEven though the two parties were born as a result of the same Islamist movement, Karamollaoglu has criticized the AKP’s handling of the economy and the crackdown under the state of emergency in place since the coup attempt in July 2016.\nSpeaking on Tuesday in front of a poster with his image alongside the words, “Wise president for Turkey”, Karamollaoglu focused on what he said was the lack of personal freedoms in Turkey.\n“The issue in this country is not a matter of rightist-leftist, in its essence. The issue in this country is not a matter of conservative or liberal either. The issue in this country is about the oppressors and the downtrodden.”\nReporting by Ali Kucukgocmen and Gulsen Solaker in Ankara; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T16:34:46.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
