Eleven people had died and dozens were missing from among Syrian government and allied forces.\n“Five blasts at least were heard inside Hama military airport ... targeting ammunition and fuel depots,” the Observatory added.\nThe war monitor said it wasn’t clear whether the blasts had been caused by technical failure inside the depots or an attack. Thick plumes of smoke could be seen above the airport, it said.\nReporting by Dahlia Nehme; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:54:51.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
