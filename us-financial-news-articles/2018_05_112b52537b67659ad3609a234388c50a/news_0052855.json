REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa\nIsrael’s military confirmed the strike, saying it targeted an observation post in response to a bomb that had been placed next to the border fence overnight. Video issued on the military’s Twitter feed showed the bomb being detonated safely.\nIslamic Jihad operates with a measure of independence from Hamas, the Islamist group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 and fought three wars against Israel.\nHostilities over the frontier have soared since Palestinians began mass-demonstrations on March 30, which Israel deems to be cover for attempts to breach the border fence.\nAt least 115 Palestinians have been killed and thousands hurt by army gunfire in the protests, drawing foreign censure.

REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa\nOrganisers said they would ramp up demonstrations on Tuesday with a flotilla of boats that would set off from Gaza in an attempt to break Israel’s maritime blockade of the enclave.\n“Gaza has become a big, isolated prison, deprived of minimal rights, because of the unjust Israeli siege,” they said in a statement, referring to clampdowns by Israel and neighbour Egypt.\nIsrael has blunted the military capabilities of Hama with a series of counter-measures: the Iron Dome air defence system against short-range rockets and a system for detecting and destroying cross-border guerrilla tunnels.

Hundreds attended his funeral in Jerusalem on Sunday.
