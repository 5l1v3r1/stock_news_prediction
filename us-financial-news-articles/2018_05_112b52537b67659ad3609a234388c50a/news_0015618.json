I’m telling the truth,” Giuliani said. But Trump has also promised to weigh his lawyers’ advice.\nIn a tweet on Monday, Trump made clear his displeasure with the prosecutors running the Russia probe, describing them as “13 Angry Democrats.” He went on to suggest he might raise an issue with the courts about “unrevealed conflicts of interest” inside the Mueller team. The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2018\nMueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential race. He is also examining whether Trump obstructed justice in firing FBI Director James Comey a year ago. Trump has denied any collusion or obstruction, while Russia has denied interfering in the election.
