Such volatility in net cross-border flows is not uncommon at this time of year and net outflows look to have remained well within regulators’ comfort zone,” he said in a note.\nThe dollar index, measuring it against other major currencies, rose 2 percent last month.\nCapital flight was seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the Chinese economy.\nLast year, China’s reserves rose for the first time since 2014 and its cross-border capital flows went from net outflows to basically stable.\nTrade disputes between China and the United States could hurt exporters on both sides and weigh on their economic growth, while adding to volatility in global financial markets.\nBut China’s foreign exchange regulator said in April that any potential impact on its cross-border capital flows stemming from Sino-U.S. trade frictions can be controlled.\nCOURTING CAPITAL INFLOWS The yuan lost around 1 percent against the resurgent greenback in April, but it is still up about 2.5 percent so far this year.\nIndeed, in recent weeks, Chinese authorities have announced a series of moves which suggest they are less worried about capital outflows, including allowing domestic investors to put more money into global financial markets.\nAt the same time, China has moved to give foreign investors more access to its equity, bond and commodity futures markets, which will help support the yuan and offer greater balance to cross-border flows.\nThe value of China’s gold reserves fell to $77.788 billion at the end of April, from $78.419 billion at the end of March.\nEditing by Jacqueline Wong and Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T20:17:26.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
