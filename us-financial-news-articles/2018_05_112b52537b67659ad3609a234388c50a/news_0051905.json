They are supported in parliament by the Left Party. Together, the parties polled 37 percent.\nThe Moderates, Centre, Christian Democrats and Liberals cooperate and will fight the election as a group. They polled 39 percent.\nNeither bloc can form a majority government without the Sweden Democrats and both have ruled out a deal with the party, which has its roots in the neo-Nazi fringe.\nThe general election will be held on Sept. 9.
