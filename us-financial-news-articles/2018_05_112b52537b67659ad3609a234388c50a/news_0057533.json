It gave no other details.\nIn an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trudeau said the investigation was based on flimsy logic and was part of pressure from Washington to renegotiate the NAFTA trade pact.\nMexico’s economy minister said on Friday there was about a 40 percent chance of concluding the NAFTA talks before Mexico’s presidential election on July 1.
