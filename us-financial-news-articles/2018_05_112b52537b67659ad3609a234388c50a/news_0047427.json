(NASDAQ:PLAB), a worldwide leader in supplying innovative imaging technology solutions for the global electronics industry, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended April 29, 2018.\nSecond quarter revenue was $130.8 million, increases of 6% sequentially and 21% compared with the same quarter prior year. Integrated circuit (IC) revenue was $102.3 million, up 7% sequentially and 24% compared with last year. Flat panel display (FPD) revenue was $28.5 million, up 3% sequentially and 11% compared with last year.\nNet income attributable to Photronics, Inc. shareholders was $10.7 million ($0.15 per diluted share), compared with $5.9 million ($0.09 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2018 and $1.8 million ($0.03 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2017.\n\"Performance strengthened again in the second quarter, continuing the sequential revenue growth of the past four quarters,” said Peter Kirlin, chief executive officer. “High-end IC was especially strong year-over-year, up 83%. Sequentially, IC continued to improve in both logic and memory, as customers, particularly Asia foundries, released new designs. High-end FPD was down slightly on soft AMOLED demand, but mainstream improved due to growth in LTPS LCD displays. Operating margin improved with the growth in revenue, although tempered slightly by higher operating expenses. Minority interest increased due to strong earnings from our Taiwan JV, and a foreign exchange gain contributed to the bottom line, resulting in net income of $10.7 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $321 million, which will be very important as we anticipate a ramp of capital expenditures later this year for our new facilities in China.”\nThird Quarter 2018 Guidance\nFor the third quarter of 2018, Photronics expects revenue to be between $128 million and $136 million, and net income attributable to Photronics, Inc. shareholders to be between $0.12 and $0.18 per diluted share.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss these results is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, May 22, 2018.
