It is responsible for more than a third of Chile’s copper production.\nA conservative billionaire who took office in March, Pinera has promised stable financing, improved management and efficiency at Codelco.\nUnder center-left President Michelle Bachelet, Codelco advanced a mine project in Ecuador and eyed investments as far off as Mongolia. But slumping copper prices until mid-2017 complicated financing at home and abroad.\nCurrent CEO Nelson Pizarro and outgoing board Chair Oscar Landerretche, both appointed by Bachelet, together spearheaded a belt-tightening program at Codelco that has allowed the company to maintain productivity despite a 9 percent drop in ore grades since 2013.\nIt is still unclear whether Pizarro will keep his job or whether the new board will pick a fresh face.\nPinera earlier this month appointed former mining minister Hernan de Solminihac and Ignacio Briones, a professor at Adolfo Ibanez University, to Codelco’s board.
