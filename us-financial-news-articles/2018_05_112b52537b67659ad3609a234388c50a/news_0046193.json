MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday the U.S. trade war with China was \"on hold\". \"Given the possible worst-case scenario was avoided the market should view the latest trade discussions as favourable and equity market should be in that happy place, at least for today,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at Oanda. Singapore gained as much as 1.1 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain in three weeks, with lenders DBS Group Holdings and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp up as much as 1.8 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. The city-state is set to release its final gross domestic product for the first quarter on Thursday, with expectations that the economy will expand on the back of growth in the manufacturing sector. Thai shares gained for a third session, buoyed by gains in financials and energy stocks. Convenience store operator CP All PCL was up as much as 1.8 percent, while PTT Exploration and Production gained as much as 2.1 percent. Thailand's economy grew nearly twice as fast as forecast from the previous quarter in January-March, driven by robust exports and tourism as well as improved private consumption and crops, data showed. Meanwhile, Indonesian shares slipped for a third straight session, down as much as 1.1 percent, to their lowest in nearly two weeks. Bank Indonesia said it would conduct three foreign exchange swap operations this week to ensure enough rupiah liquidity in the market following its benchmark interest rate hike last week. \"As the U.S. continuously raises interest rates, it's impacting a lot of the emerging markets, such as Indonesia. Hence, the central bank has to raise interest rates to stamp out the capital outflows,\" said Joel Ng, analyst at KGI Securities. The rupiah hit its lowest in more than two-and-a-half years in early trade. Telekomunikasi Indonesia shed 2.3 percent, while lender Bank Rakyat Indonesia was down as much as 6.5 percent.
