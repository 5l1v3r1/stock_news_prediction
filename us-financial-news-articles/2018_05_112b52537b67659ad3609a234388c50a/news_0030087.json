It says the crackdown is needed for security reasons. “POLITICAL IDIOTS BUT FOOTBALL GENIUSES”\nThe pictures also drew criticism from German lawmakers from both left and right. Veteran Greens lawmaker Cem Ozdemir, with Turkish roots, described them as tasteless and embarrassing. Slideshow (2 Images)\n“Posing with the Turkish president is not exemplary behaviour and is not appropriate for German national players,” said Social Democrat deputy leader Ralf Stegner.\nA commentary in top-selling Bild, which ran the photos on its front page, said: “If you have a moral position, you don’t laugh into the camera with Erdogan. The main question is whether the two German national players still fit into our German team. I say yes. They are political idiots. But football geniuses.”\nGermany coach Joachim Loew names his provisional squad for the World Cup in Russia later on Tuesday.\nGundogan later said he had not meant to make a political statement or get involved in an election campaign.\nTurkey holds presidential and parliamentary elections on June 24, after which a new constitutional system comes into force which hands the president much greater powers than before.\nTFF Turkish Football Federation Vice President Servet Yardimci, a UEFA Executive Committee member, said Erdogan liked meeting soccer players but that Ozil and Gundogan were not part of the election campaign.\n“We have to be fair, there is no intention whatsoever to get them involved,” he told a briefing in London on Monday. “They are Turkish but are playing for German national team and I don’t think it’s fair to involve them.” Reporting by Madeline Chambers; Additional reporting by Martyn Herman in London; Editing by Gareth Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:55:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
