Schall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx. “A major goal is on the near horizon: the completion of patient enrollment in our global Phase III ADVOCATE pivotal trial of avacopan for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, while a second trial of avacopan in the orphan kidney disease of C3G is well underway. Standing also on the threshold of a new value-creating era, we intend to expand avacopan’s scope into orphan dermatological disease with the launch of clinical trials in HS in 2018. Advances continue with our CCR2 inhibitor CCX140, with trials launched in primary FSGS, a devastating disease with no approved therapies. With such progress continuing, we are laying the foundation for commercialization of these novel therapies in the U.S. in order to bring the benefits of our precision medicines to those enduring these serious diseases.”\nRecent Highlights\nPatient enrollment in ChemoCentryx's Phase III ADVOCATE pivotal trial of avacopan for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis is nearing completion with over 85% of the 300 patient target enrolled to date. The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of avacopan following 52 weeks of treatment. The ADVOCATE trial is designed to show the effect of avacopan on improving active vasculitis, as well as testing durable clinical benefit, which is one of the major limitations of the current standard of care. The Company’s CMA application for avacopan for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis is currently under review by the EMA.\nChemoCentryx has reached approximately 30% of the patient enrollment target in its clinical trial evaluating avacopan for C3G. C3G is a rare disorder that often affects the young, requiring dialysis and often kidney transplant with relapsing disease common. There is no approved effective treatment.\nIn 2018, ChemoCentryx plans to launch clinical trials of avacopan in HS, an inflammatory and chronic skin disease characterized by recurrent, painful, boil-like nodules under the skin.\nThe Company's CCR2 inhibitor CCX140 is currently being studied in two sub-populations of primary FSGS, an orphan kidney disease with no approved treatment option. One trial involves sub-nephrotic primary FSGS patients, whose disease cause is idiopathic; and the other trial is for primary FSGS patients with nephrotic syndrome, where reduction in proteinuria may constitute the registration endpoint. Further support of CCR2’s role in FSGS is highlighted in the peer reviewed findings published in March in the journal PLOS-ONE .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $177.1 million at March 31, 2018.\nRevenue was $9.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2017. Revenue recognized represents amortization of the upfront license fee commitments, milestone payments and collaboration funding from Vifor pursuant to the Avacopan Agreement, Avacopan Amendment and CCX140 Agreement. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective January 1, 2018.\nResearch and development expenses were $14.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to continued patient enrollment of the avacopan Phase III ADVOCATE pivotal trial in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and start-up expenses related to the CCX140 and avacopan Phase II clinical trials in patients with FSGS and C3G, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses partially offset by a decrease in professional legal fees.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.4 million, compared to $6.0 million for the same period in 2017.\nTotal shares outstanding at March 31, 2018 were approximately 49.1 million shares.\nThe Company expects to utilize cash and investments between $65 million and $75 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, May 9, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time / 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

ChemoCentryx targets the chemokine and chemoattractant systems to discover, develop and commercialize orally-administered therapies. ChemoCentryx is currently focusing on its late stage drug candidates for patients with rare diseases, avacopan (CCX168) and CCX140.\nAvacopan is an orally-administered small molecule that is a selective inhibitor of the complement C5a receptor, or C5aR. Avacopan is in Phase III development for the treatment of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated Vasculitis). In clinical studies to date, avacopan was shown to be safe, well tolerated and provided effective control of the disease while allowing elimination of high-dose steroids, part of the current standard of care. ChemoCentryx is also developing avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted avacopan orphan-drug designation for ANCA-associated Vasculitis, C3G and aHUS. The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation for avacopan for the treatment of two forms of ANCA-associated Vasculitis: microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), as well as for C3G. Avacopan was also granted access to the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) initiative, which supports accelerated assessment of investigational therapies addressing unmet medical need.\nThe Company's other late stage drug candidate is CCX140, an inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2, which is currently being developed for patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a debilitating kidney disease.\nChemoCentryx's Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor Pharma provides Vifor Pharma with exclusive rights to commercialize avacopan and CCX140 in markets outside of the U.S. and China.\nChemoCentryx also has early stage drug candidates that target chemoattractant receptors in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and in cancer.\nForward-Looking Statements\nChemoCentryx cautions that statements included in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements.
