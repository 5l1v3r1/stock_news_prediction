The crew of the aircraft had radioed ahead for the assistance, the airline said, before it landed at Dallas Love Field.\nSouthwest also told CBS News that the aircraft did not actually lose pressure, saying that the incident was “related to an aircraft duct that resulted in the oxygen masks deploying.”\nThe incident is not the only safety-related issue the airline has experienced recently. Last month, a woman was killed when an engine exploded during flight, making it the first airline fatality in the U.S. since 2009. Another Southwest flight diverted weeks later when a window cracked .\nThe aircraft in the Dallas incident “underwent a maintenance review,” Southwest said.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southwest-flight-861-emergency-landing-dallas-cabin-pressure/", "http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/05/13/southwest-flight-emergency-landing-dallas-losing-pressure/"], "published": "2018-05-14T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T22:30:53.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
