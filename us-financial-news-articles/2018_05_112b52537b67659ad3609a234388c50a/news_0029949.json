Still, recent gains have been smaller than before, consistent with slower sales, particularly outside of the condo sector.\nFurther softening of Canada’s once-hot housing market is expected as home buyers react to the three interest rate hikes taken by the Bank of Canada since July, but the condo market in both Toronto and Vancouver has remained robust.
