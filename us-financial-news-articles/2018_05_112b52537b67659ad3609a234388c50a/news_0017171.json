The office of Financial Empowerment will be renamed the office of Community Affairs, for one.\nMulvaney said he will also pick a political appointee to monitor the work of the agency’s top lawyer, the memo said.\nU.S. consumers are squeezed by a record $1.38 trillion in student debt, a total that has grown by about 40 percent in the last five years, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve.\nIn recent months, Mulvaney has dropped cases against certain payday lenders and asked financial services companies what changes they would most like to see in the CFPB.\nMulvaney has also said he may shut the agency’s open database for complaints that has served as a public forum for consumers.
