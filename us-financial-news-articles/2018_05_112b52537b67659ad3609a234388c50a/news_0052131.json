It wants to expand abroad, notably in high-growth markets such as China, and has been looking for partners to help with this expansion.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 6.7 percent to 169.8 million euros ($199.35 million) in the six months to March 31.\nThe companyâ€™s fiscal year runs from October to September.\nThe ski business, which makes the bulk of group sales, suffered during the first two weeks of April due to a late school holiday calendar and a transport strike in France but went on to recover somewhat for the end of the ski season.\nAs a result, the group expects growth in sales for the ski division to be slightly higher than 2 percent for full year 2017/18.\nFigures for 2016/17 were restated to notably reflect the reclassification of the Grevin Prague and Grevin Seoul museums as discontinued businesses.\n$1 = 0.8518 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon, Editing by Ingrid Melander\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:13:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
