It is the country's first movie theater since they were banned 37 years ago.\nAron said the cinema has been \"jam-packed\" since opening night, when the first show sold out in fewer than 15 minutes. But he said that's only because \"people didn't know how to buy our tickets. The next day we sold out in 45 seconds.\"\nWith the growing demand for movies in Saudi Arabia, Aron said AMC was going to add \"a lot\" of theaters in the country over the next three to five years.\nIn April, Aron told CNBC that AMC plans to open up to 40 cinemas in 15 cities around Saudi Arabia. By 2030, the country will have a total of 50-100 cinemas in approximately 25 cities.\nThe CEO said once the plan is carried out AMC will have 50 percent market share in Saudi Arabia. Business in the country will account for 5 to 10 percent of AMC's revenue and profit generation.\n\"AMC is booming at the moment,\" Aron said on Thursday, with customers hitting the box office in record numbers recently.\n\"We've been setting record after record after record,\" he said. \"Since September of 2017, we've been roaring hot.\"\nHe anticipates May will be one of the biggest months in movie history, with releases such as the new \"Star Wars\" movie, \"Solo,\" opening on Friday and other anticipated films coming.\n\"We've got big movies that have had people flock to our theaters recently,\" Aron said. \"And we've got big movies over the next two months.\" WATCH: 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' hits theaters show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T23:03:54.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
