And we think that that's going to be the future. The U.S. for the next 15-20 years looks very promising.\"\nGarrett added that President Donald Trump's tax cuts \"have not been bad for business.\"\nBorealis, Total and NOVA Chemicals formed a joint venture to boost petrochemicals facilities in Texas earlier this year.\nThe U.S. shale market has grown in recent years following the advent of drilling techniques including fracking, or hydraulic fracturing. The growth of natural gas production and exports in the U.S. comes at a time when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) — a collective of the world's biggest oil exporters — and Russia are cutting supply.\nNo impact from US' Iran deal exit Oil prices rose last week after Trump said he would withdraw from a historic nuclear deal with Iran.\nshow chapters Borealis CEO: Restored Iran sanctions have not had impact so far 7 Hours Ago | 01:21 Trump said the U.S. administration would restore sanctions on Iran. The deal, achieved in 2015 under former President Barack Obama, lifted sanctions on Iran that had cut its oil exports roughly in half. In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran accepted limits on its nuclear program and allowed international inspectors to visit its facilities.\nAsked whether he was concerned about Trump's move, Garrett told CNBC: \"Well, for us at the moment we don't have a specific impact. It's much more that we have to watch these global movements and then you have impacts because the oil price starts to move up, the cost of products starts to change and things like that.\"\nHe added: \"Actual supply chains are immune at the moment to these problems.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T14:02:28.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
