(NASDAQ: CFFN) (the \"Company\") announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a True Blue Capitol dividend of $0.25 per share on outstanding CFFN common stock. The cash dividend will be paid on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2018. The True Blue Capitol dividend is the result of the Board of Directors' continued commitment to return value to our stockholders.\nThe Board of Directors of Capitol Federal Savings Bank (the \"Bank\") also announced today that it has voted to make a capital distribution to CFFN in the amount of $36.0 million, which will be paid prior to June 30, 2018. This additional capital distribution will allow CFFN to pay the $0.25 per share True Blue Capitol dividend.\nFor fiscal year 2018, it is the intent of the Board of Directors and management to continue the payout of 100% of the Company's earnings to its stockholders. The payout is expected to be in the form of regular quarterly cash dividends and a cash true-up dividend equal to fiscal year 2018 earnings in excess of the amount paid as regular quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2018. It is anticipated that the fiscal year 2018 cash true-up dividend will be paid in December 2018. Dividend payments depend upon a number of factors including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, regulatory limitations on the Bank's ability to make capital distributions to the Company, and the amount of cash at the holding company.\nCapitol Federal Financial, Inc. is the holding company for the Bank. The Bank has 47 branch locations in Kansas and Missouri, and is one of the largest residential lenders in the State of Kansas.
