REUTERS/Nigel Marple/File Photo The fall in production came despite an improvement in weather conditions.\nIn March, Fonterra said its New Zealand milk collection fell 3 percent to 143 million kilograms of milk solids.\nMilk collection in its smaller Australian operations jumped 26 percent to 11 million kilograms of milk solids from March last season due to favorable conditions, the dairy exporter said in a statement.\nMarch’s production figures could affect New Zealand’s fortnightly milk auction, due to take place at midnight local time.\nIn the last auction on April 18, prices snapped four straight falls, hinting at ramped up global demand and further price rises.\nReporting by Devika Syamnath in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:08:59.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
