He fled Russia after he received threats for saying he did not mourn the victims of a Russian defence ministry plane crash in 2016.\nUkrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said in a social media posting late on Tuesday he was convinced that what he called “the Russian totalitarian machine” had not forgiven Babchenko for what Groysman called his honesty, a charge the Russian foreign minister rejected on Wednesday.
