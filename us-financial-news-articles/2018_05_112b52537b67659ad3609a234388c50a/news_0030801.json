Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) and segment Adjusted EBITDA are the financial metrics by which management and the chief operating decision maker allocate resources of the Company and analyze the performance of the Company as a whole and each of our reportable segments, respectively. Management also uses this measure to determine the contribution of our core operations to the funding of our corporate resources utilized to manage our operations and our non-operating expenses including debt service and acquisitions. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining our compliance with certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.\nIn deriving this measure, the Company excludes from Adjusted EBITDA items not related to core operations and those that are non-cash including: depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gain or loss on the exchange, sale, or disposal of any assets or stations, early extinguishment of debt, local marketing agreement fees (as such fees are excluded from the definition of such term for purposes of calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement), expenses relating to acquisitions, restructuring costs, reorganization items and non-cash impairments of assets, if any.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA, although not a measure that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, is commonly employed by the investment community as a measure for determining the market value of a media company and comparing the operational and financial performance among media companies. Management has also observed that Adjusted EBITDA is routinely utilized to evaluate and negotiate the potential purchase price for media companies. Given the relevance to our overall value, management believes that investors consider the metric to be extremely useful.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company’s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined or calculated differently by other companies, and comparability may be limited.\nThe following tables reconcile net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Radio Station Group Westwood One Corporate and Other Consolidated GAAP net income (loss) $ 28,808 $ 5,822 $ (39,631 ) $ (5,001 ) Income tax benefit — — (118 ) (118 ) Non-operating (income) expense, including net interest expense (1 ) 127 (30 ) 96 Local marketing agreement fees 1,107 — — 1,107 Depreciation and amortization 6,141 5,478 362 11,981 Stock-based compensation expense — — 166 166 Loss on sale or disposal of assets or stations 11 — — 11 Reorganization items, net — 181 29,986 30,167 Acquisition-related and restructuring costs 120 1,048 553 1,721 Franchise and state taxes — — 139 139 Adjusted EBITDA $ 36,186 $ 12,656 $ (8,573 ) $ 40,269\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 Radio Station Group Westwood One Corporate and Other Consolidated GAAP net income (loss) $ 28,538 $ 2,265 $ (38,198 ) $ (7,395 ) Income tax benefit — — (6,026 ) (6,026 ) Non-operating (income) expense, including net interest expense (1 ) 142 33,802 33,943 Local marketing agreement fees 2,707 — — 2,707 Depreciation and amortization 10,404 5,454 424 16,282 Stock-based compensation expense — — 538 538 Gain on sale or disposal of assets or stations (2,606 ) — — (2,606 ) Acquisition-related and restructuring costs — 1,108 42 1,150 Franchise and state taxes — — 140 140 Adjusted EBITDA $ 39,042 $ 8,969 $ (9,278 ) $ 38,733\nSource: Cumulus Media Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Gl_Hh8SN81l8dsDGOpnp5eVHPn2csuC5rER8u-WpzIObO6ixbhAcjru4JmVRZ5YV7IzXoaf11JswL5Nht01V0Q58c6WgTWLrk9TSfy8LzpM=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2ee19a47-ecf9-4d59-a531-b9108a3b1711"], "published": "2018-05-15T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T17:03:45.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
