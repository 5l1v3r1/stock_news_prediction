REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo\nFox, which agreed to sell the bulk of its film and TV assets to Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) last year in a $52.4 billion deal, expects to ask for shareholder approval of the transaction this summer, Lachlan Murdoch, executive chair, said on an analyst call.\nMurdoch declined to comment on reports that Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) is preparing an all-cash rival offer for the assets, which Reuters first reported Monday\nFox expects to receive UK regulatory approval on its bid to buy the remaining stake it does not already own of European pay-TV provider ( SKYB.L ) in the next couple of months, James Murdoch, chief executive officer of Twenty-First Century Fox, said on the call. Comcast this week notified regulators of its plans to bid for Sky.\n“Given Comcast’s bid for Sky, we are considering our options,” James Murdoch said, adding that the company would make an announcement in “due course.”\nRevenue from Fox’s cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 9.8 percent to $4.42 billion, accounting for more than half of total revenue in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31.\nThat beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nDespite the departure of former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly amid sexual misconduct allegations last spring, prime-time ratings of Fox News have held up when looking at April compared to the year-ago period, Lachlan Murdoch said.\n“That’s a real testament to the strength of the brand and obviously the strength of the talent on air,” he said.\nThe company reported revenue of $3.51 billion in affiliate fees, a rise of 11 percent from a year earlier.\nRevenue at its television unit, which houses Fox Broadcasting, was $1.15 billion, down 32 percent from the year-ago quarter, which included the Super Bowl, and missed analysts’ estimate of $1.28 billion.\nTotal revenue fell 2 percent to $7.42 billion, but beat estimates of $7.4 billion.\nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $858 million, or 46 cents per share, from $799 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Fox earned 49 cents per share, missing analysts’ estimate of 53 cents per share.\nFox shares were flat in after-hours trading.
