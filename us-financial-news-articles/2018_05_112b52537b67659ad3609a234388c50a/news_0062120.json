That would suggest about 70 billion yen ($644.45 million) based on its latest disclosure, which puts its holdings of foreign bonds at 7 trillion yen.\n“We thought Italian political risks were underestimated when the two-year Italian yield was so close to the German yields ahead of the election,” Tachibana said.\nThe two-year Italian debt yield was around minus 0.10-0.20 percent, compared to minus 0.60 percent, just before the inconclusive election.\nIt spiked to almost three percent on Tuesday, making the biggest one-day rise since 1992, after the two anti-establishment parties clashed with the country’s president who rejected their choice of an eurosceptic economist as finance minister.
