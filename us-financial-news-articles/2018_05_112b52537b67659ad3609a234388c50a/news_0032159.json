The buildings offer unobstructed views of the Rocky Mountains and notable sites in LoDo including Union Station and Coors Field and offer the best parking ratio in the LoDo submarket.\nLoDo Towers is in the hub of downtown Denver, ideally situated in the LoDo submarket, just minutes from Union Station, the area’s epicenter, and steps from the bustling 16 th Street Mall, a pedestrian shopping, dining and entertainment area, which offers the free MallRide service. The property is also located just a few blocks from historic Larimer Square, with its eclectic collection of shops and eateries. In addition, tenants have easy access to the free MetroRide downtown circulator that allows them to reach many downtown amenities. The property also offers convenient access to Interstate 25, given the location just three blocks from Union Station, access to light rail, bus and commuter rail services.\nCIM brings its wealth of experience in managing and repositioning commercial properties in urban markets to this significant asset in downtown Denver. CIM assesses properties within the context of the greater community to ensure that each asset makes a positive contribution to the area.\nCIM has been actively involved in Denver since 2015 when it acquired the former University of Colorado Health Sciences Center with Continuum Partners to co-develop the 26-acre site into 9 th & Colorado, an urban infill mixed-use project. Recently the first retail tenants were announced, including a 10-screen AMC Theatres® that will anchor one of the 12-blocks of the project. Earlier this month, Theo, the first residential component of 9 th & Colorado, welcomed its first residents to the 275-unit, nine-story apartment building. A second residential building of 319 units is currently under construction.
