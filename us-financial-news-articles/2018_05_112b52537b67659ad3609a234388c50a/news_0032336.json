People were determined to address the situation.”\nRecapitalised three times since a debt crisis exploded in 2010, Greek banks are still burdened by 96 billion euros of sour debt. They have committed to targets to reduce that load to 65 billion euros by 2019.\n“Addressing NPLs will take time, the commitment is ambitious but attainable,” the source said. “We need to see a number of parameters go back to normal - deposits coming back, confidence returning and moving forward on (lifting) capital controls.”\nAsked if Greek banks should be thinking of strengthening their equity capital, following in the footsteps of Italy’s Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ), which pulled off a record 13 billion euro share sale last year to fund bad loan disposals, the source said such decisions are taken by banks and not supervisors.\n“I expect sooner or later there will be a number of banks that will do what Unicredit did. Its new CEO and his team decided enough was enough ... and wanted to become a premium bank.”\nUniCredit hired former Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) investment banking boss Jean Pierre Mustier in 2016 to tackle long-standing concerns over a weak balance sheet. The French banker sold assets and shut branches.\n“This is also a possibility for Greek banks, not to just keep your head above water but to do much more than what regulators are asking.”\n($1 = 0.8386 euros)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:39:11.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
