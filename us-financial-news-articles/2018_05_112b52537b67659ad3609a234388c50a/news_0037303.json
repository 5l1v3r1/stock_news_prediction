(NASDAQ: IMMY) today reported financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nNotable Highlights:\nRevenue of $8.9 million, up 45% year-over-year Gross ophthalmology-related revenue of $7.0 million, up 91% year-over-year Gross Margin of 54%, compared to 45% in Q1 2017 Adjusted EBITDA loss (a non-GAAP measure) of $431,000, an 85% improvement year-over-year, and 46% improvement quarter-over-quarter First month of Adjusted EBITDA profitability in March 16 straight quarters of double digit or better year-over-year revenue growth Eton Pharmaceuticals filed its first new drug application (NDA) with the US Food and Drug Administration, advanced programs that are expected to result in additional NDA filings over the next 12 months, and increased active drug development programs from four to eight Surface Pharmaceuticals announced a $20 million Series A financing at $3.30 per share with Flying L Partners, a premier ophthalmology-focused investor with a strong track record of success\nMark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis, stated, \"Because of our unique value proposition, the infrastructure we've built, the drug formulation intellectual property portfolio we own, and a growing loyal customer base, we are seeing increased momentum towards reaching our financial goals. This is evidenced by a quarterly revenue increase that was our largest year-over-year percentage gain since the fourth quarter of 2016. Importantly, we continued to narrow our Adjusted EBITDA loss, roughly halving it again sequentially; and we had a profitable March, which was followed by an even better April. Four full years into our commercial operations, with a compound annual growth rate of 153%, I remain bullish on the business and our ability to navigate through challenges and deliver on our goals for the foreseeable future.\"\nCommenting on Imprimis's strategy to develop certain of its drug formulation assets as FDA approved products, Baum concluded, \"In addition to seeing great progress with our first deconsolidated company, Eton Pharmaceuticals, we are also gratified by the $20 million financing and deconsolidation we recently completed for Surface Pharmaceuticals. In addition to the investment, our partner in the transaction, Flying L Partners, contributes decades of tremendous accomplishment in ophthalmology, which will add intrinsic value to Surface. With the completion of the Surface financing and deconsolidation, Imprimis is now focusing on concluding work we have been undertaking on other 505(b)(2) opportunities from our drug formulation library, which we hope to discuss more in the future.\"\nImprimis Pharmaceuticals has retained ownership of 3.5 million shares of Eton Pharmaceuticals common stock and 3.5 million shares of Surface Pharmaceuticals common stock. In addition, Imprimis owns mid-single digit royalty rights on all contributed drugs. Imprimis retains royalty rights on two patent-pending sterile injectable drug candidates contributed to Eton, one targeting infantile spasms and the other targeting Peyronie's Disease. Imprimis retains royalty rights on three patent-pending drug candidates contributed to Surface, two are topical eye drop drug candidates, the third is an oral capsule, all of which target certain ocular surface diseases.\nFinancial Summary:\nSelected highlights regarding operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and for the same period in 2017 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the three months\nended March 31, 2018\nFor the three months\nended March 31, 2017\nTotal Revenues\n$8,865\n$6,097\nCost of Sales\n(4,071)\n(3,357)\nGross Profit\n4,794\n2,740\nSelling, General & Administrative Expenses\n(6,488)\n(6,811)\nResearch & Development Expenses\n(87)\n(160)\nOperating Loss\n(1,781)\n(4,231)\nOther Expense, net\n(1,732)\n(775)\nNet Loss\n$(3,513)\n$ (5,006)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to the company's results of operations determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are presented and discussed above, management also utilizes adjusted EBITDA, an unaudited financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the company's financial results and performance and to plan and forecast future periods. Adjusted EBITDA is considered a \"non-GAAP\" financial measure within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the SEC. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting its business. Management believes adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the company's performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making; (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the company's core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the company's core operating performance; and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the company's results. However, adjusted EBITDA and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the company's competitors.\nThe company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding the effects of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, other income (expense) and, if any and when specified, other non-recurring income or expense items. The company believes that the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net loss. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit or net loss as a measure of operating performance or to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of ability to meet cash needs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nGAAP Net Loss\n$(3,513)\n$(5,006)\nStock-based compensation and payments\n815\n950\nInterest expense, net\n663\n788\nTaxes\n-\n(28)\nDepreciation\n399\n345\nAmortization of intangible assets\n60\n90\nOther expenses/loss (1)\n-\n15\nInvestment loss from Eton Pharmaceuticals\n1,069\n-\nNon-recurring expenses (2)\n76\n-\nAdjusted E(L)BITDA\n$ (431)\n$(2,846)\n(1)\nRepresents the loss on the sale of ImprimisRx TX assets.\n(2)\nNon-recurring expenses are costs Surface incurred during the period presented that were consolidated in the Company's financials, and subsequently will be reimbursed to the Company following the deconsolidation of Surface in the second quarter of 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe company's management team will host a conference call and audio-only webcast today at 4:30 p.m. EDT (1:30 p.m. PDT) to discuss the financial results and recent developments.
