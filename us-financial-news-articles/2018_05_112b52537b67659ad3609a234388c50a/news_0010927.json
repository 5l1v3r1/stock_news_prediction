More importantly, perhaps, will be the change in average hourly earnings, often considered a predecessor of inflation.\nExpectations for the report include the addition of 195,000 non-farm jobs added and a month-over-month change in average hourly earnings of 0.2 percent, according to economists polled by Reuters.\nThe uptick in so-called safe havens like Treasurys and gold prices likely came, in part, due to an announcement by Iran's foreign minister on Thursday, sparking geopolitical tensions.\nMohammad Javad Zarif said that the country will not renegotiate nor ratify any modification to the existing nuclear deal it struck with the U.S. and other world powers as the deadline set by President Donald Trump for European to \"fix\" the deal loomed.\nThe announcement comes just days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed a cache of files he claims were obtained from Iran and prove the country ran a secret program to build nuclear weapons.\nTrump will decide by May 12 whether to renew sanctions waivers on Iran.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T13:36:40.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
