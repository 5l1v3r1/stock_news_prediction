For example, he insisted, despite evidence to the contrary, that the crowd at his January 2017 inauguration was bigger than at predecessor Barack Obama’s.\nMore recently, Trump at first disputed that he was aware of a $130,000 payment made by his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleges an affair with Trump.\nBut another Trump attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, then said Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payment. In an ethics disclosure on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged repaying Cohen more than $100,000 for an undisclosed purpose.\nIn his speech, Tillerson said a commitment to facts cements U.S. alliances with other democracies worldwide.\n“It is also that foundational commitment to truth and facts that binds us to other like-minded democratic nations - that we Americans will always deal with them from the same set of truths and facts,” he said. “And it is truth that says to our adversaries, we say what we mean, and we mean what we say.”\nOutgoing U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson waves to applauding workers after delivering his parting remarks at the State Department in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2018.
