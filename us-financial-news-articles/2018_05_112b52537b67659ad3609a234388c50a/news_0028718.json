Overall, the group carried 8.2 million passengers, down 2.5 percent from a year ago.\nJean-Marc Janaillac said last Friday that he was resigning as CEO after staff rejected a pay deal that he had put to a vote after talks with the unions reached a deadlock.\nAir France-KLM’s board is due to meet next week to appoint an interim transition team to succeed Janaillac, who lasted less than two years in the job.
