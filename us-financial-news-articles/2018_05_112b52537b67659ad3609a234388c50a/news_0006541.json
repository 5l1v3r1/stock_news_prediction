REUTERS/ Mike Blake/File Photo\nThe company said revenue from its high-margin digital business, rose 13 percent to $1.21 billion (0.89 billion pounds).\nThe video-game publisher, which is behind popular franchises such as “Destiny” and “Skylanders”, forecast 2018 adjusted profit of $2.51 per share and revenue of $7.48 billion.\nAnalysts were expecting a profit of $2.61 per share and revenue of $7.51 billion.\nFor the current quarter, the company forecast adjusted revenue of $1.35 billion and profit of 31 cents per share. However, it missed the analysts’ average estimate of $1.49 billion and 47 cents per share.\nThe success of games from the “battle royale” genre such as Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has somewhat challenged publishers such as Activision and Take Two Interactive Software Inc.\nActivision shares have lost nearly 13 percent of their value since March 9, wiping off nearly $7.5 billion from its market cap.\nThe company’s profit rose to $500 million, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $426 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned 38 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 35 cent per share.\nTotal adjusted revenue rose to $1.38 billion from $1.20 billion.\nThe company released the results ahead of schedule after Dow Jones inadvertently published the results.
