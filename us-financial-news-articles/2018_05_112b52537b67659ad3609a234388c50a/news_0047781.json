May 22, 2018; Oakland, CA, USA; Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson (left) loses control of the ball against Houston Rockets guard James Harden (13) and guard Eric Gordon (10) during the third quarter in game four of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Oracle Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\nThompson injured his left knee during Tuesday’s Game 4. Swingman Andre Iguodala, who missed Game 4 with a leg injury, is rated as a game-time decision.\nGolden State coach Steve Kerr was optimistic about Thompson\n“I believe Klay will play,” Kerr told reporters at the midday shootaround. “We’re still listing him as questionable. We’ve got to see how he feels in pregame.”\nKerr isn’t so positive when it comes to Iguodala’s possible return.\n“Incremental progress and we’ll see a game-time decision,” Kerr said of Iguodala. “He needs more treatment. He will probably warm up tonight and we’ll see what happens.”\nThompson is averaging just 10.3 points over the past three games and missed a key tying attempt late in the Game 4 loss. He scored 28 points in Game 1.\nIguodala is averaging 8.7 points in the series.\nThe series is tied at two games apiece.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T23:08:37.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
