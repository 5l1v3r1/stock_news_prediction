Even with strong economic data, strong earnings, the markets are still flat year to date,” said James.\n“The question remains what multiples are people willing to pay for equities in this higher rate environment.”\nAt 13:01 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 74.22 points, or 0.30 percent, at 24,780.63, the S&P 500 was up 14.08 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,725.53 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 55.29 points, or 0.75 percent, at 7,406.92.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with only the rate-sensitive utilities and real estate sectors in the red.\nThe technology index was up 0.5 percent, with chipmakers the biggest gainers.\nMicron jumped 4.4 percent after RBC Capital Markets rated the stock “outperform,” while AMD gained 3.2 percent on a Susquehanna upgrade to “neutral”.\nThe two stocks helped the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index gain 1.24 percent.\nAmong the laggards was 3M Co, which slipped 1 percent and weighed on the Dow after Jefferies cut its rating on the stock to “hold”.\nIQVIA dropped 4.4 percent, the most on the S&P, after the FDA found some inaccuracies on sales data regarding some opioid drug products.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.06-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.53-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 13 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 108 new highs and 39 new lows.
