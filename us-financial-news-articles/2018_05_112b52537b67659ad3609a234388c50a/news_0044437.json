Kumar, a New Delhi-based communications professional and a frequent partygoer.\nIRRITANT FOR RESIDENTS The pub scene in India’s capital has evolved over the years.\nHundreds of small and large pubs have mushroomed across the city to tap youngsters for whom music, alcohol and global cuisines have become an integral part of entertainment.\nBut late-night loud music at pubs - many of them located close to residential areas in the metropolis of more than 20 million people - has become an irritant for those living near.\nPraveen Mishra, a senior official who signed off on the Delhi state’s order, said the government was only enforcing an old rule governing pubs.\nThe pubs are “permitted only to have live singing/playing of instruments by professionals” within their premises, Mishra said in his order last week. “Violations of these rules shall lead to strict action as per law.”\nIt is unclear how the government will regulate the sound from live performances, which are now likely to increase in number. The Times of India newspaper Quote: d a Delhi official saying the rules were “silent” on whether professionals should sing with or without a mike, and what the volume should be.\nReporting by Aditya Kalra Editing by Martin Howell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:18:39.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
