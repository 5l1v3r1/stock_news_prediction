The Irish carrier canceled a number of flights and is advising customers of their options, including a full refund or a free transfer to the next available flight, it said in an emailed statement.\n“We apologize to all customers affected by these disruptions, which are entirely beyond our control,” Ryanair said in the statement, declining to quantify the cancellations.
