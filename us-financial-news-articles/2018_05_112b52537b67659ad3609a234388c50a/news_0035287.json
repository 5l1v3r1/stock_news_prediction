(NASDAQ:AEY), today announced its financial results for the three and six month periods ended March 31, 2018.\n“Revenues for the second fiscal quarter of 2018 increased 3% compared with the same period in the prior year, driven by improved Telco segment sales and partially offset by declines in the Cable TV segment,” commented David Humphrey, President and CEO of ADDvantage Technologies. “On the Telco side, we were pleased to see our new sales strategy and restructuring initiatives at Nave Communications positively impact revenue growth. At Triton Datacom, we continue to be pleased with its overall sales performance despite slightly lower equipment sales due to reduced demand in the market early in the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe that the impact of our sales initiatives at both Nave and Triton, along with improved market demand, will drive top line growth in the Telco segment. Despite experiencing top-line growth this quarter, our operating loss further increased, primarily due to lower revenues from our recycling business this quarter, which was driven by timing of shipments, and lower margins generated from our equipment sales.”\n“Sales in the Cable TV segment continued to be impacted by the market weakness reported in the first fiscal quarter and the loss of a large repair business customer. We have implemented several initiatives to adapt to the declining revenues in this segment, including continued operational process improvements and right-sizing the Company's cost structure. This led to an improvement in operating income of thirteen percentage points compared to last year in the Cable TV segment.\nMr. Humphrey concluded, “Our results for the quarter also included equity losses of $0.3 million for a legal settlement with a subcontractor related to the YKTG Solutions, LLC wireless cell tower decommissioning project and the associated legal expenses. Looking ahead, we believe we now have the framework in place to drive stronger top-line results in our Telco segment, and we have implemented initiatives to improve the margins on our equipment sales, both of which are expected to improve bottom-line results. In addition, we anticipate that our recycling revenue will return to normal levels next quarter, and we do not expect any further expenses related to the YKTG Solutions project. We remain confident in the opportunities to grow market share and build value for shareholders.”\nResults for the three months ended March 31, 2018\nConsolidated sales increased 3% to $11.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $11.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in sales was in the Telco segment of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Cable TV segment of $0.4 million.\nConsolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 7%, to $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $3.7 million in the same period in the prior year. This was due to lower expenses in the Cable TV segment, while the Telco segment was relatively flat.\nThe loss from equity method investment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a legal settlement with a subcontractor on the YKTG Solutions wireless cell tower decommissioning project and the associated legal expenses.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $0.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with net income of $11,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the same period of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.3 million compared with $0.5 million for the same period ended March 31, 2017.\nResults for the six months ended March 31, 2018\nConsolidated sales increased 2% to $23.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $23.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in sales was in the Telco segment of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Cable TV segment of $1.1 million.\nConsolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million, or 3%, to $7.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, from $7.3 million in the same period in the prior year. This was due to lower expenses in the Cable TV segment, and was partially offset by higher Telco segment expenses.\nThe loss from equity method investment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a legal settlement with a subcontractor on the YKTG Solutions wireless cell tower decommissioning project and the associated legal expenses.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million for the same period of 2017. The increase in the tax provision was due primarily to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. One of the provisions of this legislation was to reduce the corporate income tax rates effective beginning January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduced corporate income tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax balances at the reduced corporate income tax rate, which resulted in income tax expense of $0.4 million. The Company estimates that its effective income tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2018 will be approximately 30% as a result of the legislation.\nNet loss for the six months ended March 31, 2018, was $1.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the same period of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.5 million compared with $1.4 million for the same period ended March 31, 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents were $0.9 million as of March 31, 2018, compared with $4.0 million as of September 30, 2017. The decrease in cash was due primarily to the extinguishment of one of the Company’s term loans in December 2017 by paying the outstanding balance of $2.7 million and the first annual guaranteed payment of $0.7 million related to the acquisition of Triton Miami, Inc. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had inventory of $22.3 million, relatively unchanged compared with $22.3 million as of September 30, 2017.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Tuesday, May 15th, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time featuring remarks by David Humphrey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dave Chymiak, Chief Technology Officer, Scott Francis, Chief Financial Officer, and Don Kinison, Vice President of Sales.\nThe conference call will be available via webcast and can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of ADDvantage's website, www.addvantagetechnologies.com .
