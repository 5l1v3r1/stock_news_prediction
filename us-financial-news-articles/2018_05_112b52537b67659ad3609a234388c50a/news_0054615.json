About 10 of them were injured, the source said, asking not to be named for fear of retribution.\nThe U.N. agencies said hundreds more were reportedly still being held by smugglers in the area.\nBani Walid, about 145 km (90 miles) south of Tripoli, has become a major hub for the smuggling and trafficking of migrants who arrive from sub-Saharan African countries trying to reach Libya’s Mediterranean coast.\nFrom there, many seek to travel on towards Italy by boat, though crossings have been sharply reduced since last July when a major smuggling group in the Libyan coastal city of Sabratha struck a deal to halt departures under Italian pressure and was then forced out in clashes.\nLibya’s EU-backed coastguard has also returned more migrants to Libya after intercepting them at sea.\nMigrant community representatives have said smugglers are now operating further inland, especially around Bani Walid, and that migrants who are frequently tortured or raped in order to extort money from them or their families are being held for longer.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami and Aidan Lewis; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:14:27.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
