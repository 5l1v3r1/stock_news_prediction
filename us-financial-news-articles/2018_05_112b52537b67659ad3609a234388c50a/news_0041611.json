SEC, focused on an SEC investigation of Charles Kokesh, an executive accused of stealing money from thousands of small investors who put cash into funds that he managed during the 1990s and early 2000s. A lower court ruled in 2005 that Mr. Kokesh should pay $34.9 million in disgorgement, an amount his attorneys argued was excessive because the SEC could only reach back five years to calculate fines.\nThe SEC argued that disgorgement, or forfeiting ill-gotten gains, wasn’t a penalty because the money goes to pay back harmed investors. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion, decided that disgorgement is a penalty, and thus subject to a five-year statute of limitations that covers such fines.\nRepublicans and Democrats on the House panel appeared taken back by the magnitude of disgorgement that the SEC has given up since the Kokesh decision. Mr. Peikin said the $800 million tally stems from enforcement cases that are in litigation or have been settled since the court’s ruling.\nCongress could change the law to give the SEC more time to file charges against people and firms suspected of defrauding investors. The SEC has been aided by an abundance of whistleblower tips in recent years, but says it sometimes still discovers well-concealed frauds too late.\nTwo of the committee’s top Republican and Democratic members appeared open to writing legislation to extend the statute of limitations for seeking disgorgement.\n“What I want to know…is what we as Congress can do to insure that bad actors aren’t able to profit from their misbehavior and their fraudulent actions?” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.), who chairs the subcommittee that met on Wednesday. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.) also raised the prospect of giving the SEC more time to bring cases.\n“Absent an extension of the statute of limitations, we’re going to live with this,” Mr. Peikin said. “But there will be cases where there is ongoing fraud for years and we don’t discover it until some of that money is out of our reach.”\nLimits on the SEC’s ability to obtain disgorgement could help explain the decline in its enforcement results—as measured by the penalties that firms pay to settle regulatory investigations. The SEC obtained fines against public companies totaling $65 million during the first half of 2018, the lowest amount since at least 2009, according to Cornerstone Research, an economic consulting firm.\nCornerstone reported this week that the SEC’s highest settlement with a public company in 2018 was $14 million, by far the lowest amount in any half year of its data set, which covers the last eight years.\nThe SEC officials told House lawmakers that penalty totals aren’t the best measure of their caseload. Stephanie Avakian, the co-director of SEC enforcement, said a better gauge is whether the regulator recoups money for victimized investors and succeeds in expelling bad actors from the financial industry.\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:37:44.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
