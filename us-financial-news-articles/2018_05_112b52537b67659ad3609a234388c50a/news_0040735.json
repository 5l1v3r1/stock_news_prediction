The deadline will now be 30 years from when they turn 18, up from 20 years now.\nSome critics have mocked the harassment measures as an end to French romance. During Wednesday night’s debate, far-right lawmaker Emmanuelle Menard denounced the legislation as a “witchhunt against men” that outlawed “a certain bawdy behaviour which cannot be compared to harassment.”\nSchiappa last year told Reuters the government was not looking to stamp out flirtatious behaviour and “kill the culture of the ‘French lover’”, but simply looking to establish that consent was key.\nThe legislation will now be debated in the Senate.\n($1 = 0.8472 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:48:25.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
