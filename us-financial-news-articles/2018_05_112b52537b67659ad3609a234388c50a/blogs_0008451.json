It can be offered as an option by sellers. Shares of PayPal dropped 4 percent after the Bloomberg story was published.\nAmazon is again showing its willingness to forgo profits in exchange for expanding a new service. The company has been focusing on adding financial products and is reportedly working on launching a credit account service as well.
