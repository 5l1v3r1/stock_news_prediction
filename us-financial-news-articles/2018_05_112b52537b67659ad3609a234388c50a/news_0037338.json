REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Federica Mogherini made the comments at a news conference in Brussels after hosting the EU’s first “joint council” with Cuba since the bloc dropped all sanctions on the island and agreed ona political framework within which to strengthen ties.\nThe EU has said it is now Cuba’s top trade and investment partner, and arguably plays a bigger role than traditional allies like Venezuela or Russia as the island implements market reforms to its centrally-planned economy.\nAnalysts say the EU has also taken advantage of U.S. indifference or a diplomatic vacuum, as the Trump administration backtracks on a fragile detente with Cuba.\nEuropean International Cooperation and Development Commissioner Neven Mimica, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez pose after a signing ceremony of a cooperation agreement at the EU Council in Brussels, Belgium May 15, 2018.

First Mogherini visited, then a delegation from the European Investment Bank.\nThe bloc signed on Tuesday an agreement with Cuba to invest 18 million euros to help its achieve its ambitious goals in terms of developing renewable energy on the island.\nThe EU has said it will sign cooperation agreements worth 49 million euros in total.\nWriting by Sarah Marsh in Havana; Editing by Tom Brown\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
