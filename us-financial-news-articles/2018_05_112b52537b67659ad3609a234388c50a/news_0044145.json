Mr. Ed Vittoria was also appointed as a member of our Board of Directors to fill an existing vacancy.\n“I am very pleased that Ed has accepted the CEO role. He has been advising Puradyn for the past six months, and his fresh perspective on marketing, strategy and new business development has been well received by the whole Puradyn team as well as our key customers,” said Joseph Vittoria. “We just reported one of our best quarters in years thanks to the improvement in market conditions within our key customer segments and expanded awareness of the savings that are achievable by using our filtration systems. Ed’s decision to join Puradyn is a positive indication that we’re on the right track to growing the business and improving our financial performance.”\n“I am looking forward to contributing to Puradyn’s future success,” said Ed Vittoria. “I am confident that we will continue the positive momentum from the recent quarter because I have heard first hand from existing customers about how much they have saved by using Puradyn’s systems and how they regret not installing them sooner.
