(American), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (NYSE: HE) today reported net income for the first quarter of 2018 of $19.0 million compared to $16.9 million in the fourth, or linked, quarter of 2017 and $15.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Key measures of profitability improved, with return on average equity rising to 12.6%, up 1.49% and 1.76% compared to the linked and prior year quarters, respectively.\n\"Our first quarter results reflect the benefits of our efforts to manage the effects of rising interest rates while we continue to deliver good earning asset growth from our focus on deepening our customer relationships. The bank delivered higher net interest margin, good deposit and loan growth, and – with the bottom line benefits from tax reform – we reported the highest quarterly net income in American's history,\" said Richard Wacker, president and chief executive officer. \"We continued to deliver well for our customers, the bank, and for shareholders, and our team is committed to continuous improvement.\"\nThe lower federal corporate tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced tax expense by approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the linked and first quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the bank recognized a one-time tax benefit of $1.7 million, which was partially offset by the discretionary award of approximately $1 million in special $1,000 cash bonuses paid to employees in December 2017. Beginning in 2018, American also meaningfully increased wage rates for entry level and lower wage positions, increasing compensation costs in the quarter and for the year.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet interest income was $58.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $57.0 million in the linked quarter and $54.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher yields on earning assets and strong deposit growth that funded earning asset growth in the investment portfolio and retail loan portfolios, which include consumer loans, residential loans and home equity lines of credit. Net interest margin was 3.76% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.68% in both the linked and prior year quarter of 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses was $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.7 million in the linked quarter and $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The net charge-off ratio was 0.28% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.26% in the linked quarter and 0.29% in the prior year quarter. Nonaccrual loans as a percent of total loans receivable held for investment was 0.53% compared to 0.51% in the linked quarter and 0.41% in the prior year quarter.\nNoninterest income was $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $15.0 million in the linked quarter and $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in noninterest income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the linked quarter and first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to lower net debit card interchange fees of $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, resulting primarily from a reclassification of $1.0 million in expenses relating to a new accounting standard.\nNoninterest expense was $43.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $45.3 million in the linked quarter and $41.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the linked and prior year quarter includes higher compensation and benefit expense of $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, reflecting a higher minimum wage for employees, along with higher performance-based incentives and annual merit increases, partially offset by the reclassification noted above. As previously mentioned, noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by approximately $1 million in increased compensation for employees through a $1,000 bonus in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nTotal loans were $4.7 billion at March 31, 2018, up $71 million or 6.1% annualized, driven mainly by increases in commercial and commercial real estate loans of $63 million compared to December 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $6.1 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $188 million or 12.8% annualized from December 31, 2017. Low-cost core deposits increased $178 million or 13.9% annualized from December 31, 2017. The average cost of funds was 0.23% for the first quarter of 2018, up 2 basis points from the linked quarter and up 3 basis points from the prior year quarter.\nOverall, American's return on average equity was 12.58% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 11.09% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10.82% in the prior year quarter. Return on average assets was 1.12% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 1.01% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.98% in the same quarter last year. American's solid results enabled it to pay dividends of $10.9 million to HEI while maintaining healthy capital levels -- leverage ratio of 8.6% and total capital ratio of 14.0% at March 31, 2018.\nHEI EARNINGS RELEASE, HEI WEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS EARNINGS AND 2018 EPS GUIDANCE\nConcurrent with American's regulatory filing 30 days after the end of the quarter, American announced its first quarter 2018 financial results today.
