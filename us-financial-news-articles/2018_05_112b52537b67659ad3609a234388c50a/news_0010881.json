(NASDAQ: BLKB), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, today announced the acquisition of Reeher, the industry leader in fundraising performance management for higher education.\nReeher drives fundraising effectiveness and increased impact by equipping individual fundraisers and their teams with the tools and insight they need to assess their performance, as well as benchmark it within their own institution and more broadly. Reeher's customized predictive models also help institutions analyze and score the giving behaviors and characteristics of their constituents to identify and target the highest-potential prospects.\n\"Bringing together Blackbaud's industry-leading analytics and benchmarking capabilities with Reeher's best-in-class individual fundraiser benchmarking is going to create an unparalleled advantage for our customers,\" said Blackbaud Chief Products Officer Kevin McDearis. \"The fundraising organizations driving the most significant impact for their causes and institutions are those with the greatest insight into their own performance. By adding Reeher's exceptional, proven benchmarking capabilities to the already rich analytics and benchmarking portfolio we offer today, we're giving our customers a 360 view into their performance that is unmatched.\"\nToday, Blackbaud's extensive benchmarking capabilities enable organizations and institutions to understand how their fundraising programs compare to others. With Reeher, these benchmarking capabilities will be expanded to also include internal benchmarking to assess fundraising team performance – from understanding how the performance of individual gift officers compare to one another within the same team, to comparing gift officer performance against the staff at other similar organizations. This means that organizations will have unmatched insight both into how their programs and people are performing – insight that can drive more effective fundraising programs.\n\"This is one more way Blackbaud is delivering on our commitment to increase outcomes for the social good community,\" said Mike Gianoni, President and CEO of Blackbaud. \"Just a one percent increase in fundraising effectiveness in the nonprofit space makes $2.8 billion more available for social good impact. Helping institutions ensure that their individual fundraisers are as effective as possible can play a key role in driving more effective fundraising programs – and ultimately, more powerful outcomes.\"\nReeher's St. Paul, Minnesota-based team will join Blackbaud. \"Since founding Reeher in 2002, I have been committed to driving impact for fundraisers and the institutions they support,\" said Andy Reeher, CEO of Reeher. \"I am thrilled to take this impact to the next level, as we accelerate our innovation velocity and scale by joining with the world's leading cloud software company powering social good.\"\nIn the near term, Reeher customers will experience the benefit of Blackbaud's best-in-class predictive analytics, which will enhance the predictive capabilities available to Reeher customers today. Blackbaud customers will benefit from the addition of fundraising performance management capabilities to Blackbaud's portfolio. In the future, Blackbaud intends to bring Reeher's capabilities to its broader customer base, including future expansion to other markets outside of higher education that have major gift officer and annual fund functions.\nReeher is headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. Blackbaud is headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, with operations around the globe, including in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFor more information, visit www.Blackbaud.com/Better-Together .\nAbout Blackbaud\nBlackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB) is the world's leading cloud software company powering social good.
