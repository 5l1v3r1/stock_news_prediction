However, it is unlikely they will have much of a negative impact on lending to buy homes due to tight supply and solid demand, Fratantoni said.\nIn 2018, lenders are expected to make $1.167 trillion in loans for home purchases, up from $1.110 trillion in 2017. They will likely originate $446 billion in mortgages for refinancing, down from $600 billion in 2017, Fratantoni said.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T23:08:48.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
