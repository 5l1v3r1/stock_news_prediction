Founded in 1995, Alunorte produces 5.8 million metric tonnes of alumina a year, according to Norsk Hydro’s website.\nIn his decision on Tuesday upholding the lower court’s ruling, federal Judge Arthur Pinheiro Chaves said that failure to honor the conditions set by the courts would result in a daily fine of 1 million reais ($285,000).\nA spokesman for Norsk Hydro said the company had not formally been notified of the decision and would analyze the case before issuing comment. The spokesman added, however, that the company was already complying with the state court decision and was open to dialogue with stakeholders at the municipal, state and federal levels.\nIn April, the company sued state prosecutors in Para in a bid to spur a new study to assess the spill.\nReporting by Gram Slattery and Flavia Bohone; Editing by Leslie Adler and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T16:05:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
