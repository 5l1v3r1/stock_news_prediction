Reuters could not immediately reach Bright or Lu for comment.\nBright, the parent of listed Bright Dairy and Food Co Ltd ( 600597.SS ), was an active global dealmaker under Lu, with deals for British cereal maker Weetabix, Australian dairy Mundella Foods and Israeli food group Tnuva among others.\nThe firm has been quieter over the past couple of years, and sold Weetabix last year to U.S. firm Post Holdings.
