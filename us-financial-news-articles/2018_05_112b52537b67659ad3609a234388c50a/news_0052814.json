REX management will host a conference call and webcast today at 11:00 a.m. ET.\nConference Call:\n(212) 231-2924 Webcast / Replay URL:\nwww.rexamerican.com/Corp/Page4.aspx\nThe webcast will be available for replay for 30 days REX American Resources’ Q1 ‘18 results principally reflect its interests in six ethanol production facilities and its refined coal operation. One Earth Energy, LLC (“One Earth”) and NuGen Energy, LLC (“NuGen”) are consolidated, while those of its four other ethanol plants are reported as equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates. REX’s financial results also reflect the refined coal entity acquired by the Company in fiscal 2017. The Company reports results for its two business segments as ethanol and by-products, and refined coal.\nREX’s Q1 ‘18 net sales and revenue were $120.8 million, compared with $113.1 million in Q1 ‘17, primarily reflecting the increased ethanol gallons sold as well as higher average selling prices for dried and modified distillers grains during the quarter, which offset lower average selling prices for ethanol. The Company’s Q1 ‘18 gross profit for its ethanol and by-products segment increased to $13.5 million, from $12.5 million in the comparable prior year period. Equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates in Q1 ‘18 was flat at $0.7 million, compared to Q1 ’17. This led to income before income taxes of $11.0 million in Q1 ‘18, compared to $8.9 million in Q1 ‘17 for the ethanol and by-products segment. The Company also recorded a gross loss from its refined coal operation of $2.7 million in Q1 ‘18. While gross profit and income before income taxes were negatively impacted, the Company was able to recognize benefits related to its refined coal operation in the form of a lower effective tax rate. The Company reported income from continuing operations before income taxes and non-controlling interests in Q1 ‘18 of $7.6 million, compared with $8.0 million in Q1 ‘17.\nNet income attributable to REX shareholders in Q1 ‘18 more than doubled to $9.5 million, from $4.5 million in Q1 ‘17, primarily reflecting lower tax rates related to the Company’s refined coal operation and the December 2017 passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Q1 ‘18 diluted net income per share attributable to REX common shareholders was $1.45 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in Q1 ‘17.\nPer share results in Q1 ‘18 and Q1 ‘17 are based on 6,571,000 and 6,593,000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding, respectively.\nSegment Income Statement Data:\nThree Months\nEnded\n($ in thousands) April 30, 2018 2017 Net sales and revenue : Ethanol & By-Products (1) $ 120,680 $ 113,143 Refined coal (2) (3) 140 - Total net sales and revenues $ 120,820 $ 113,143 Gross profit (loss): Ethanol & By-Products (1) $ 13,546 $ 12,489 Refined coal (2) (2,695) - Total gross profit $ 10,851 $ 12,489 Income (loss) before income taxes: Ethanol & By-Products (1) $ 11,009 $ 8,923 Refined coal (2) (2,859) - Corporate and other (501) (921) Total income before income taxes $ 7,649 $ 8,002 Benefit (provision) for income taxes: Ethanol & By-Products $ (1,420) $ (2,705) Refined coal 3,999 - Corporate and other 124 315 Total benefit (provision) before income taxes $ 2,703 $ (2,390) Segment profit (loss): Ethanol & By-Products $ 8,589 $ 5,142 Refined coal 1,271 - Corporate and other (364) (598) Net income attributable to REX common shareholders $ 9,496 $ 4,544 (1)\nIncludes results attributable to non-controlling interests of approximately 25% for One Earth and approximately 1% for NuGen.\n(2)\nIncludes results attributable to non-controlling interests of approximately 5%.\n(3)\nRefined coal sales are reported net of the cost of coal.\nREX American Resources’ Chief Executive Officer, Zafar Rizvi, commented, “Ethanol pricing remained pressured in the first quarter based on industry supply levels and legislative uncertainty. However, our consolidated plants increased the volume of ethanol sold by 9% over last year’s first quarter and with the recovery in distillers grain pricing we grew the gross profit in the ethanol and by-products segment by 8.5%. This growth, combined with the benefits of our refined coal operations and other tax reductions enabled REX to more than double its net income and earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 versus the same period last year.\n“With our healthy balance sheet, including cash and short-term investments of $176 million and working capital of $220 million, we remain well positioned in our continued efforts to build value for our shareholders.”\nBalance Sheet and Share Repurchase Program\nAt April 30, 2018, REX had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $175.7 million, $60.0 million of which was at the parent company, and $115.7 million of which was at its consolidated production facilities. This compares with cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2018, of $191.0 million, $74.1 million of which was at the parent company, and $116.9 million of which was at its consolidated ethanol production facilities.\nOn March 20, 2018, REX’s Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program providing the Company with the authority to repurchase up to an additional 500,000 shares of its common stock. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company purchased 126,141 shares at an average cost of $72.36. Reflecting the balance of the Company’s prior repurchase authorization, REX is now authorized to repurchase up to 525,732 shares of its common stock. The Company had 6,440,628 shares outstanding at April 30, 2018.\nRepurchases by the Company will be subject to available liquidity, general market and economic conditions, alternate uses for the capital and other factors. Share repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, block trades or in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations and other legal requirements. There is no minimum number of shares that the Company is required to repurchase and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. All shares purchased will be held in the Company’s treasury for possible future use.\nThe following table summarizes select data related to the\nCompany’s consolidated Ethanol and By-Products interests:\nThree Months\nEnded\nApril 30, 2018\n2017\nAverage selling price per gallon of ethanol $ 1.33 $ 1.44 Average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains $ 137.75 $ 100.06 Average selling price per pound of non-food grade corn oil $ 0.25 $ 0.28 Average selling price per ton of modified distillers grains $ 70.29 $ 41.91 Average cost per bushel of grain $ 3.50 $ 3.47 Average cost of natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 3.46 $ 3.74 Supplemental Data Related to REX’s Ethanol and By-Products Interests:\nREX American Resources Corporation\nEthanol Ownership Interests/Effective Annual Gallons Shipped as of April 30, 2018\n(gallons in millions)\nEntity\nTrailing Twelve\nMonths Gallons\nShipped\nCurrent\nREX\nOwnership\nInterest\nREX’s Current Effective\nOwnership of Trailing Twelve\nMonth Gallons Shipped\nOne Earth Energy, LLC (Gibson City, IL)\n127.3 75.1% 95.6 NuGen Energy, LLC (Marion, SD)\n134.5 99.5% 133.8 Big River Resources West Burlington, LLC (West Burlington, IA) 108.3 10.3% 11.2 Big River Resources Galva, LLC (Galva, IL)\n127.8 10.3% 13.2 Big River United Energy, LLC (Dyersville, IA)\n129.6 5.7% 7.4 Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC (Boyceville, WI)\n56.9 10.3% 5.9 Total 684.4 n/a 267.1 First Quarter Conference Call\nREX will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET today.
