Ehrenreich plays a younger Solo just beginning his pilot training and seeking his own spaceship when he becomes involved in a dangerous mission in the galaxy far, far away.\nDisney is hoping audiences embrace the movie after reshoots midway through production. Ron Howard finished the film after original directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were fired.\n“This was a very unusual circumstance, and I decided to take it on frankly as a kind of a challenge,” Howard said on the red carpet. “I’m so glad that I jumped in.” Director of the movie Ron Howard (2nd L) poses with cast members (L-R) Clint Howard, Joonas Suotamo, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Thandie Newton, Alden Ehrenreich, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Paul Bettany, Donald Glover and Jon Favreau at the premiere for the movie \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 10, 2018.

He knows how to make surviving look sexy.” Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Additional reporting by Omar Younis; Editing by Catherine Evans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T11:26:39.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
