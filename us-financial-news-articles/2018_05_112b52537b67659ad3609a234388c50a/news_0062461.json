His brother Tom played two tests in England’s recent Ashes defeat in Australia.\nEngland lost the first test at Lord’s by nine wickets and fast bowler James Anderson called on the team to show more fight in the final test of the series starting at Headingley on Friday.\n“It’s going to take some special individual performances this week,” Anderson told the BBC. “If you get one or two individuals standing up, then people can piggyback on that and take confidence as well.\n“It’s quite easy for the confidence of the team to take a hit when you have a defeat like that. So we’ll try, as well as using our skill, to use our heart, to use the fight we have in the dressing room to show people what we can do.” (Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T22:05:44.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
