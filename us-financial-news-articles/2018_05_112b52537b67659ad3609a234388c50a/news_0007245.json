Jenna is one of the pioneers in the programmatic industry, and we know our clients will enjoy more success with her on board.\"\nAbout Anagram\nAnagram is a digital media agency built for the modern marketing era, with data and technology at our core. As marketing becomes more complex, we find that our client's needs are quite varied, and tend to evolve over time.
