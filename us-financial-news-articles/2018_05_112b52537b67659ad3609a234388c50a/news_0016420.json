Total distance: 307.104km (66 laps)\n2017 pole: Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes, one minute 19.141 seconds.\n2017 winner: Hamilton\nRace lap record: 1:21.670, Kimi Raikkonen (Finland), Ferrari 2008.\nStart time: 1310 GMT RACE WINS\nHamilton has 63 victories from 212 races and is second in the all-time list behind seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher (91). Vettel has 49.\nFerrari have won 231 races since 1950, McLaren 182, Williams 114, Mercedes 77 and Red Bull 56. Former champions McLaren and Williams have not won since 2012. POLE POSITION\nHamilton has a record 73 career poles. Vettel has 53.\nVettel has been on pole for the last three races. The last time Vettel had four poles in a row was during the 2011 season when he was at Red Bull.\nFerrari have not had four successive poles since 2007 and Vettel has yet to be on pole in Barcelona. Hamilton has been on pole three times in the last four years at the Circuit de Catalunya.\nMax Verstappen, at 20 years old, can become the youngest ever pole sitter this season. The current youngest is Vettel, who did it at the age of 21 years and 72 days. PODIUM\nHamilton has 120 career podiums and is second on the all-time list behind Schumacher (155). Vettel has 101, Kimi Raikkonen 94. POINTS\nHamilton has had a record 29 successive scoring finishes to date.\nRussian rookie Sergey Sirotkin(Williams) is now the only driver on the starting grid yet to score a point in his career. Haas’s Romain Grosjean has also yet to open his account for the season. SPAIN\nUntil last year, when Hamilton won for the second time, the Spanish Grand Prix had been won by a sequence of 10 different drivers.\nFernando Alonso (2006, 2013), Hamilton (2014, 2017) and Kimi Raikkonen (2005, 2008) are the only current drivers to have won twice in Spain.\nOther active winners are Verstappen (2016) and Vettel (2011).\nAll but three of the last 17 Spanish Grands Prix have been won from pole position. Those three were all in the last seven years, however.\nThe only drivers to win in Barcelona without starting on the front row are Michael Schumacher (third on the grid in 1996), Alonso (from fifth in 2013) and Verstappen (fourth in 2016).\nAlonso is the only Spaniard to have won a grand prix.\nFerrari are the most successful team at the Circuit de Catalunya with eight wins. Since the first Spanish Grand Prix in 1951, the Italian team have won it 12 times. MILESTONE\nMercedes took their first win of the season in Baku. That ended a run of three races without a win, the first time that had happened in the V6 turbo hybrid era that started in 2014.\nRed Bull can take their 150th podium finish on Sunday, having failed to do so in Baku when both cars collided.\nSpain will also be Red Bull’s 250th race, but they are celebrating that landmark in Monaco rather than Barcelona since they did not start the 2005 U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis.\nVettel can take his 50th win on Sunday.
