The Sharks (28) could also still sneak in as the eighth-qualifier.\nThe Waratahs’ final four games are against Australian conference teams, including a crucial clash against the Rebels in Melbourne after the June international break.\nThe Rebels, however, have a tougher run in with two games against New Zealand’s Auckland Blues at Eden Park next Saturday and the Highlanders in Dunedin in the final round.
