REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo Commerzbank analyst Ingo Martin Schachel said the results were strong at every level and mainly linked to higher profit margins, with plants running at full capacity after capacity reduction in Europe and North America and protective trade measures already in place.\n“The first quarter was better than expected and the market backdrop for the second and third quarters is better than we imagined at the start of the year. It’s improving almost on a week-by-week basis,” he said.\nArcelorMittal said its average steel selling price was 18.2 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2017, with shipments up 1.4 percent. For iron ore, of which it mines more than 50 million tonnes a year, shipments rose 5.5 percent, while prices were down 13.1 percent.\nThe firm has been a vocal supporter of trade measures against cheap imports into both the United States and the European Union, where it has the bulk of its operations.\n“Comprehensive solution for unfairly trade imports across geographies still required,” ArcelorMittal said in an overview of EU and U.S. measures, including the 25 percent import tariffs imposed since March 23 by Trump, with certain temporary exemptions, such as for EU steel.\nThe principal target of such measures has been China, the world’s largest consumer and producer of steel and a key gauge for the global industry, even though ArcelorMittal itself has no direct exposure to the Chinese market.\nChinese steel exports declined at the start of the year as local demand has grown and the state has reined its domestic steel capacity to curb stifling smog. However, they jumped in April despite the U.S. tariffs.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T09:34:13.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
