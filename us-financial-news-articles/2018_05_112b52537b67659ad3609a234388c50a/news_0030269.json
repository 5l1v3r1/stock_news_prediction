(NASDAQ:ICAD) , a global medical technology leader providing innovative cancer detection and therapy solutions, today reported financial results for the first quarter\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nTotal revenue of $6.3 million, down 7% year-over-year Gross profit of $4.5 million, or 71% GAAP Net Loss of $(3.3) million, or $(0.20) per share Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(2.4) million\n“The first quarter of 2018 was extremely important to the transformation of the Company,” said Ken Ferry, Chief Executive Officer of iCAD, Inc. “During the quarter, we received CE Mark approval for Version 2.0 of our PowerLook Tomo Detection software in Europe, while at the same time advancing our product development program for Version 2.0 in the U.S. to the point where an FDA submission is imminent. This submission is based on the promising results of our pivotal clinical reader study where radiologists saw a meaningful increase in sensitivity and specificity, as well as a substantial decrease in reader time when using our software to interpret Tomo exams.”\n“While our first quarter Detection revenues were softer than anticipated, we continue to see strong interest in, and demand for, our PowerLook Tomo Detection software in the marketplace. We firmly believe that this product platform will be a significant growth driver for iCAD for years to come,” continued Mr. Ferry. “In our Therapy business, we successfully executed on our first quarter plan to discontinue offering the subscription service model to our skin brachytherapy customers, which reduced delivery service headcount, improved gross margin percentage and decreased cash burn. We are focused on expanding our capital customer base, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where we are experiencing increased levels of interest for our breast and gynecological therapy offerings.”\n“Overall, we are executing on our strategic priorities with a strict focus on managing expenses, and expect iCAD to reach cash flow breakeven by year-end,” concluded Mr. Ferry.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue: Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 7% to $6.3 million from $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting a 4% decrease in product revenue and a 10% decrease in service and supplies revenue.\nIn $000's Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change % Change Product revenue $ 3,014 $ 3,131 $ (117 ) (4 )% Service and supplies revenue 3,299 3,660 (361 ) (10 )% Total Revenue $ 6,313 $ 6,791 $ (478 ) (7 )% Cancer detection revenue, which includes revenue from our digital mammography, breast density, and CT CAD platforms, as well as the associated service and supplies revenue, for the first quarter of 2018, decreased $0.5 million, or 11%, to $4.0 million, as compared to $4.5 million in the same period in 2017. The year-over-year detection results were negatively impacted by the inclusion of $0.3 million in MRI Detection revenue in the first quarter of 2017. The MRI assets were divested in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding MRI revenue, first quarter 2018 cancer detection revenues decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, from the first quarter of 2017. Therapy revenue, which includes Xoft® Axxent® Electronic Brachytherapy System® product sales, as well as the associated service and supplies revenue, for the first quarter of 2018, was flat at $2.3 million as compared to the corresponding period of 2017, as a result of a 13% increase in therapy product revenue, and a 3% decrease in service and supplies revenue. Total company revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018, excluding the impact of MRI revenues, decreased 4% to $6.3 million from $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn $000's Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change % Change Detection revenue Product revenue $ 2,489 $ 2,667 $ (178 ) (7 )% Service and supplies revenue 1,522 1,822 (300 ) (16 )% Detection Revenue $ 4,011 $ 4,489 $ (478 ) (11 )% Therapy revenue Product revenue $ 525 $ 464 $ 61 13 % Service and supplies revenue 1,777 1,838 (61 ) (3 )% Therapy Revenue $ 2,302 $ 2,302 $ - 0 % Total Revenue $ 6,313 $ 6,791 $ (478 ) (7 )% Gross Profit: Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.5 million, or 71% of revenue, compared with $4.7 million, or 69% of revenue, for the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit dollars was due to lower detection revenues. The year-over-year increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to incremental gross profit margin associated with the exit from our skin subscription service business.\nOperating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $2.5 million to $7.6 million from $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the presence of the gain from the sale of the MRI assets recorded in the prior year quarter, totaling $2.5 million. Absent this gain, operating expenses were flat year-over-year at $7.6 million, as incremental engineering and product development costs associated with our Tomo Detection Version 2.0 study were fully offset by lower stock compensation and marketing and sales costs.\nGAAP Net Loss: Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $(3.3) million, or $(0.20) per share, compared with a net loss of $(0.5) million, or $(0.03) per share, for the first quarter of 2017. The $2.8 million year-over-year increase in net loss was primarily due to a $0.2 million decrease in gross profit and the absence of the $2.5 million gain from the sale of the MRI assets recorded in the prior year quarter.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA: Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below, was a loss of $(2.4) million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $(1.5) million for the first quarter of 2017. The $0.9 million year-over-year increase in Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily driven by the increase in engineering and product development costs associated with our Tomo Detection Version 2.0 study and the decrease in gross profit. Please refer to the section entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable GAAP Measures” and the accompanying financial table included at the end of this release for a reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA results for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents: As of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.7 million, compared with $9.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\niCAD management will host a conference and live webcast call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results and provide a Company update.

An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nWhile management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the Company's business operations, investors are reminded to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and management may utilize other measures to illustrate performance in the future. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and, therefore, such non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation. They should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The reconciliations of these historic non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Set forth below is a reconciliation of the Company's \"Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\" (Unaudited) (In thousands except for per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Net Loss $ (3,281 ) $ (457 ) Interest Expense 142 5 Other income (22 ) - Stock Compensation 391 969 Depreciation 96 287 Amortization 92 133 Tax expense 13 17 Severance 144 - Gain on sale of MRI assets - (2,508 ) Loss on disposal of assets 12 - Acquisition related - 37 Litigation related 42 - Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ (2,371 ) $ (1,517 )\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Net Loss $ (3,281 ) $ (457 ) Adjustments to Net Loss: Gain on sale of MRI assets - (2,508 ) Severance 144 - Loss on disposal of assets 12 - Acquisition related - 37 Litigation related 42 - Non-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss)/Income $ (3,083 ) $ (2,928 ) Net (Loss)/Income per share GAAP Net (Loss)/Income per share $ (0.20 ) $ (0.03 ) Adjustments to Net (Loss)/Income (as detailed above) 0.01 (0.15 ) Non-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss)/Income per share $ (0.19 ) $ (0.18 ) Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. However, management believes that in order to understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and/or impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in the Company's ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of the Company's ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management's ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to its peers and competitors.\nManagement defines \"Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\" as the sum of GAAP Net Loss before provisions for interest expense, other income, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, tax expense, severance, gain on sale of assets, loss on disposal of assets, acquisition and litigation related expenses. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a good measure of its historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact the Company's overall financial performance.\nManagement excludes each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item:\nInterest expense: The Company excludes interest expense which includes interest from the facility agreement, interest on settlement obligations and interest on capital leases, from its non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA calculation. Stock-based compensation expense: excluded as these are non-cash expenses that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the Company's business, and also because the total amount of expense is partially outside of the Company's control as it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred. Amortization and Depreciation: Purchased assets and intangibles are amortized over a period of several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after they are acquired. Accordingly, these non-cash items are not considered by management in making operating decisions, and management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Thus, including such charges does not accurately reflect the performance of the Company's ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred. Severance relates to costs incurred due to the termination of certain employees. The Company provides compensation to certain employees as an accommodation upon termination of employment without cause. Management believes that excluding severance costs from operating results provides investors with a better means for measuring current Company performance. Gain on sale of MRI assets relates to the gain realized on the sale of the MRI assets. The Company excludes this item as it is not considered by management in making operating decisions, and management believes that such items do not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Acquisition related: relates to professional service fees due to acquisitions. The Company does not consider these acquisition-related costs to be related to the organic continuing operations of the acquired businesses and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets. Litigation related: These expenses consist primarily of settlement, legal and other professional fees related to litigation. The Company excludes these costs from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the Company believes that these costs have no direct correlation to the core operations of the Company.\nOn occasion in the future, there may be other items, such as significant asset impairments, restructuring charges or significant gains or losses from contingencies that the Company may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nSource:iCAD, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=j2jSeZzC8oUEid4gODPv3FUzj6xgjkaRWCRxcj9GrSuNOO14IoaACn4JYiQXLl4iK_an6Hx93FIuDMZxT3n7MA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fp8pW4R-RlW9wSKf2oA958yy1J7_poP_jdhuLwKIOR4jDt0cUzM6CxXXtukq5tNE6WDczTeKUkht-ze035OuHA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=j2jSeZzC8oUEid4gODPv3LgiYGiQYfNQBWEFXZx2b21v9rywZ4BFG7FKz6PWbXwwl8PIFvJCemm5C9eYAuyHwA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GToGmD1wx9sIkCGrQVnXORvLyb_z_81K0WbC8gXyBCISoyviZ-KrA8-YiYRflZeSgxAO-Vx4DL9r7VZKHJ2KTA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d34a6741-922b-44cf-8367-d2475a320b4a", "http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129486", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Jsg6WrDoHrwA9KTa8k8KjSWO32M-BofIs4__fHSHMysAq42-FQYqjnym32qz61nSotlakQH1RP3s1rY0NdCsMA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GToGmD1wx9sIkCGrQVnXOSrv-Zy-Ckde7GDO-CkpOURWNkMDbvaMoNrvPgB3Ft_C0MEZRDb36c9aM6hXLOf2alPqWNxiNBUSap6duMnKAII2SA_h5hkgjb15qc5xyeKNp_EPb6uDs5MIlQWIYeDO5g==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s9Kkbi0XXdXcZyTH62E4hB0lbxii7ZYggJkiGUTuSjCW36NeOdmSsv46rvuRCaktIBPubKBO3N3UxG8b_CIAcQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=B_neWak2UqWyqXAdSzvJXdekM92d_7X5Kos-OtPTPe3w2qijsSu4xoeu-4EzomCOV-815gMQ9JOR9jHPd0N29ydxhJY6-WUJOMQJUs5T1KRJs6xAXSYC5Mp5pFiItiDt"], "published": "2018-05-15T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:37:59.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
