A Fortis hospital building is pictured in Gurgaon, India, May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal\nFortis Healthcare organised the vote after two major shareholders -- Eastbridge Capital and Jupiter India which together control about 12 percent of the company -- called for the removal of four directors.( bit.ly/2IVl6y4 )\nThree of those directors — Harpal Singh, Tejinder Singh Shergill and Sabina Vaisoha — resigned on Sunday citing personal reasons, Fortis said in separate statements.\nA fourth director, Brian Tempest, still faces a vote on Tuesday.\nFortis Healthcare, which operates about 45 healthcare facilities in India, Dubai, Mauritius and Sri Lanka, has been the target of lengthy takeover tussle involving five suitors.\nOn May 11, Fortis said it planned to accept an offer from Hero Enterprise Investment Office and Burman Family Office to together invest 18 billion rupees (198 million pounds), valuing Fortis at 90 billion rupees.\nThat decision angered some investors and shares in the cash-strapped hospital operator fell almost 5 percent\nA few days later, India’s Manipal Hospital and private equity firm TPG Capital Management TPG.UL sweetened their bid for Fortis, sparking a rally in the company’s shares.\nThe keen interest in Fortis has emerged as private healthcare spending in India is on the rise, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to implement a healthcare programme aimed at providing insurance cover to hundreds of millions of people in a country that lacks adequate heath facilities.\nThe scheme is expected to make private hospitals, such as those run by Manipal and Fortis, accessible to millions of poor families, say analysts.
