Similar funds have returned, on average, a 0.22% decline in 2018, Morningstar said.\n“Even for unconstrained bond funds, it’s rare for such a sharp decline,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & Mutual Fund research at CFRA.\nMore\nBill Gross to Sell Rare U.S. Stamp Collection for More Than $9 Million (Feb. 12) Pimco Posts Best Quarterly Profit Since Bill Gross Left (Feb. 16) Is the Great Bond Blowout Finally Happening? (Jan. 10) Mr. Rosenbluth said Mr. Gross may have been caught flat-footed during Tuesday’s selloff of Italian bonds. Fearful of an escalating political crisis, investors fled to safer U.S. and German credits.\n“He took a stand that the spread between Italian and German bonds was going to go in one direction, and now it’s gone the opposite,” he said.\nCalls to a Janus Henderson spokeswoman weren’t immediately returned.\nThe fund’s decline is a setback for Mr. Gross, who joined Janus Capital Group Inc. from Pacific Investment Management Co. in 2014 following a bitter fight with some of his former colleagues. Janus merged with the U.K.’s Henderson Group in 2017.\nMr. Gross appeared to signal a call for shorting German bonds in his first-quarter letter to investors, noting that a March statement by the European Central Bank had paved the way for higher interest rates across the continent.\nHe didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nEuropean investors had “piled into the region’s safe havens, namely German Bunds,” earlier this year after stocks declined sharply, Mr. Gross wrote. German bond yields, which had been on the rise as the nation’s economic picture improved, also plummeted, he said.\n“Given these conditions, it is difficult to find the rationale for 10-Bunds to be yielding just 0.50% and yields on German government debt up to six years in maturity to be negative,” he wrote.\nWrite to Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:30:13.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
