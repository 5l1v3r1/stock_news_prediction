Griffiths said that the few extra contract clauses would be \"a simple thing any company can handle.\"\nAnother UN proposal asks the companies to ensure through their contracts that the vessels keep their tracking systems switched on at all times.\nThe tracking beacons, known as \"automatic identification systems,\" play a crucial role in monitoring illegal trades at sea. To circumvent the UN's strict quotas on deliveries of petroleum products to North Korea — or the outright ban on buying North Korean coal — vessels will turn off their AIS beacons when they rendezvous with North Korean ships for offshore trades.\nIn every case of ship-to-ship trades with North Korea, Griffiths said, \"the vessels switch off their AIS just before they meet at sea, meaning that they cannot be tracked any longer.\" Griffiths called the blackouts \"an immediate risk indicator.\"\nHe added: \"If a vessel switches off its AIS at sea, there is a heightened risk that it's doing something clandestine or illegal.\" Targeting incentives\nThe UN is targeting insurance companies and commodity traders in these transfers for effectiveness and simplicity.\nGriffiths said only about 10 insurance and reinsurance companies and a similar number of commodity traders connected to the ships are making hidden trades with North Korea.\nMore importantly, Griffiths said, \"All the ships that have been involved in these illicit ship-to-ship transfers ... have Western reinsurance.\" Ship captains, who need insurance to operate, would be placing their careers at risk if they defied their insurance contracts by switching off their AIS trackers. Kevin Breuninger | CNBC CNBC’s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera views maritime intelligence software programs with United Nations North Korea panel coordinator Hugh Griffiths at Two United Nations Plaza on May 4, 2018.\nThe entities skirting the sanctions on North Korea have taken advantage of an increasingly globalized trade landscape, prompting the UN to seek solutions that create incentives for companies to comply with new restrictions, Griffiths said.\nHe said the sanctions \"are working better than they've ever worked before\" — but even still, ships are going dark.\nAmong the only reason that a vessel's tracker could be appropriately disabled, Griffiths said, would be to mitigate the threat of alerting pirates of its position.\nThat loophole could create problems when targeting North Korea because the country's vessels \"are now behaving a bit like pirates,\" Griffiths said, by disguising their ships, sailing under false names and hiding their tracking numbers.\n\"So it's just possible in theory that a captain approaching a North Korean tanker might think he's dealing with a vessel belonging to another country,\" Griffiths said. Going dark\nEven as Kim's authoritarian regime appears to be taking steps to thaw its hostile relations with other world powers, Griffiths said UN member states have been able to monitor five to 10 sanction-defying trades each month.\nAs long as the ships continue to switch off their trackers, it's extremely difficult for the UN to monitor the petroleum product trades.\n\"It's impossible to physically detect these transfers because they switch off their AIS and they go dark and we can no longer see what they're doing,\" Griffiths said.\nAs for North Korea itself, Griffiths said the country still regards the Security Council as illegitimate.\n\"North Korean tankers are now always dark,\" Griffiths said.\nThe most recent report from the council's panel of experts on North Korea concluded that the country made $200 million in ship-to-ship transfers in the first nine months of 2017.\nGriffiths said that despite North Korea's sudden warmth toward its southern neighbor, the transfers have continued. He said his team has witnessed a $40 million transfer in just one network within the past six months.\nAnd even with an increase in talk of peace initiatives — including the prospect of a face-to-face meeting between Kim and President Donald Trump — Griffiths isn't so sure that denuclearization is on the way.\nThe UN coordinator noted that Kim, in his 2018 New Year's address, said that sanctions were indeed having an effect. \"But another thing he talked about was the mass production of nuclear weapons. And that is something that is extremely difficult for our panel to track, and it's something I'm concerned about,\" Griffiths said.\nNuclear missile launch tests are understandably easy to track. But the assembly of nuclear weapons, which could be taking place in covered or underground facilities, is far more difficult to monitor.\n\"Some of this is above my pay grade,\" Griffiths cautioned, \"but I think [with] the statements made by chairman Kim Jong Un about mass production, it would be very important to get into these sites and to see what's happening there.\" Michelle Caruso-Cabrera CNBC Chief International Correspondent and \"Power Lunch\" Co-Anchor Kevin Breuninger Special to CNBC.com Playing", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:16:03.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
