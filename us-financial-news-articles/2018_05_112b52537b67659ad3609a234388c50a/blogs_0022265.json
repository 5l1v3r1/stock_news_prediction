The websites are turning red to raise awareness of the issue. We have the signatures. On May 9th, we officially file the petition to force a vote on the Senate floor to save #NetNeutrality .\n— Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) April 30, 2018\nEach participating website will feature a “red alert” along the bottom of its homepage that automatically expands with messages encouraging users to urge their lawmakers to vote yes on the CRA. The “Red Alert” widget will remain on all the sites until the Senate votes.\nSee how to add a “Red Alert” to your site here .
