(Nasdaq:NYMT) (“NYMT,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nSummary of First Quarter 2018:\nNet income attributable to common stockholders of $23.7 million, or $0.21 per share (basic), and comprehensive loss to common stockholders of $0.8 million, or $0.01 per share. Net interest income of $19.8 million and portfolio net interest margin of 286 basis points. Book value per common share of $5.79 at March 31, 2018, a decrease of 3.5% from December 31, 2017, resulting in an economic loss of 0.2% for the quarter. Declared first quarter dividend of $0.20 per common share that was paid on April 26, 2018.\nManagement Overview\nSteven Mumma, NYMT’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “the Company continued to benefit from its focus on multi-family credit, with multi-family assets, particularly the Company’s K-Series investments, contributing nicely to both net interest margin as well as portfolio valuation improvements, which helped offset some of the pressure on our Agency RMBS portfolio during the quarter. The Company’s net interest margin for the first quarter expanded by 47 basis points from the prior quarter, with credit assets the primary driver of that improvement. All of this in the back drop of what is currently a very challenging market environment for fixed-income strategies, where liability costs are rising and overall interest rate volatility is increasing the costs of hedging and placing downward pressure on some of our strategies.\nOn the acquisition side, the quarter was relatively quiet. We continued to grow our credit portfolio, adding approximately $33.9 million in multi-family investments and second mortgages. The build in credit assets remains gradual, as the demand for credit assets continues to be highly competitive. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to asset selection as we believe this is the key to positive long-term performance and remain focused on growing our credit portfolio in 2018.\"\nCapital Allocation\nThe following tables set forth our allocated capital by investment type at March 31, 2018, our interest income and interest expense by investment type, and the weighted average yield, average cost of funds and portfolio net interest margin for our average interest earning assets (by investment type) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nCapital Allocation at March 31, 2018: Agency RMBS (1) Multi-Family (2) Distressed Residential (3) Other (4) Total Carrying Value $ 1,161,445 $ 836,353 $ 461,305 $ 150,461 $ 2,609,564 Liabilities Callable (5) (934,367 ) (315,931 ) (155,965 ) (30,100 ) (1,436,363 ) Non-Callable — (29,390 ) (40,825 ) (112,154 ) (182,369 ) Convertible — — — (129,242 ) (129,242 ) Hedges (Net) (6) 9,915 — — — 9,915 Cash (7) 12,284 15,739 436 37,743 66,202 Goodwill — — — 25,222 25,222 Other 2,128 (5,958 ) 17,610 (25,922 ) (12,142 ) Net Capital Allocated $ 251,405 $ 500,813 $ 282,561 $ (83,992 ) $ 950,787 % of Capital Allocated 26.4 % 52.7 % 29.7 % (8.8 )% 100.0 % Net Interest Income- Three Months Ended March 31, 2018: Interest Income $ 7,971 $ 17,493 $ 7,311 $ 1,638 $ 34,413 Interest Expense (4,407 ) (3,890 ) (2,291 ) (4,073 ) (14,661 ) Net Interest Income (Expense) $ 3,564 $ 13,603 $ 5,020 $ (2,435 ) $ 19,752 Portfolio Net Interest Margin - Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Average Interest Earning Assets (8) $ 1,208,900 $ 612,357 $ 467,898 $ 136,135 $ 2,425,290 Weighted Average Yield on Interest Earning Assets (9) 2.64 % 11.43 % 6.25 % 4.81 % 5.68 % Less: Average Cost of Funds (10) (1.82 )% (4.51 )% (4.45 )% (3.25 )% (2.82 )% Portfolio Net Interest Margin (11) 0.82 % 6.92 % 1.80 % 1.56 % 2.86 %\n(1) Includes Agency fixed-rate RMBS, Agency ARMs and Agency IOs.

Prepayment History\nThe following table sets forth the constant prepayment rates (“CPR”) for selected asset classes, by quarter, for the quarterly periods indicated.\nQuarter Ended Agency\nFixed-Rate RMBS Agency\nARMs Agency\nIOs Residential Securitizations March 31, 2018 5.4 % 10.2 % 10.2 % 10.8 % December 31, 2017 6.3 % 12.9 % 17.8 % 22.1 % September 30, 2017 12.8 % 9.4 % 17.4 % 18.2 % June 30, 2017 9.6 % 16.5 % 17.5 % 16.8 % March 31, 2017 10.6 % 8.3 % 15.9 % 5.1 % December 31, 2016 12.3 % 21.7 % 19.4 % 11.1 % September 30, 2016 10.0 % 20.7 % 18.2 % 15.9 % June 30, 2016 10.2 % 17.6 % 15.6 % 17.8 % March 31, 2016 7.9 % 13.5 % 14.7 % 14.8 % First Quarter Earnings Summary\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $23.7 million as compared to $24.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nWe generated net interest income of $19.8 million and a portfolio net interest margin of 286 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to net interest income of $15.0 million and a portfolio net interest margin of 239 basis points for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The $4.8 million increase in net interest income in the first quarter was primarily due to higher net interest income generated by both our Agency RMBS portfolio and distressed residential portfolio. Our Agency RMBS portfolio produced an additional $0.8 million of net interest margin during the first quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in average interest earning assets in that portfolio of $237 million. In addition, our distressed residential portfolio experienced an increase in asset yield of 257 basis points, which generated higher net interest margin of $3.3 million in this portfolio over the prior quarter. The improvement in net interest margin in the Company's distressed residential portfolio is largely attributable to changes in expected cash flows resulting from decreased loan sale activity in the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we recognized other income of $21.0 million as compared to other income of $25.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other income of $4.2 million is primarily driven by:\nA decrease in net unrealized gains on multi-family loans and debt held in securitization trusts of $6.1 million. A decrease in realized gains on distressed residential mortgage loans of $5.8 million as a result of limited loan sales activity during the quarter. An increase in net realized loss on investment securities and related hedges of $3.4 million resulting from the continued divestment of our Agency IO portfolio, partially offset by an unrealized loss recovery of $2.7 million previously recognized on these assets and included in the net unrealized gain on investment securities and related hedges, as discussed below. An increase in net unrealized gain on investment securities and related hedges of $11.4 million primarily consisting of a $9.0 million unrealized gain from our interest rate swaps accounted for as trading instruments for accounting purposes and the $2.7 million gain from our Agency IO portfolio. An increase in other income of $2.5 million, which is primarily due to a $2.3 million gain recognized by a consolidated variable interest entity from the sale of its multi-family apartment community (which is fully allocated to net income attributable to non-controlling interest in consolidated variable interest entities on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations - see the table below for further information).\nThe following table details the general and administrative expenses for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended General and Administrative Expenses March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Salaries, benefits and directors’ compensation $ 2,556 $ 2,415 Base management and incentive fees 833 163 Other general and administrative expenses 2,100 1,747 Total general and administrative expenses $ 5,489 $ 4,325 The following table details the operating expenses related to our distressed residential mortgage loans and the operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Operating Expenses March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Expenses related to distressed residential mortgage loans $ 1,603 $ 2,064 Expenses related to operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities 1,606 1,899 Total operating expenses $ 3,209 $ 3,963 The decrease in operating expenses in the first quarter can be primarily attributed to a decrease in expenses related to our distressed residential loan strategy due to lower sales activity during the first quarter.\nThe results of operations applicable to the operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities included in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Gain on sale of real estate in consolidated variable interest entities $ 2,328 Income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities 2,126 Expenses related to operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities (1,606 ) Net income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities 2,848 Net income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities attributable to non-controlling interest (2,539 ) Net income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities attributable to Company's common stockholders $ 309 Analysis of Changes in Book Value\nThe following table analyzes the changes in book value of our common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (amounts in thousands, except per share):\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 Amount Shares Per Share (1) Beginning Balance $ 671,865 111,910 $ 6.00 Common stock issuance, net (2) 389 207 Balance after share issuance activity 672,254 112,117 6.00 Dividends declared (22,423 ) (0.20 ) Net change in accumulated other comprehensive income: Investment securities (3) (24,478 ) (0.22 ) Net income attributable to Company's common stockholders 23,693 0.21 Ending Balance $ 649,046 112,117 $ 5.79\n(1) Outstanding shares used to calculate book value per share for the ending balance is based on outstanding shares as of March 31, 2018 of 112,116,506. (2) Includes amortization of stock based compensation. (3) The $24.5 million decrease related to investment securities is primarily due to a decline in the value of the Agency RMBS portfolio, which decreased by $24.7 million during the quarter, partially offset by a $9.0 million unrealized gain from our interest rate swaps recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
