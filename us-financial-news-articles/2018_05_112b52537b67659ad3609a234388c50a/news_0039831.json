On a weekly basis, spreads were wider by 30 basis points, its biggest weekly move since April 2015.\n“We’ve had headlines left, right and centre from Italy this week and while the upshot is that the reality is not as scary as thought, the investment community is meeting and deliberating their next steps,” said Commerzbank’s head of rates Christoph Rieger.\n“They see the true state of mind of the government and, while the measures don’t include debt writedowns, it’s clear that there will be no fiscal restraint and no structural reforms for a country that desperately needs it.”\nItaly’s 10-year government bond yield climbed 10 basis points (bps) to 2.22 percent, its highest level since last October. It is up more than 30 bps this week, set for its biggest weekly jump since June 2015.\nEarlier this week, two-year Italian bond yields pushed back into positive territory - making Italy the only euro zone country other than Greece to have two-year borrowing costs above zero.\nTo view a graphic on Turbulent week for Italian bonds, click: reut.rs/2Lab5vn\nBased on the stated spending plans of a 5-Star/League coalition, analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that Italy’s 2019 government deficit-to-GDP ratio could rise to around 3.5 percent - well above the 0.8 percent the Italian government projected in a Stability Pact recently submitted to the European Commission.\nThe Italian developments meanwhile increased investors’ bearishness on the euro, which fell 0.2 percent to $1.1778 to approach the five-month low reached on Wednesday of $1.1763.\nFILE PHOTO: Presentation of a new 2 Euro commemorative coin of former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in Berlin, Germany, February 2, 2018. REUTERS/Christian Mang Options markets show investors are more bearish on the euro over the next six and 12 months than at any time since November, though this is also partly because of a recent dollar rally.\nWhile euro weakness boosted euro zone stocks .STOXXE, Italian stocks .FTMIB were down more than one percent with banks the biggest drag on the index. The sector .FTIT8300 sank 2.3 percent to a six-week low.\nItaly’s main stock index was also headed for its worst weekly drop in more than two months, down 2.6 percent on the week.\n“We have read the (5-Star/ League government) contract and the big question mark is where are they going to get the money?” Banor SIM head of equities Angelo Meda said.\nTo view a graphic on Italian stocks taking a tumble, click: reut.rs/2Lc6PLU\nUNEASY In a further sign that investors are ratcheting up Italy risk, the cost of insuring Italian debt against a sovereign default rose to its highest in more than four months ITGV5YUSAC=MG.

DBRS has Italy on a BBB rating - an investment grade score - with a stable outlook.\nAnalysts said the prospect of increased short-term bond issuance was also causing some concern in bond markets.\nThe common government policy agenda of Italy’s government would include the issuance of short-term government bonds to pay companies owed money by the state, the League’s economics chief, Claudio Borghi, said on Friday.\nStill, although the Italian/German bond yield spread has widened substantially this week, the gap remains below levels seen early last year when euro-break up fears gripped markets ahead of French elections. It’s also well below the plus 500 bps level seen during that 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis.\nTo view a graphic on Italy's 10-year bond spread verses Germany, click: reut.rs/2LeCVGu\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, Sujata Rao, Helen Reid, Tom Finn, Karin Strohecker in London; Danilo Masoni in Milan; Editing by Louise Ireland/Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://reut.rs/2Lc6PLU", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://reut.rs/2Lab5vn", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://reut.rs/2LeCVGu"], "published": "2018-05-18T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:56:19.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
