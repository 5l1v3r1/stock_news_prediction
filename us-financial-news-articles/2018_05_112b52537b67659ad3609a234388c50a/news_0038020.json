Soccer Football - Championship Play Off Semi Final Second Leg - Aston Villa v Middlesbrough - Villa Park, Birmingham, Britain - May 15, 2018 Aston Villa's John Terry celebrates after the match Action Images via Reuters/Ed Sykes\nSteve Bruce’s side will face Fulham in the final at Wembley as they look to return to the Premier League from which they were relegated in 2016.\nHaving won the semi-final first leg 1-0 courtesy of a Mile Jedinak strike, Villa showed some organised defending to hold off Boro who were looking for an immediate return to the top-flight.\nAt the heart of that defence was former Chelsea and England centre back John Terry who joined the club last year on a free transfer and whose appointment as captain appears to have had a significant impact.\n“(We’ve produced) Two very good performances away and at home tonight. The boys are different class. I think it was important in the first half that we did not concede. Another clean sheet and a great night,” Terry said.

I think our game plan worked very well so the manager deserves a lot credit for that. But the boys have been superb and we’re off to Wembley with one more to go.”\nThe match began with a minute’s applause for former Villa defender Jlloyd Samuel who died earlier on Tuesday at the age of 37 in a car accident.\nBoro created few clear-cut chances but almost levelled the tie late on when Stewart Downing’s 89th-minute free kick from just outside the penalty area rattled the crossbar.

It’s difficult for me to say that but that’s being brutally honest.”\nThe home fans erupted in wild celebrations at fulltime and flooded onto the pitch to join the players.\nThe playoff final will be held at Wembley Stadium on May 26 where Villa will face Fulham who overcame Derby County 2-1 on aggregate on Monday.\nBruce has led two teams through the playoffs to the Premier League but expected a tight encounter against the Londoners.\n“They’re a good football side. They’ve got some good players but, then again, so have we,” he said. “We’re going to Wembley, let’s enjoy it.” Reporting by Christian Radnedge; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:23:49.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
