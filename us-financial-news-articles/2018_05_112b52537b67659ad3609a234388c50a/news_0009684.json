Cuba's First Secretary of the Communist Party and former President Raul Castro (2-R), Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel (2-L), First Secretary of the Communist Party in Havana Lazara Mercedes Lopez (L) and president of the Communist Party of Chile Guillermo Teillier watch the May Day rally in Havana, Cuba, May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\nCuba’s government has been at pains to stress that the historic transition that took place on April 19 does not herald change to one of the world’s last state-run economies and one-party systems, to the frustration of some and relief of others.\nWhile Castro has retired from government, the 86-year-old remains head of the all-powerful Communist Party and speakers at the meticulously state-orchestrated rally referred to him before they did to Diaz-Canel.\nHundreds of thousands paraded at the break of day through Revolution Square to the tune of marching bands, waving Cuban flags and banners reading “United for our Socialism” and “Viva Fidel” in reference to Castro’s late older brother, Fidel Castro.\nTogether, the Castro brothers led Cuba’s 1959 revolution and ruled the island nation for six decades.

NO ARCHIVES\nThe rally was a show of support for the revolution, for Castro “and the continuity of his leadership in the state and government presided by comrade Diaz-Canel,” Ulises Guilarte, of the Cuban Workers’ Confederation, said in a speech.\nStanding side-by-side on a platform under a memorial to independence hero Jose Marti, Castro’s olive green military fatigues and cap contrasted with Diaz-Canel’s casual white shirt and baseball cap. The 58-year-old is the first civilian Cuban leader since the revolution.\nFeting workers, May Day is especially significant in Cuba, which calls itself a worker-governed society. Buses collect demonstrators before dawn for rallies in cities throughout the country and marchers are organised into blocs of neighbours, workers and students.

The average state salary is just $30 per month.\n“It’s the same as every year,” said Lucia, a 45-year-old schoolteacher who declined to give her full name for fear of reprisals, “and we continue to do the same or sometimes worse.” Additional reporting by Nelson Acosta; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Tom Brown", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T21:05:02.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
