I am proud to lead a team whose top priority is serving high-quality, delicious, healthy and affordable home style rotisserie meals to our guests.\"\nAllen added, \"Under George's leadership, Boston Market launched its \"Quality Guarantee,\" which acts as a continued commitment to all guests that Boston Market will serve all-natural and fresh, never frozen, gluten-free, whole chicken with no added hormones, steroids, antibiotics or MSG. In addition, we have become the first national chicken-specialty chain to reach the goal of serving our customers 100 percent antibiotic-free rotisserie chicken. These commitments to transparency, ethical business practices, and quality are critical to building trust and brand loyalty with today's consumer. We will build on the strong legacy that Boston Market has established since the 1990s to further improve our relevance with today's busy families.\"\nAn English native, Allen grew up in the town of Basingstoke.
