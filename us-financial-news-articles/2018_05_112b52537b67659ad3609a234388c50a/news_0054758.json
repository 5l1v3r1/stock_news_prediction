However, they recovered to close up 0.5 percent.\nThe broader FTSE 250 spent most of the session in positive territory and ended the day only 0.07 percent lower thanks to strong earnings.\nElectrocomponents shares led the way, jumping 16.1 percent after the electrical equipment firm raised its dividend and reported double-digit annual profit growth.\nWaste-to-product group Renewi’s shares added 8.2 percent on strong profits while Tate & Lyle rose 7.3 percent after the food ingredients firm reported higher annual profits.\nBritain’s FTSE 100 has been underperforming global stocks recently but analysts are turning more positive on the outlook for UK stocks, including the more domestically-focused markets.\n“The FTSE 100 hit a record high this week, but the bigger story has been one of steady and notable underperformance versus other world equity markets over the last couple of years,” said UBS analysts.\n“We see more interesting opportunities within the market, particularly the domestics,” they added.\nReporting by Helen Reid, Editing by William Maclean and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:15:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
