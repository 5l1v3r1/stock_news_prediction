(3) For a description of net rental revenue run-rate, see the Results of Operations section in the MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018. (4) Contains ancillary income such as parking, laundry and antenna revenue.\nOperating Revenues\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total operating revenues increased by 8.0% compared to the same period last year, due to the contributions from acquisitions, increased same property AMR, and continuing high occupancies. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, ancillary revenues, including parking, laundry and antenna income, increased 4.7% to $8.6 million, compared to the same period last year.\nCAPREIT’s annualized net rental revenue run-rate as at March 31, 2018 grew to $643.8 million, up 8.6% from $592.7 million as at March 31, 2017, primarily due to acquisitions completed within the last twelve months and strong increases in AMR on properties owned prior to March 31, 2017. Net rental revenue run-rate net of dispositions for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 was $617.2 million (2017 – $572.6 million).\nPortfolio Average Monthly Rents Total Portfolio Properties Owned Prior\nto March 31, 2017\nAs at March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (1)\nAMR Occ. % AMR Occ. % AMR Occ. % AMR Occ. % Average Residential Suites $ 1,153 98.7 $ 1,105 98.6 $ 1,151 98.8 $ 1,105 98.6 Average MHC Land Lease Sites $ 391 98.2 $ 381 98.4 $ 391 98.2 $ 381 98.4 Overall Portfolio Average $ 1,054 98.6 $ 1,007 98.6 $ 1,048 98.7 $ 1,007 98.6\n(1) Prior period comparable AMR and occupancy have been restated for properties disposed of since March 31, 2017.\nOverall AMR for the stabilized residential suite portfolio (properties owned prior to March 31, 2017) increased 4.2% to $1,151 at March 31, 2018 from $1,105 at March 31, 2017. The increases were due primarily to a combination of ongoing successful sales and marketing strategies, above guideline rent increases, suite and building improvements, and continued strength in the residential rental sector in the majority of CAPREIT's regional markets. Occupancy for the stabilized residential suite portfolio increased to 98.8% as at March 31, 2018 compared to 98.6% for the same period last year.\nFor the total MHC land lease portfolio, AMR increased to $391 as at March 31, 2018, compared to $381 as at March 31, 2017 while occupancy remained strong at 98.2%. Management believes MHC land lease sites provide secure and stable cash flows due to long-term tenancies, high occupancies, steady increases in AMR, and significantly lower capital and maintenance costs.\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change in AMR % Turnovers Change in AMR % Turnovers $ % & Renewals (1) $ % & Renewals (1) Suite Turnovers 109.0 9.6 4.2 44.7 4.0 4.4 Lease Renewals 25.8 2.2 16.7 20.6 1.8 16.8 Weighted Average of Turnovers and Renewals 42.5 3.7 25.6 2.3\n(1) Percentage of suites turned over or renewed during the period based on the total number of residential suites (excluding co-ownerships and the Netherland properties) held at the end of the period.\nOverall, suite turnovers in the residential suite portfolio (excluding co-ownerships and The Netherlands properties) during the three months ended March 31, 2018 resulted in AMR increasing by approximately $109 or 9.6% compared to an increase of approximately $45 or 4.0% for the same period last year, primarily due to the strong rental markets of British Columbia and Ontario, offset by strategically reduced rents in the Alberta rental markets to increase occupancy and decrease in rents in Saskatchewan due to lower occupancy.\nPursuant to Management’s focus on increasing overall portfolio rents for the three months ended March 31, 2018, AMR on lease renewals increased by approximately $26 or 2.2%, compared to an increase of approximately $21 or 1.8% for the same period last year. Increased portfolio diversification helped mitigate geographical risk in particular areas of Canada. Management continues to pursue applications for annual guideline increases (“AGIs”) in Ontario, where it believes increases to raise AMR on lease renewals above the annual guideline are supported by market conditions. For 2018, the permitted guideline increases in Ontario and British Columbia have been set at 1.8% and 4.0% respectively, up from 1.5% and 3.7% last year.\nOperating Expenses For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 % (1) 2017 % (1) ($ Thousands) Operating Expenses Realty Taxes $ 17,332 10.3 $ 17,176 11.0 Utilities 18,650 11.1 18,730 12.0 Other (2) 29,635 17.6 28,106 18.1 Total Operating Expenses $ 65,617 39.0 $ 64,012 41.1\n(1) As a percentage of total operating revenues. (2) Comprises R&M, wages, general and administrative, insurance, advertising, and legal costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOverall operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues improved to 39.0% from 41.1% for the same period last year due primarily to the increased size of the portfolio.\nNOI\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, NOI increased by $10.8 million or 11.8%, and the NOI margin strengthened to 60.9% compared to 58.9% for the same period last year. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, operating revenues for stabilized suites and sites increased 3.9%, while operating expenses were lower by 0.4%, compared to the same period last year. As a result, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, stabilized NOI increased by 7.0% compared to the same period last year, showing the positive effects of CAPREIT’s geographic diversification across Canada and its proven property management programs.\nNON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 NFFO (000s) $ 64,095 $ 57,937 NFFO Per Unit – Basic $ 0.463 $ 0.429 Cash Distributions Declared Per Unit $ 0.320 $ 0.315 NFFO Payout Ratio 70.4% 74.5% NFFO Effective Payout Ratio 50.3% 50.1%\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, basic NFFO per Unit increased 7.9% compared to the same period last year despite the approximate 2.6% increase in the weighted average number of Units outstanding, due primarily to strong organic NOI growth and contributions from acquisitions.\nLIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE\nAs at March 31, 2018 2017 Total Debt to Gross Book Value 41.48% 43.99% Total Debt to Gross Historical Cost (1) 53.77% 54.51% Total Debt to Total Capitalization 42.00% 43.73% Debt Service Coverage Ratio (times) (2) 1.64 1.63 Interest Coverage Ratio (times) (2) 3.22 3.12 Weighted Average Mortgage Interest Rate (3) 3.07% 3.20% Weighted Average Mortgage Term to Maturity (years) 5.45 5.90\n(1) Based on the historical cost of investment properties. (2) Based on the trailing four quarters ended March 31, 2018. (3) Weighted average mortgage interest rate includes deferred financing costs and fair value adjustments on an effective interest basis. Including the amortization of the realized component of the loss on settlement of $32.5 million included in AOCL, the effective portfolio weighted average interest rate at March 31, 2018 would be 3.17% (March 31, 2017 - 3.3%).\nFinancial Strength\nManagement believes CAPREIT’s strong balance sheet and liquidity position will enable it to continue to take advantage of acquisition and property capital investment opportunities over the long term.\nCAPREIT is achieving its financing goals as demonstrated by the following key indicators:\nTotal debt to gross book value ratio strengthened to 41.48% as at March 31, 2018 compared to 43.99% for the same period last year; Debt service and interest coverage ratio improved to 1.64 times and 3.22 times, respectively, compared to 1.63 times and 3.12 times for the same period last year; As at March 31, 2018, 97.3% (March 31, 2017 – 95.9%) of CAPREIT’s mortgage portfolio was insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (“CMHC”), excluding the mortgages on CAPREIT’s MHC land lease sites and Euro LIBOR borrowings, resulting in improved spreads on mortgages and lower overall interest costs than conventional mortgages. The effective portfolio weighted average interest rate on mortgages has steadily declined to 3.07% as at March 31, 2018 from 3.20% as at March 31, 2017, resulting in significant potential interest rate savings in future years; Management expects to raise between $175 million and $225 million in total mortgage renewals and refinancings for 2018 excluding financings on acquisitions; The weighted average term to maturity of the mortgage portfolio was 5.45 years as at March 31, 2018 compared to 5.90 years at March 31, 2017; As at March 31, 2018, CAPREIT has investment properties with a fair value of $306.3 million not encumbered by mortgages and securing only the Acquisition and Operating Facility. CAPREIT intends to maintain unencumbered investment properties with an aggregate fair value in the range of $150 and $180 million over the long term.\nProperty Capital Investments\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, CAPREIT made property capital investments (excluding head office assets) of $28.2 million, compared to $30.8 million for the same period last year. In 2018, CAPREIT expects to complete property capital investments (excluding development and intensification) of approximately $185 million to $195 million.\nProperty capital investments include suite improvements, common areas and equipment, which generally tend to increase NOI more quickly. CAPREIT continues to invest in environment-friendly and energy-saving initiatives, including high-efficiency boilers, energy-efficient lighting systems and water saving programs, which have permitted CAPREIT to mitigate potential increases in utility and R&M costs and have improved overall portfolio NOI significantly.\nSubsequent Event\nOn April 24, 2018, CAPREIT completed the acquisition of a property comprising of 134 MHC sites located in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The purchase price of $5.65 million was financed with CAPREIT’s Acquisition and Operating credit facility.\nOn May 8, 2018, CAPREIT announced that its Board of Trustees had approved a 3.9% increase in monthly cash distributions to $0.1108 per Unit, or $1.33 per Unit on an annualized basis. The increase is effective with the May 2018 distribution payable on June 15, 2018 to Unitholders of record as at May 31, 2018.\nAdditional Information\nMore detailed information and analysis is included in CAPREIT's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which have been filed on SEDAR and can be viewed at www.sedar.com under CAPREIT’s profile or on CAPREIT’s website on the investor relations page at www.caprent.com or www.capreit.net .\nConference Call\nA conference call hosted by David Ehrlich, President and CEO and the CAPREIT Management Team, will be held Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 10:00 am EST.

In this and other earnings releases and investor conference calls, as a complement to results provided in accordance with IFRS, CAPREIT also discloses and discusses certain financial measures not recognized under IFRS and that do not have standard meanings prescribed by IFRS. These include stabilized net rental income (“Stabilized NOI”), Funds From Operations (“FFO”), Normalized Funds From Operations (“NFFO”), Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (“ACFO”), FFO and NFFO per Unit amounts and FFO, NFFO and ACFO payout ratios, and Adjusted Cash Generated from Operating Activities (collectively, the “Non-IFRS Measures”). These Non-IFRS Measures are further defined and discussed in the MD&A released on May 8, 2018, which should be read in conjunction with this press release. Since these measures are not recognized under IFRS, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other issuers. CAPREIT has presented the Non-IFRS measures because Management believes these Non-IFRS measures are relevant measures of the ability of CAPREIT to earn revenue and to evaluate CAPREIT’s performance and cash flows. A reconciliation of these Non-IFRS measures to the comparable IFRS measures, along with further definitions and discussion, is included in this press release. The Non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with IFRS as indicators of CAPREIT’s performance or sustainability of our distributions.\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained, or contained in documents incorporated by reference, in this press release constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws.

Although the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions, Management believes they are reasonable as of the date hereof; however there can be no assurance actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements, and they may prove to be incorrect. Forward-looking statements necessarily involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond CAPREIT’s control, that may cause CAPREIT or the industry’s actual results, performance, achievements, prospects and opportunities in future periods to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
