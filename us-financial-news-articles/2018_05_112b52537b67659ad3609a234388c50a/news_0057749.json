A judge in California had ruled that her son Leo should not leave the state until custody was resolved.\nAfter losing the first set, Azarenka showed signs of a comeback, winning a fierce-hitting baseline exchange to go to 2-2. But she was unable to build momentum even as her Czech opponent lost her cool over a handful of disputed line calls.\nFormer world number one Azarenka has endured a tough return to Europe’s clay courts, losing in the second round at the Madrid Open before being dumped out of the first round in Rome. She is currently ranked 84 in the world.\nThe months-long custody fight over her son Leo has been a painful distraction for Azarenka, and the 28-year-old said she had been looking forward to her return to Paris.\n“Ah Paris, we love each other, no?,” She tweeted earlier this month.\nIn an open letter posted on social media last year, Azarenka said no one should ever have to decide between a child and their career.\nAzarenka won the Australian Open in 2012 and 2013. Her best performance at Roland Garros was in 2013 when she lost in the semi-finals to Russia’s Maria Sharapova. She has said she will play at Wimbledon this year.
