(“ Northland ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:NPI) today reported financial results .\n“2018 is off to an excellent start,” said John Brace, Chief Executive Officer. “Northland’s Hai Long 2 offshore wind project in Taiwan was allocated 300 MW under Taiwan’s Feed-In Tariff program, our operating assets are performing well, and construction on our Deutsche Bucht offshore wind project continues on schedule. We achieved a 250% increase in free cash flow per share and a 47% increase in adjusted EBITDA over the same quarter last year. We continue to focus on generating disciplined growth and robust shareholder returns.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nFinancial\nSales increased 34% or $122.3 million to $486.4 million and gross profit increased 41% or $131.5 million to $454.6 million compared to the same quarter last year primarily due to Nordsee One reaching full commercial operations in December 2017 and higher wind resources at Gemini, partially offset by the expiry of Kingston’s power purchase agreement ( PPA ) in January 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) increased 47% or $92.3 million to $290.4 million compared to the same quarter last year primarily due to contributions from Nordsee One and Gemini, partially offset by the expiry of Kingston’s PPA. Free cash flow per share (a non-IFRS measure) increased 250% or $0.60 to $0.84 compared to the same quarter last year primarily as a result of contributions from Gemini’s and Nordsee One’s operations partially offset by Kingston and the commencement of scheduled principal repayments for Gemini and Nordsee One. Net income increased 78% or $77.8 million to $178.0 million compared to the same quarter last year primarily due to higher operating income from Gemini and Nordsee One partially offset by a non-cash fair value loss on derivative contracts ($2.8 million loss compared to a $29.4 million gain in the first quarter of 2017) and an $11.6 million increase in the provision for current taxes.\nSales and net income, as reported under IFRS, include consolidated results of entities not wholly-owned by Northland, whereas the above non-IFRS measures, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, only include Northland’s proportionate interest.\nDevelopment and Construction\nHai Long 2 – 300 MW offshore wind project, Taiwan Strait – On April 30, 2018, the Bureau of Energy of Taiwan allocated 300 MW (180 MW net to Northland) to the Hai Long 2 offshore wind project (“ Hai Long 2 ”) under Taiwan’s Feed-in-Tariff (“ FIT ”) program. This is a significant milestone for the project, located approximately 50 km off the coast of Taiwan, as it allocates capacity for Hai Long 2 to connect to Taiwan’s grid in 2024, and advances the project’s ability to execute a 20-year power contract under Taiwan’s FIT program. Northland and its partner Yushan Energy Pte. Ltd. (“ Yushan ”) have economic interests of 60% and 40% in Hai Long 2, respectively.\nDeutsche Bucht – 252 MW offshore wind project, German North Sea – The Deutsche Bucht offshore wind project is progressing according to schedule and budget. Manufacturing of the main components is on schedule and the first offshore activities have been completed. Offshore installations will commence in the second half of 2018 with project completion expected by the end of 2019. The total estimated project cost is approximately €1.3 billion.\nOther\nAppointment of John Brace to Northland’s Board of Directors – On April 4, 2018, Northland expanded its Board of Directors from six to seven members and appointed Chief Executive Officer, John W. Brace, to the Board. Mr. Brace has been with Northland since 1988 and has served as Northland’s Chief Executive Officer since 2005.\nSummary of Consolidated Results (in thousands of dollars, except per share amounts) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 FINANCIALS Sales $ 486,372 $ 364,051 Gross profit 454,557 323,082 Operating income 281,154 187,632 Net income (loss) 177,955 100,112 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 290,421 198,117 Cash provided by operating activities 289,765 276,705 Free cash flow (1) 148,047 41,548 Cash dividends paid to common and class A shareholders 39,131 33,555 Total dividends declared (2)\n52,755 46,805 Per share information Net income (loss) - basic $ 0.61 $ 0.30 Free cash flow - basic (1) $ 0.84 $ 0.24 Total dividends declared (2) $ 0.30 $ 0.27 ENERGY VOLUMES Electricity production in gigawatt hours ( GWh ) (3) 2,327 1,894 (1) Refer to the Non-IFRS Financial Measures section of this press release for additional information.

(3) For 2017, includes Gemini and Nordsee One pre-completion production volumes. Refer to SECTION 4.1 Operating Facilities’ Results of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis , for additional information. First Quarter Results Summary\nOffshore wind facilities\nElectricity production , including pre-completion production, increased 60% or 380 GWh compared to the first quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to all of Nordsee One’s turbines producing power in the first quarter of 2018, whereas the project was under construction last year.\nSales and adjusted EBITDA of $316.1 million and $186.5 million, respectively, reflect an increase of $138.7 million and $90.6 million compared to the same quarter last year primarily as a result of Nordsee One reaching full commercial operations in December 2017 and higher wind resources at Gemini compared to the same quarter last year. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations resulted in $45.5 million higher revenue compared to the same quarter last year.\nThermal facilities\nElectricity production increased 6% or 55 GWh compared to the first quarter of last year primarily due to higher production at Thorold and North Battleford, partially offset by the impact of the expiration of Kingston’s PPA in January 2017.\nWhile sales of $116.6 million decreased $14.6 million compared to the same quarter last year largely due to the impact of the expiration of the Kingston PPA, operating income and adjusted EBITDA of $64.3 million and $78.0 million, respectively, decreased $5.4 million and $3.9 million primarily as a result of improved margins from lower natural gas costs compared to the same quarter last year.\nOn-shore renewable facilities\nElectricity production of 388 GWh was comparable to the first quarter of last year. Sales for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $53.7 million or $1.8 million lower than the same quarter last year primarily due to the sale of the German wind farms in November 2017 and lower production at McLean’s and Grand Bend.\nAs a result of these factors, operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the renewable facilities were lower by $1.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) costs\nG&A costs (previously reported as management and administration costs) of $16.9 million were $7.0 million lower than the first quarter of last year, of which corporate G&A costs were $6.8 million lower primarily due to the timing of early-stage development activities as well as the certain non-recurring personnel costs incurred last year. Facility G&A costs decreased $0.2 million primarily due to lower costs at Nordsee One and Gemini, partially offset by incremental costs at Deutsche Bucht.\nFinance costs\nFinance costs, net, increased $4.8 million compared to the first quarter of last year primarily due to interest costs at Nordsee One no longer being capitalized following completion of construction activities.\nFair value loss on derivative contracts\nFair value loss on derivative contracts was $2.8 million compared to a $29.4 million gain in the first quarter of last year primarily due to the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\nForeign exchange gain\nForeign exchange gain of $15.1 million is primarily due to the realized gain on a foreign exchange contract settled this quarter ($5.9 million) combined with unrealized gains from favourable closing foreign exchange rate.\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense decreased $17.6 million compared to the first quarter of last year primarily due to a $2.4 million gain on sale of Northland’s interest in the idled Cochrane thermal facility in March 2018 and the one-time $14.6 million (€10.4 million) contingent consideration expensed last year in connection with the acquisition of Gemini.\nNet income\nThe factors described above resulted in net income of $178.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $100.1 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of $290.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 was $92.3 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. The significant factors increasing adjusted EBITDA were:\n$69.5 million as a result of Nordsee One reaching full commercial operations in December 2017; $21.8 million as a result of higher wind production at Gemini; $5.8 million decrease in corporate G&A costs primarily related to the timing of early-stage development projects; and $2.3 million higher operating income from Northland’s other operating facilities.\nFactors partially offsetting the increase in adjusted EBITDA include:\n$6.4 million decrease in operating income as a result of the expiration of the PPA at Kingston in January 2017.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow of $148.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 was $106.5 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. Significant factors increasing free cash flow were:\n$192.3 million increase due to Gemini and Nordsee One reaching full commercial operations in 2017; $5.4 million from Gemini interest income on the subordinated debt (excluded from free cash flow until commencement of cash interest payments in the third quarter of 2017); and $5.8 million decrease in corporate G&A costs primarily related to the timing of early-stage development projects.\nFactors decreasing free cash flow were:\n$48.0 million increase in scheduled principal repayments related to Gemini and Nordsee One debt; $29.4 million increase in net interest expense due to the inclusion of Gemini and Norsdsee One debt; $10.6 million increase in current taxes related to Nordsee One; and $6.4 million decrease in operating income due to the expiration of the PPA at Kingston in January 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the rolling four quarter free cash flow net payout ratio was 38.6%, calculated on the basis of cash dividends paid, and 53.4% calculated on the basis of total dividends, compared to 57.3% and 77.5%, respectively, last year. The improvement in the free cash flow payout ratios from last year was primarily due to contributions from Gemini and Nordsee One.\nOutlook\nNorthland actively pursues new power development opportunities that encompass a range of clean technologies, including natural gas, wind, solar and hydro.\nAs of May 9, 2018, Northland continues to expect adjusted EBITDA in 2018 to be in the range of $860 to $930 million and free cash flow per share in 2018 to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.00. Refer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in Northland’s 2017 Annual Report for additional information on Northland’s outlook for 2018.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis press release includes references to Northland’s adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and applicable payout ratio and per share amounts, which are not measures prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and applicable payout ratio and per share amounts do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and, as presented, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income, cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Rather, these measures are provided to complement IFRS measures in the analysis of Northland’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and applicable payout ratio and per share amounts are widely accepted financial indicators used by investors to assess the performance of a company and its ability to generate cash through operations.
