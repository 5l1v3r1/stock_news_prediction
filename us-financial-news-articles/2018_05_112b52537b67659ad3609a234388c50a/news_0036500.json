Each year, older Americans lose roughly $36.5 billion to fraud, according to 2015 estimates from retirement planning site True Link.\nAdditionally, a year-over-year increase in the number of cases and complaints involving senior financial fraud and exploitation was reported last year by 29 percent of state securities regulators, according to the North American Securities Administrators Association.\nIn conjunction with the trusted contact requirement issued in February, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority also began allowing brokers to put a temporary hold on a requested account withdrawal if financial exploitation is suspected.\nIn that kind of situation, the broker could reach out to the trusted contact with their concerns.\nElder financial fraud cases Issue Percentage of cases reported Third-party abuse/exploitation 27% Account distributions 26% Family member, trustee or power of attorney taking advantage 23% Diminished capacity 12% Combined diminished capacity and third-party abuse 12% Fraud 6.30% Elder exploitation 5.70% Friend, housekeeper or caretaker taking advantage Excessive withdrawals SOURCE: North American Securities Administrators Association While clients are not required to provide a trusted contact, brokers must ask if they want to name one. All new accounts must include the option.\nMany brokerages have already begun alerting existing clients about the change. Some firms let you name a trusted contact online, while others are discussing the choice with clients in person.\n\"We believe the best approach is to have a conversation about the trusted contact opportunity with each client, as it can lead to important information about our clients — family relationship dynamics, for example — that can help us more deeply serve their needs,\" said John Ellis, a principal with Edward Jones.\nshow chapters Almost half of Americans don't expect to have enough to retire comfortably 11:30 AM ET Mon, 14 May 2018 | 01:04 When you mull over who could fill that role, consider who has good judgement and would know how to handle the responsibility — and respect your privacy — if they have to step in.\n\"Don't just pick your oldest child because the child is your oldest,\" Alaimo said.\nIn fact, she said, the person doesn't even need to be family.\n\"It could be your attorney or accountant or another third-party professional,\" Alaimo said. \"If you do that, the person also has accountability … for ethical behavior.\"\nShe also said that while the rule is aimed at preventing elderly fraud, the time to name a trusted contact is before you reach a point where your own judgment is slipping.\nMore from Investor Toolkit:\nThese costly estate planning mistakes can be fixed\nMoney lessons learned from pro athletes' financial fouls\nMillennials: Here's what to consider before you dive into a health savings account\nIn other words, you don't want to inadvertently name someone who actually could be poised to take advantage of you.\n\"What the rule is trying to accomplish is all good stuff,\" Alaimo said. \"But the danger is that sometimes an older person can trust someone — like a caregiver — when that is the very person that could end up harming them financially.\"\nIt also is a good idea, she said, to tell your family about the trusted contact.\n\"You might be better off being transparent about that selection so everyone knows who's going to be contacted,\" Alaimo said. \"It might also discourage anyone from trying to do something wrong if they know a trusted contact is in effect on your account.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T17:28:43.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
