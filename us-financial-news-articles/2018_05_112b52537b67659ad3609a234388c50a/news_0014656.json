The Company's presentation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. This financial measure is intended to provide additional information to investors concerning the Company's performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and is a measure of a company's operating performance. Essentially, it's a way to evaluate a company's performance without having to factor in financing decisions, accounting decisions or tax environments. The following table shows the Company’s Non-IFRS measure (EBITDA) reconciled to net income for the indicated periods:\nGross $USD % Net Income % $ 2,341,000 17 % Adjustments % (Income Tax, Depreciation, Interest, and Stock Compensation) $ 1,421,000 10 % Adjusted EBITDA % $ 3,762,000 27 % Management uses this non-GAAP measure as a key metric in the evaluation of the Company's performance and the consolidated financial results. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors in their assessment of the operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, this non-GAAP measure addresses questions the Company routinely receives from analysts and investors and, in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data, the Company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. However, non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource:Viemed Healthcare, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=J5gZsI_NsM6BYbjlrkohZ1ZesEzUff_Gk-O15uMiiQOG2gpYJMqxZdnmKY8t0orNxKO81Rc-aNo4exE-8JW9BQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/454cd567-87d2-498b-80e1-644b1104411f"], "published": "2018-05-08T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:50:47.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
