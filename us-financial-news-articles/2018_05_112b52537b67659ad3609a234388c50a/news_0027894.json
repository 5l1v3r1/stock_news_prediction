State-run lender Pekao is considering a merger with rival Alior Bank.\nWhen asked if he expects more deals Sikora said:\n“Yes, I do expect it, although I’m not talking about us”\n“My experience in banking tells me that one can not be sure about timing - if this happens this year exactly or maybe a bit later, of course. Consolidation in the Polish banking sector will continue,” Sikora said.
