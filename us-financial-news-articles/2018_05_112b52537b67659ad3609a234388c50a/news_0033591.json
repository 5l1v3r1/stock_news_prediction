REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh Security sources said at least 22 people were detained by police during “limited and sporadic protests” on Saturday at several metro stations by commuters demanding the price hikes be reversed. They said most had been released, while three were ordered detained for 24 hours pending further investigation.\nThe government says higher fares are needed to keep the loss-making metro running and to finance new extensions being built to serve more of the capital city’s 25 million people. It has also committed to sharply reducing state subsidies as part of a 2016 loan deal with the International Monetary Fund, pushing up living costs for millions of Egyptians.\nThe price rises, which came into effect on Friday, saw the cost of some metro tickets tripled.\n“The (price) increase will generate about 1 billion pounds ($56.37 million),” Transportation Minister Hesham Arafat told private television channel Sada al-Balad late on Saturday.\n“Without this billion (pounds), I cannot continue, the metro company cannot continue.”\nPeople wait to board a train at El Sadat metro station in the center of Cairo, Egypt May 13, 2018.

Metro staff sought to encourage travelers to purchase lower cost monthly tickets.\nVideos posted on social media on Saturday showed people jumping over ticket barriers at some stations. At others, dozens of protesters chanted slogans as police looked on.\nA Reuters witness said police detained at least two people after scuffles at one of the stations.\nInterior Ministry officials could not be reached for comment. It was not possible to verify the authenticity of the recordings.\nInflation shot up after Egypt devalued its currency in November 2016, reaching a record high in July on the back of energy subsidy cuts.\nIt then eased gradually until last month, when core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food, rose slightly.\n($1 = 17.7400 Egyptian pounds)\nEditing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T15:56:47.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
