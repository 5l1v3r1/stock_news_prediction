But once you got your data infrastructure well set up, it really is something you can deal with.\"\nIn fact, he said: \"It might be a competitive advantage because the companies will probably be more trustworthy. On the other hand, they'll have higher compliance cost.\"\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come into force on May 25. It will require businesses to be more upfront about the information they hold on people. Users would be able to ask companies for the information they hold on them, and firms will have to provide those for free. Users will also have more control over how their data is used by companies. Netherlands wants to be a gateway to Europe\nPrince Constantijn explained that the Netherlands, which is positioning itself as a center for innovation, has many advantages that could attract potential companies and investors looking to expand into Europe.\nThose include good tax rules, an open economy and availability of talent and capital.\nThe prince is also a special envoy to a Dutch accelerator called StartupDelta, which was created to promote start-ups in the Netherlands, connect them to investors, and provide them with access to capital, talent and technology.\nStartupDelta plans to help Dutch start-ups move abroad into newer markets like Southeast Asia, he said.\n\"Singapore is a very good place to start your journey,\" he said, referring to the city-state as a gateway to the broader Southeast Asian region.\n\"So we're looking really at seeing how we can establish ourselves here, supporting companies that are going out here,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T07:15:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
