CVC Capital Partners has a 29 percent stake, with Summit Partners holding 7 percent.\nThe security software services provider had already planned a U.S. IPO in 2012 before backtracking citing market conditions.\nThe listing is expected to be the biggest by market capitalisation in London since July when the floatation of Russian gold company Polyus gave it a 6.3 billion pound market value.
