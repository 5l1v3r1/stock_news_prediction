I just can’t believe it.\n“I was wondering if I would ever win it.\n“My career, I’ve had so many wins, so many poles but everyone always talks about the 500 and I just couldn’t imagine winning a race in front of a crowd like this.”\nPatrick left her mark on the two biggest and most popular motorsport series in North America, IndyCar and NASCAR, but she could not deliver the Hollywood ending to a story that just might one day end up on the silver screen.\nAnnouncing last November that she would retire, Patrick planned to bring down the curtain on her career with the “Danica Double”, contesting the Daytona and Indy 500s.\nAs far as swansongs go, February’s Daytona 500 was a bust ending in a wreck. The Indy 500 promised the possibility of something special but in the end finished in the exact same way.\nDuring a 14-year career split between IndyCar and NASCAR it was the Indy 500 that provided most of Patrick’s career highlights and made her one of North America’s most recognizable athletes.\nHer third-place finish in 2009 remains the best-ever result by a woman in the Indy 500 while her resume also includes a fourth in 2005 (her rookie debut) and sixth in 2006.\n“I’ve had a lot of good fortune here and did still have some this month,” said Patrick. “It just didn’t come on race day but we had some good moments.”\nCastroneves, who has moved over to race sports cars for Penske and no longer competes on the IndyCar series, has also made his name at the Brickyard with trips to Victory Lane in 2001, 2002 and 2009.\nIn more than a century of racing at the famed speedway only three men — A.J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr. and Rick Mears — have finished the 500 on Victory Lane four times and Sunday’s race may have been Castroneves’s last shot at joining them.\nPenske had said earlier that he would bring Castroneves back for a shot at a record-smashing fifth Indy 500 if the 43-year-old could get his fourth but now his Indy future is in question.\n“Please Roger I’ve got to come back,” pleaded Castroneves soon after he climbed out of his wreck.
