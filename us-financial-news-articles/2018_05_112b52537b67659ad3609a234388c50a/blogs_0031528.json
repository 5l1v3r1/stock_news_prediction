That prompted Icahn and Deason, who control 15 percent of the company, to demand changes to the board.\nThe settlement with the billionaire investors outlined by Xerox on Sunday puts the Japanese company further on the back foot in any new negotiations with Xerox, although a number of analysts have said Fujifilm is under no pressure to rush.\nXerox said it had repeatedly tried to convince Fujifilm to start talks on improved terms for buyout to no avail. Fujifilm said on Sunday it disputed Xerox's right to terminate the deal and would look at all options including legal action seeking damages.\nIcahn and Deason have said they believe other investors are \"waiting in the wings\" for Xerox, while people familiar with the matter have previously said that buyout firm Apollo Global Management has expressed interest in a bid for Xerox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T12:43:27.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
