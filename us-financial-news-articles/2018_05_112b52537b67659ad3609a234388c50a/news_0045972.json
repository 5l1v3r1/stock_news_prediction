According to the release, auditions will be held over the summer for stunt artists, tumblers, acrobats and cheerleaders as part of the new group.\nRumors about the decision started circulating on social media over the weekend after ESPN San Antonio radio host Jason Mannix posted a tweet saying the dancers “are no more” because of “lack of fan interest.”\nFans have seemingly not wholeheartedly endorsed the change, as #bringbackthechaps began making the rounds on social media. One former Silver Dancer, Michelle Vogel, posted a reply to Mannix’s tweet and post on Facebook, debunking any “lack of fan interest” and instead questioning the team for cracking in the face of the #MeToo movement.\n“Does ‘lack of interest’ really mean ‘we don’t want to deal with it,’” she posted.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:19:28.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
