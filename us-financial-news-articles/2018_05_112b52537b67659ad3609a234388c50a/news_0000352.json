Saudi Basic Industries was down 0.4 percent.\nThe Saudi index has eased off from a more than two-year high hit last week and consolidating at current levels, while Dubai is stabilising after being weighed down by property stocks due to the emirate’s weak real estate market.\nShares of Emaar Properties were up 0.5 percent in early trade, although Dubai’s benchmark index was flat.\n“Local markets need a major catalyst to get it moving again and if things don’t change soon then we are probably moving into a very slow month into Ramadan and summer season,” said Marie Salem, director of capital markets at FFA Dubai.\nIn Qatar the benchmark index fell 1 percent in early trade, weighed by blue chips. Industries Qatar was down 0.6 pct and Qatar National dropped 1.3 percent.\nBoth stocks have seen double-digit gains this year following decisions to increase foreign ownership limits to 49 percent from 25 percent. The higher ceilings are aimed at lifting stocks’ weight in emerging market indexes.
