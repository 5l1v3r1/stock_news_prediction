(“BTI”) (Nasdaq:BTAI), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical development company utilizing novel artificial intelligence to identify the next wave of medicines across neuroscience and immuno-oncology, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, and provided an update on key strategic and operational initiatives.\n“The first quarter of 2018 was a transformational period for our company. We successfully completed our initial public offering (IPO), strengthening our balance sheet and providing capital to advance our drug candidates through clinical trials. We are grateful for the support of our investors as we advance our lead programs, BXCL501 in neuroscience and BXCL701 in immuno-oncology,” commented Vimal Mehta, President and Chief Executive Officer of BTI.\n“Building on this momentum, we are continuing to advance our BXCL501 program through the ongoing trial of the IV formulation of dexmedetomidine (“Dex”) and plan to initiate a second IV Dex study for the acute treatment of agitation in schizophrenic patients. We expect to report data from both Phase 1b studies in the second half of 2018. Following data, we intend to commence Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept open label clinical trials using the IV formulation of Dex for both programs before year-end, and a bridging bioavailability / bioequivalence study using our sublingual thin film formulation of Dex, BXCL501, which we expect will support initiation of a registration trial anticipated in 2019.\nDr. Mehta added, “We are also making significant progress in the development of BXCL701, our oral small molecule immunomodulator. We are planning to initiate Phase 2 proof of concept studies in pancreatic cancer and treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer (tNEPC) later this year. We are also evaluating BXCL701’s potential in additional indications, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other immuno-oncology agents. We believe that its novel mechanism of action, DPP 8/9 and FAP inhibition, makes it a promising therapy in the treatment of a variety of tumor types.”\nDr. Mehta concluded, “We have an exciting opportunity ahead of us through our relationship with BioXcel Corporation. Its artificial intelligence-based discovery platform is expected to be an invaluable tool as we advance our clinical programs and identify emerging pipeline candidates. Through this relationship, we expect to have the ability to leverage thousands of compounds and disease targets to expand our pipeline with the addition of innovative treatment regimens that we can develop quickly, at a lower cost, and with a high probability of success. Since completion of our IPO, we have been building our corporate operations team and expanding scientific, clinical, manufacturing, quality, regulatory and R&D staff to support our future growth and the advancement of both our clinical and pipeline programs.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nCompleted IPO and began trading on Nasdaq Capital Market, raising gross proceeds of $60.0 million; Announced acceptance of poster presentation on preclinical data for combination of BXCL701 and Nektar Therapeutics’ NKTR-214 in pancreatic cancer at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nBTI reported a net loss of $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $0.5 million for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a ramp-up of research and development costs including a one-time previously agreed $1.0 million payment to BioXcel Corporation in connection with BTI’s IPO, along with increased personnel expenses associated with BTI’s two main drug candidates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to additional payroll and payroll-related expenses and costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $55.5 million.\nAbout BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc.:\nBioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on drug development that utilizes novel artificial intelligence to identify the next wave of medicines across neuroscience and immuno-oncology.
