REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Sohrab “Sam” Sharma, Robert Farkas and Raymond Trapani, who co-founded Centra Tech Inc, were each charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and two conspiracy counts, according to an indictment filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.\nProsecutors said the defendants, who live in Florida, misled investors in Centra tokens that they had formed partnerships with Visa Inc ( V.N ), MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ) and Delaware-based The Bancorp Inc ( TBBK.O ) to issue debit cards, lied about having money transmitter licenses and created a fictitious chief executive officer.\nLawyers for the three defendants could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe three men were arrested last month and the FBI seized 91,000 “Ether units” consisting of digital funds currently worth $60 million, according to a release announcing the indictment.\nAuthorities around the world have attempted to rein in the global boom in trading cryptocurrencies - a form of digital money created and maintained by its users.\n“As alleged, the defendants conspired to capitalize on investor interest in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market,”\nDeputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami said in the release. “Whether traditional or cutting-edge, investment vehicles can’t legally be peddled with falsehoods and lies.”\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel and Nathan Layne in New York; Editing by James Dalgleish and Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
