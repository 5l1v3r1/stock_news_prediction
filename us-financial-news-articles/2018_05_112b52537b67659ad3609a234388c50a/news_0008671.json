(NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst quarter revenues of $5.6 billion increased 21 percent from the same quarter in 2017. Strong demand for trucks, construction and mining equipment drove the majority of the revenue increase. Currency favorably impacted revenues by 2 percent, primarily due to a weaker US dollar.\nSales in North America improved by 22 percent while international revenues increased by 20 percent led by strong growth in Europe, Latin America, China and India.\n“Improving demand in a number of the Company’s core markets, combined with our strong global market share and the success of new products aimed at lowering emissions, resulted in sales growth of 21 percent in the first quarter,” said Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $187 million for the expected costs of a product campaign. This campaign is part of a proactive plan to address the performance of an aftertreatment component in certain on-highway products produced between 2010 and 2015 in North America. The Company is in the process of finalizing the details of the campaign and, as is customary, the campaign is subject to regulatory approval.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the first quarter were $700 million, or 12.6 percent of sales, down from $705 million or 15.4 percent of sales a year ago. Excluding the impact of the campaign charge, EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $887 million or 15.9 percent of sales.\nNet income attributable to Cummins in the first quarter was $325 million ($1.96 per diluted share), compared to $396 million ($2.36 per diluted share). First quarter results included $78 million in discrete tax charges, primarily related to U.S. tax reform. Excluding the discrete tax charges, net income attributable to Cummins in the first quarter was $403 million ($2.43 per diluted share), reflecting a 23 percent tax rate.\n“Cummins delivered solid operating performance in the first quarter led by strong incremental margins in the Power Systems segment,” continued Linebarger. “As a result of rising demand and continued benefits from cost reduction initiatives, we have raised our full year outlook for sales and EBITDA.”\nBased on the current forecast, Cummins expects full year 2018 revenues to be up 10 to 14 percent, compared to prior guidance of up 4 to 8 percent. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 15.4 to 15.8 percent of sales, down from 15.8 to 16.2 percent of sales. Excluding the impact of the first quarter charge for the product campaign, full year EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 16.2 to 16.6 percent, reflecting strong incremental EBITDA of 28 percent at the midpoint, compared to 2017.\nThe Company returned $341 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter, consistent with its plan to return at least 50 percent of Operating Cash Flow in 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nCummins was named one of the world’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute, a leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. This is the 11th consecutive year Cummins has made Ethisphere’s list.

This includes $39 million associated with changes related to the Tax Legislation measurement period adjustment and $35 million associated with the one-time recognition of deferred tax charges at historical tax rates on intercompany profit in inventory.\nOur effective tax rate for the three months ended April 2, 2017, was 26.1 percent and contained only immaterial discrete tax items.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended April 1, 2018, versus the comparable period in 2017, was primarily due to the unfavorable discrete changes associated with the Tax Legislation passed in December 2017.\nENGINE SYSTEM CAMPAIGN ACCRUAL\nDuring 2017, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) selected certain of our pre-2013 model year engine systems for additional emissions testing. Some of these engine systems failed CARB and EPA tests as a result of degradation of an aftertreatment component. We have not been issued an official notice from the CARB or EPA regarding these particular engine systems. We continue to work with the agencies to develop a resolution of these matters. We are developing and testing a variety of solutions to address the technical issues, which could include a combination of calibration changes, additional service practices and hardware changes. We recorded a charge of $29 million to cost of sales in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in the third quarter of 2017 for the then expected cost of field campaigns to repair some of these engine systems. We have concluded based upon additional emission testing performed, and further discussions with the agencies in the first quarter of 2018, that the field campaigns should be expanded to include a larger population of our engine systems that are subject to the aftertreatment component degradation, including our model years 2010 through 2015. As a result, we recorded an additional charge of $187 million, or $0.87 per share, to cost of sales in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in the first quarter of 2018, to reflect our current estimated cost of these expanded campaigns.\nFor the engine populations under evaluation, we are in the process of finalizing the form and extent of solutions to address the technical matters. The accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2018 represents our current best estimate of the expected cost of our recommended courses of action to address these matters and is based upon certain assumptions about the effectiveness of our proposed solutions and the agencies' acceptance of those solutions. Since there are many variables with respect to these degradation issues, it is difficult to assess whether our future costs will be consistent with our current accrual for this matter. If, through the course of our ongoing internal work to develop and test our proposed solutions, it becomes apparent that more extensive repairs are required for certain populations of engine systems, or if the agencies do not accept our proposed solutions, then further charges may be recorded in the period in which our current assumptions change. It is reasonably possible that such changes in assumption could occur, with a range of zero, if our current proposed solutions are effective and approved, up to an incremental exposure of approximately $400 million above our recorded accrual at the end of the first quarter.\nWe do not currently expect any fines or penalties from the EPA or CARB related to this matter.\nCUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP\n(Unaudited)\nReconciliation of Non GAAP measures - Earnings before interest, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)\nEffective January 1, 2018, we use EBITDA as a primary basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. It is also a component in measuring our variable compensation programs. EBITDA assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard for depreciation and amortization, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. Our 2017 and 2016 EBITDA measures, as restated, were as follows:\nPower Total Intersegment In millions Engine Distribution Components Systems Segment Eliminations Total 2017 Q1 $ 273 $ 130 $ 216 $ 85 $ 704 $ 1 $ 705 Q2 323 127 228 90 768 (4 ) 764 Q3 276 120 259 111 766 22 788 Q4 271 123 214 125 733 36 769 2017 Total $ 1,143 $ 500 $ 917 $ 411 $ 2,971 $ 55 $ 3,026 2016 Total $ 849 $ 508 $ 774 $ 378 $ 2,509 $ 17 $ 2,526 EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.
