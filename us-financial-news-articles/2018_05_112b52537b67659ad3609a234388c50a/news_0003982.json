The April report, which will be scoured by analysts to provide clues on a likely U.S. interest rate trajectory, is likely to underscore labour market strength.\nThe average yield spread of emerging market hard currency bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries blew out by 23 basis points over the week to 331 basis points - its widest in more than a year.\nBut it was currencies that got a real drumming, with Turkey’s lira and Argentina’s peso finding themselves right in the line of fire.\n“There is an overall EM weakness which is coming mostly from the U.S. dollar strengthening in the past 10 days to two weeks, and also U.S. yields have increased,” said Sebastien Barbe, global head of EM research and strategy at Credit Agricole.\n“In the short-term, emerging market currencies may continue to depreciate on average,” Barbe said, adding he did expect the weakness to be limited to the weakest links.\nThe lira, which has been buffeted by a plethora of problems in recent months, is on track for a near-five percent fall over the week - its worst such performance since 2009.\nLatest data confirming stubbornly high inflation, large external financing needs, political pressure to lower interest rates and political uncertainty over snap elections to be held in June have weighed heavily on Turkish markets.\nMeanwhile the Argentine peso looks poised for a near 8 percent tumble in its worst week since Mauricio Macri devalued the currency after taking office in December 2015.\nAnd Argentina’s central bank ramping up benchmark interest rates by 300 bps - its second such move in less than a week - did nothing to stop the peso from swooning to a record low.\nBut others chalked up hefty losses too. South Africa’s rand is on track for a 2.5 percent decline in its sixth straight week in the red, with the currency having given up by now more than two-thirds of the gains made since Cyril Ramaphosa took the helm of the ruling ANC in December.\nMeanwhile Russia’s rouble, Mexico’s peso and China’s yuan were also all on track for weekly losses.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) (Reporting by Karin Strohecker Editing by Mark Heinrich)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5"], "published": "2018-05-04T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T13:00:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
