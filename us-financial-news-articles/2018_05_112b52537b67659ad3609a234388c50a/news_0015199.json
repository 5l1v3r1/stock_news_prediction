Inside each: a Buffett aphorism. On the evening schedule one night were cocktails and ping-pong, a sport Buffett plays that is also popular in China.\nAt one closed-door event, five groups of U.S. start-up companies presented ideas to Chinese investors in a “Shark Tank”-style forum held at the Nebraska Chinese Association, according to the group’s president, Linda Steele.\n“It’s not just people snapping pictures at Dairy Queen. There’s a lot going beyond the superficial. There’s real business going on here,” said Les Baquiran, founder of Pinebase, an online financial forum which sponsored several events aimed at Chinese investors in Omaha, including one that drew more than 400 people.\n“It would be more intense if everyone from China who wanted to come came.”\nA map of where Berkshire visitors came from, broadcast on Yahoo Finance, showed push-pins up and down the Middle Kingdom’s eastern coastline.\nBuffett and his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, are relatively well-known in China, where Buffett’s face appeared on cans of his beloved Cherry Coke.\nBuffett has been known to meet with groups of visiting students from China, while Munger pushed for the 2008 investment by a Berkshire subsidiary in Chinese electric carmaker BYD Co Ltd.\nBuffett took several questions from Chinese shareholders on Saturday, including one that elicited Buffett’s comment that Washington and Beijing are two intelligent superpowers who will avoid a trade war.

So if you find anything over there for me this is the time we should be acquiring something.” Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in Omaha; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Nick Zieminski", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T21:28:05.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
