On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading down 1.9% at $69.40 a barrel.\nSaudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih on Friday said he would enter into discussions in June with other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and external producers such as Russia to relax the output caps, Bloomberg reported.\nThe move comes in response to crude prices that have reached an almost three-year high and are beginning to hit consumers in the pocket.\nMr. Falih, the de facto head of OPEC, said consumer anxiety “is a concern to us,” according to Bloomberg.\n“You can interpret this in a bullish sense and a bearish sense,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, the chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets. “Putting some oil back into the market will prevent oil prices from going to $100 in the second half of 2018, which is good. But it also means that come 2019 there is no more buffer left and it is going to be needed.”\nOPEC and a handful of external producers such as Russia have been involved in an effort since 2016 to remove almost 2% of the global crude supply in a bid to prop up crude’s value.\nAnalysts are projecting that the oil market will move into a deficit in the second part of this year and 2019 of 0.5 million barrels and later 0.3 million barrels a day as demand outstrips supply.\nAn employee stands at a site inside the Zubair oil and gas field, north of the southern Iraqi province of Basra.

ICE gas oil changed hands at $682.50 a metric ton, down $16.75 from the previous settlement.\nWrite to Neanda Salvaterra at neanda.salvaterra@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T19:07:57.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
