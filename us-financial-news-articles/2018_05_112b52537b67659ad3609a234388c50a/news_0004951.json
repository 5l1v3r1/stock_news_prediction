(“Columbia Pipeline”) (formerly NYSE:CPGX) on May 18, 2016 . You are hereby notified that Levi & Korsinsky filed a securities class action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, Case No. 1:18-cv-03670. To get more information go to:\nhttp://www.zlk.com/pslra-cm/columbia-pipeline-group-inc\nor contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500, toll-free: (877) 363-5972. There is no cost or obligation to you.\nThe complaint alleges that Columbia Pipeline failed to disclose material information in its Proxy statement related to the then-proposed merger of Columbia Pipeline with TransCanada. In particular, it is alleged that the Proxy failed to disclose that Columbia Pipeline and its executive officers: (1) conspired to engineer the Spinoff from NiSource, and ultimate sale of the Company to TransCanada, as part of a plan to cash in on change-in-control benefits; (2) concealed TransCanada’s prior expressions of interest to purchase the Pre-Spinoff Entities directly from NiSource; (3) excluded prospective buyers from bidding, thereby preferencing TransCanada to the detriment of Columbia Pipeline shareholders; (4) negotiated standstill agreements, and waivers therefrom, with various prospective buyers to rush to consummate the Merger with TransCanada, thereby triggering the change-in-control benefits; and (5) did not negotiate to maximize the value of Columbia Pipeline shares in the Merger.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 29, 2018 . Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.\nLevi & Korsinsky is a national firm with offices in New York, California, Connecticut, and Washington D.C. The firm’s attorneys have extensive expertise and experience representing investors in securities litigation, and have recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders.
