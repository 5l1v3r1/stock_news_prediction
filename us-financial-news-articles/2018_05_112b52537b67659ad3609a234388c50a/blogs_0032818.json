Most people questioned by Reuters said they did not understand the constitutional changes and were only voting out of fear.\nA 50-year-old man, who did not want to be identified to avoid being targeted for retribution, said turnout was high “not because of good will but because of fear”.\n“There has been intimidation - whoever doesn’t go to vote is going against the government’s will,” the man said.\nBurundi's opposition leader and deputy speaker in parliament Agathon Rwasa, greets a woman after casting his ballot at a polling centre during the constitutional amendment referendum in Kiremba commune in Ngozi province, Burundi May 17, 2018. REUTERS/Evrard Ngendakumana BALLOT CRITICISED Human rights groups and the opposition Front for Democracy in Burundi criticized the run up to the ballot, which the U.S. State Department earlier this month said could hurt Burundi’s institutions.\nThe BBC and Voice of America have been banned for violating broadcasting regulations — accusations they deny — leaving Burundi’s 10 million people largely reliant on state-run media controlled by Nkurunziza’s allies for information on the poll.\nThe government has denied the vote will be anything but free and fair.\n“I do not know what ‘yes’ or ‘no’ means since I did not see or read that new constitution,” a 45-year old woman told Reuters after she cast her vote in the capital Bujumbura. She requested anonymity for safety reasons.\nSome 430,000 refugees - many opponents of the president -have fled since the 2015 elections. Most have fled to Tanzania and Rwanda.\nThe country still suffers bouts of political violence — at least 26 people were killed in an attack in a rural province this month.\nIn the run up to the vote opposition politicians and rights groups have also reported arrests of dissidents, the breaking up of “no” rallies and death threats issued by the Imbonerakure, the youth wing of Nkurunziza’s ruling CNDD-FDD.\nInterior Minister official Therence Ntahiraja said such reports were “a blatant lie”.\nBurundi is not the only African country whose leaders have amended the rules to prolong their stay in power.\nSlideshow (6 Images) Rwandan President Paul Kagame secured a change to the constitution that could allow him to remain in office until 2034.
