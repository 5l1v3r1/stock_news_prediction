I said I’d take Parma back to Serie A. I kept my promise,” the tearful 41-year-old defender told Sky Sport Italia.\n“This is a journey we started three years ago in front of these amazing fans. We had difficult moments, we always got back on our feet. They never gave up and I am proud to have been their captain.\n“Now I can stop. I don’t know, we’ll see. I just need to celebrate right now.”\nFrosinone were leading Foggia 2-1 with a minute remaining but conceded an equaliser to miss out on automatic promotion due to an inferior head-to-head record against Parma.\nThat led to dramatic scenes at Spezia as the news came through from Lazio.\n“It can’t be real, it’s impossible,” Lucarelli added. “Nobody could’ve imagined a finale like this, not even in my wildest dreams. The others were celebrating, then we heard a huge cheer from the stands. I don’t know what happened.”\nFrosinone, who spent one season in Serie A two years ago, could still return to the top flight through the promotion playoffs, which also feature Venezia, Perugia, Bari, Cittadella and Palermo.
