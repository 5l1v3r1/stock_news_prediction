That is another good reason for keeping the deal while building on it in order to take account of the legitimate concerns of the US and our other allies.”\nReporting by Stephen Addison; editing by Michael Holden\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:48:29.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
