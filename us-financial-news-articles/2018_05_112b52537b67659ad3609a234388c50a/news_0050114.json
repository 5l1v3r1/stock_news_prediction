A week earlier, 30-year rates averaged 4.61 percent, the U.S. mortgage finance agency said.\nLast Friday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 3.128 percent, the highest since July 2011, according to Reuters data.\nFifteen-year loan rates averaged 4.15 percent, up from 4.08 percent from the prior week.\nInterest rates on five-year adjustable rate mortgages averaged 3.87 percent, higher than 3.82 percent the week before.
