However, the incidents highlight the concern the United States has about a Chinese military base just miles from a critical U.S. base in Djibouti.\n“They are very serious incidents ... We have formally démarched the Chinese government and we’ve requested the Chinese investigate these incidents,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told reporters.\nWhite said the Pentagon was confident that the lasers had been pointed by Chinese nationals and in the past few weeks fewer than 10 incidents had taken place. The intent was unclear.\nA U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that in one incident last month two pilots in a C-130 suffered minor eye injuries.\nThe official said that in a few instances, military grade lasers from the Chinese base had been pointed at aircraft.\nDjibouti is strategically located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal.\nDjibouti hosts a U.S. military base that is home to about 4,000 personnel, including special operations forces, and is a launch pad for operations in Yemen and Somalia.\nThis year, the U.S. military put countering China, along with Russia, at the center of a new national defense strategy.\nReporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T20:49:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
