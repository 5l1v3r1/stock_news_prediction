(OTC: XALL), a company focusing on accelerating fintech companies, leveraging blockchain technology for financial reconciliation, and payment auditing solutions, this week executed a Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of Co-Owners Rewards Inc., a consumer payment rewards company.\nXalles will leverage this acquisition to expand its reach into the lucrative consumer payments market. Co-Owners Rewards is planning to launch a unique rewards program linked to consumer payment cards and mobile payments. Co-Owners Rewards Inc. is also the sole shareholder of Amazing Living Enterprises Inc., a network and referral marketing firm which currently distributes healthy consumer products, administrates an affiliate management program, and manages a prepaid card program for its members. Amazing Living launched its Amazing Living Mall earlier this year. The “mall” is an e-commerce shopping experience that provides the consumer with access to over 1,200 major retailers and service providers, including Walmart®, BestBuy®, Home Depot®, Expedia®, and many others, but with the added benefit of receiving cash back rebates on each purchase.\n“This acquisition gives Xalles two new, foundational building blocks in the consumer e-commerce and payments space,” said Xalles CEO, Thomas Nash. He continued, “We will continue to seek out strategic acquisition targets that will complement these businesses and add value to our company.”\nThe Co-Owners and Amazing Living acquisition transaction is planned to close on, or before, May 15, 2018.
