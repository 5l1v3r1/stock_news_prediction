The power was also out in the national capital, Islamabad.\nKhan said it was hoped power would be restored soon with “gradual restoration of grids and feeders.”\nMedia showed pictures of people sweltering at the hottest time of the year in markets and offices.\nThe ruling party won the last election, in 2013, vowing to end power outages before the next polls.\nPower cuts and scheduled outages, known as load shedding, in urban areas have been sharply reduced from about 12 hours a day previously to only occasional outages now.\nReporting by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Drazen Jorgic, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:06:41.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
