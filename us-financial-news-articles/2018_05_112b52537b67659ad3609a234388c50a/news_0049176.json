Related Coverage U.S. Commerce Dept will probe whether auto imports hurt national security\nGrowing trade tensions over cars and car parts, particularly with China, could raise risks for U.S. companies expanding their presence in the country, signs of which are already emerging.\nEarlier this month, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co’s ( F.N ) imported vehicles were being held up at Chinese ports, adding to a growing list of U.S. products facing issues at China’s borders.\nThe majority of vehicles sold in the United States by Japanese and South Korean automakers are produced there, but most also export to the U.S. from plants in Asia, Mexico, Canada and other countries.\nRoughly one-third of all U.S. vehicle imports last year were from Asia.\nIn addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, the administration has threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods over intellectual property complaints, and Beijing has vowed to respond.\nThe administration is also trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to return more auto production to the United States.\nCommerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the U.S. “internal economy” and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems, autonomous vehicles, fuel cells, electric motors and batteries, and advanced manufacturing processes.\nIn a separate statement, President Donald Trump said: “Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.” Slideshow (2 Images)\nA Trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring Canada and Mexico to make concessions in talks to update the NAFTA that have languished in part over auto provisions, as well as pressuring Japan and the European Union, which also export large numbers of vehicles to the United States. ‘FEWER CHOICES, HIGHER PRICES’\nAn ad hoc industry group representing the largest Japanese, German and other foreign automakers called “Here for America,” criticized the effort.\n“To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America,” said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ), Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) and others, who also speaks for the broader group.\nA Toyota spokeswoman said that the company was monitoring the situation.\nChinese automaker Geely Holding Group urged free trade practices for the auto industry, which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries.\n“As a global manufacturer, Geely Holding Group is in favor of free trade and open markets. Free trade creates jobs, wealth and economic growth,” a spokesman said, adding that its plant in South Carolina to produce its Volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country.\nLate last week, Japan’s automakers’ association urged its export partners to keep tariffs on vehicles and components low and maintain free trade relationships.\nRoughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the United States last year, while the country imported 8.3 million vehicles worth $192 billion. This included 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics.\nAt the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion.\nGerman automakers Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ), Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) and BMW AG ( BMWG.DE ) all have large U.S. assembly plants. The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany’s biggest source of export income.\nAsked if the measures would hit Mexico and Canada, a Mexican source close to the NAFTA talks said: “That probably is going to be the next battle.” Reporting by David Shepardson and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by James Oliphant, Makini Brice and David Lawder in Washington, Anthony Esposito in Mexico City; Naomi Tajitsu in Tokyo and Yawen Chen in Beijing; Writing by David Lawder and David Shepardson; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Peter Cooney & Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T01:17:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
