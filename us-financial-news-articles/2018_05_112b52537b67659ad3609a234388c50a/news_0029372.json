TPG bought a majority stake in 2015 in Poundworld, which competes with rival group Poundland and other discount groups.\nThe person familiar with the situation said information on Poundworld had been sent to a variety of potential buyers and there were early signs of interest. It expects the process to be managed over a short timeframe to allow any new buyer to continue the restructuring if required.\nPoundworld is not the only retailer to be struggling in Britain at the moment where consumers are strapped for cash and increasingly shopping online.\nAlready this year Toys R Us UK, electricals group Maplin and drinks wholesaler Conviviality have collapsed, while fashion retailer New Look is closing stores.\nThe possible Poundworld sale was first reported by Sky News. TPG and Poundworld declined to comment on Saturday.\nReporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Alexander Smith and Ros Russell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:35:11.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
