France, Spain, Netherlands and Belgium were only slightly better, with board terms of four years.\nBritain, Ireland, Switzerland and the Nordics all had strong accountability, with one-year terms for directors, it said.\n“Well-governed companies are better positioned to navigate challenging economic conditions while protecting shareholder interests,” said Rob Walker, head of Asset Stewardship, EMEA, at State Street Global Advisors.\n“Without an annual director election process, shareholders are limited in their ability to hold directors accountable and improve board quality.” Reporting by Simon Jessop; editing by Emma Rumney", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:06:39.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
